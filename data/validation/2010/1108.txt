 Mr President, I was prevented from speaking earlier. One of the claimed benefits of EU membership is free movement of peoples, and the EU is quick to condemn Switzerland’s democratic referendum results. So why were seven qualified British ski instructors, legally working in France, treated like criminals, thrown into freezing cells and now facing three months in jail when they have every right to work there? Should this Parliament not demand their immediate release, and – I must be careful how I say this – is this ‘piste war’ not totally in breach of EU rules?

 Mr President, I happen to have been at the United Nations and Security Council yesterday, in snowy New York. I support this UN multilateral treaty on controlling conventional arms sales both in general terms and because it has been signed by the UK.  It is vital here to stress the difference between the United Nations, which is intergovernmental – i.e. agreements are made between the governments of 193 individual nations, 154 of which have signed this agreement – and the European Union, which is supra- or trans-national – i.e. it cuts above or across nation states. I do not agree with that approach. Indeed, the official UN brochure I have here says that the UN is not a super-state, nor is it a world government. The states members of the UN remain sovereign and equal and have no intention of delegating this sovereignty to any supra-national entity. The point is that, as long as this report does acknowledge decision-making is done at national state level, then it is an advance. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

I made the decision to vote against this report as I do not agree in principle with a new EU action for the European Capitals of Culture, which it has seized from the Council of Europe. This is the European Union promoting a shared European cultural identity which I see as undermining the identities of Member States. I do not see the European Capitals of Culture as a valid use of time and funding and it will be even more of a detriment if used as a political and ideological tool to foist a non-existent cultural brand on Member States. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Madam President, all of us here value and support human rights, but people are deeply concerned about excessive rights for criminals, murderers and terrorists. The European Court of Human Rights, across the water over here, wants the UK to give the vote to prisoners, and in the EU we have the Fundamental Charter of Human Rights, under Lisbon, and the havoc caused in trade deals as a result of it.   At the same time, the EU is supporting Edward Snowden, who is a traitor in the US. And in this report we have the European instrument for democracy and human rights. It has a budget of over a billion euros and what is it doing? Well, it spent USD 2.6 million in the USA to oppose the death penalty. That is a matter for America, not the EU. The EU must stop trying to run the world when it cannot even get its own accounts signed off. I oppose yet more EU waste. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I voted against this report as it is a gross intervention in national affairs and national sovereignty. There may indeed be rights abuses in Hungary, but it is for the Hungarian people to address these concerns and not the EU. This is how the EU works: it takes a good cause such as this and it makes it its business, but it is not the EU’s business. This idea of a wise men group, an investigative body of MEPs looking into the rights of all 28 Member States – we are not just talking about Hungary in this report – takes away our democratic rights; it does not add to those rights.  I think this proposal crosses the Rubicon and, just as when Julius Caesar crossed that Rubicon, there is no way back. It marks the start of a European empire interfering in nation states’ matters. And as Julius Caesar said, the die is indeed cast. I think this report absolutely says that. We must go against this. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I know that Mr Duff is commendably honest and direct about being an arch-federalist – a true believer in the European superstate. That is something that five million people in the East of England have no desire for at all, and it is noticeable that his party, the Lib Dems, is not supporting a democratic ‘in/out’ referendum vote this Friday in Westminster.  However, this report is outrageous even in federalist terms. It advocates that European political parties should stand in British elections, complete with their own emblems and their own political broadcasts on TV. I believe that the EPP here is already busy raising GBP 5 million to spend on the forthcoming election. The report is in favour of European political parties nominating candidates like Mr Barroso for the post of President of the European Commission. I think this is a false and worthless measure, a sort of GDR-style democracy. The report also advocates extending candidacy to EU citizens … (The President cut off the speaker) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Mr President, these proposals have created great concern in my constituency in the east of England. They cover powered two- and three-wheelers, light trailers, tractors and older cars. It does seem to be a case of just trying to harmonise because of a political super-state, rather than because of any real need, value or urgency. If you take motorcycles in particular, EU studies actually find that less than 1% of motorcycle crashes are directly caused by defects, so this proposal really is not needed. Parliament’s own Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have rejected these proposals. I feel that this proposal is completely disproportionate to any problems it claims to solve. It goes against subsidiarity, which should enable national measures for national road safety priorities, and it really does seem to be another case of looking for a solution to a problem that does not exist, and merely increases cost and bureaucracy. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, I welcome the limited reforms passed today. All credit should go to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall for his sterling efforts on this issue, and also to the ECR group. I fear, however, that this is still rather like spraying perfume on a long-dead fish: the bad odour lingers. The common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a disaster. Not only has it failed to secure fish stocks, but it has also failed to help the employment situation in fishing, around the UK and around Europe. The fishing community in the east of England has been devastated by the CFP. And the issue of discards in particular, the fact that good, perfectly edible fish – up to 90% of them in some areas – are dumped back in the sea, is a complete disgrace. Given that Norway and Iceland have not had a policy of discards, and call such a policy criminal, why has it taken the EU so long to follow them? Provisions such as Amendment 119, which I voted against today, seeking to allow discards, are still a disgrace. The problem continues. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, this proposal is the thin end of a giant EU wedge. It is an attempt to introduce harmonised EU taxation and a common tax regime for the EU. It is intended to save the euro zone, but it is a bit like a drowning man pulling others down with him. While it only applies to eleven countries now, it will be expanded. You can see that happening. The City of London, as one of the largest financial centres in the world, will be its aim. Therefore, I vigorously oppose this proposal. The Dutch Finance Minister called it catastrophic, and the Swedish Finance Minister called it a very dangerous thing. This is a disastrous proposal and I voted to veto it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, the people of my country are very concerned at paying yet more money to the EU. We are paying GBP 53 million a day gross, which is GBP 30 million a day net. We are also talking now of GBP 118 billion a year in terms of red tape or regulations, and the accounts have still not been signed off for the EU for 18 years in a row.  This is not good enough – and now the EU wants one-and-a-half billion more this year and yet more for the next seven years. What planet is the EU living on? Is it Mars or Venus or Pluto? This is not real. What is real is that the people of Greece are suffering; the conditions in Greece now are worse than Germany in the 1930s because of the political euro. That is a disgrace, and here we are in Strasbourg – 200 million euros a year to come back and forward between Brussels and Strasbourg. This is a disgrace; we must cut back on the budget. Not a penny more till the EU gets its house in order. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, this resolution is completely unacceptable. It is the equivalent of sending EU tanks across national borders. There is no acceptable EU role in these vital, strategic and offence responsibilities, and no role for Commission legislation. Just look at the language. The EU ‘should be a global political player on the international scene’ it says, ‘to protect its
 interests in the world and to ensure the security of its
 citizens’. All under the roof of a single political authority. It says, the EU has ‘an important role to play as security provider for the Member States’ and it wants mergers of European businesses to contribute to European defence industry. Well, here is the real aim of this shameful BAE/EADS merger proposal. But worst of all, it wants to take the EU to war. It talks of having the ‘full range of possibilities for action on the international scene’, of intervening ‘in all types of crisis, including […] high intensity conflicts’ – and that means war. No, this resolution must be stopped in its tracks. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Madam President, I very much welcome Russia joining the WTO. I think the issue, though, is about whether Russia successfully adopts WTO procedures. What does joining the WTO actually mean in practice? The official commitments include non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, reducing tariffs and binding tariff levels, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights and foregoing the use of local content requirements and other investment measures which limit imports. It also requires them to open government procurement contract opportunities to foreign firms and to accept that the WTO will settle trade dispute procedures. That is quite a long list for Russia to sign up to. It is quite a challenge for Russia. For example, Russia has export duties on no less than 450 types of products at the moment, and duties will be reduced from 19 % to an average of 8 %. Russia is still a tough place to do business. It is ranked 120 in the world ‘ease of doing business’ rankings, and Putin called the accession process to the WTO an ambush of Russian economic interests. So I very much welcome the move towards the WTO, but there are some tough challenges ahead. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have to say that I can scarcely believe these proposals. I feel that they are utter nonsense and it should worry democrats that two-thirds of MEPs supported this motion. I did not. How can we throw money away on such nonsense when the peoples of Europe are hurting? As they are in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in France and in my own country. The EU is clearly hopelessly out of touch with the people it purports to represent. At a time when Angela Merkel today is threatening to veto the entire budget summit if David Cameron vetoes anything but a freeze, this is crazy. David Cameron is trying to do the right thing. Are the peoples of Europe, in between paying higher taxes, in between job cuts and riots, turning to one another to say that what we really need is a Year of European Citizenship? No, absolutely not. Nor am I a citizen of the EU, but a loyal subject of the Queen. The idea is flawed, insulting and an utter waste of money. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against this report as I find the notion of a single European railway area a ridiculous, unnecessary and unwelcome intrusion into domestic affairs. There is no need for Fritz the Tank Engine or for a single EU Fat Controller for our railways. It is true that international, rather than regional, agreements are valuable for air and maritime transport, as are single market measures for rail suppliers. But the United Kingdom is a large island with only one rail connection with continental Europe and it has no road connections at all. So for road and rail, it does not work. I think this proposal does nothing but confuse priorities and drive up costs. In East Anglia, my constituency, hard-pressed rail users do not stand on platforms demanding a single European railway area. They need better services, less crowding and reasonable ticket prices. This is a silly single rail area proposal and it should not be allowed. It should not leave the station. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, the ACTA agreement is one I wish I could champion. I very much agree we need measures to counter piracy and protect intellectual property, which is vital to business, but I cannot support this ACTA. It is not acceptable in its current form. It is too catch-all. Whilst the thrust of the agreement is worthy, the devil is in the detail. In the detail, we find that Internet service providers will be forced to spy on all their customers, Chinese-state style, becoming legally responsible for pirated files. Search engines could be closed for aiding and abetting. In this ACTA, we have what I call ‘pre-crime’, as in the movie Minority Report
, where you can have your PCCs on the mere suspicion of infringement. You have a loose definition of commercial scale, which could see many law-abiding citizens prosecuted for very low-key usage. You have customs officers able to go through your files at airports, and we have this unaccountable ACTA committee which has the power to make changes without referring back to this Parliament or others. In conclusion, I support the aim but I do not support the detail of ACTA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Blue-card answer. 
– I have read it in English so I do understand it. I have taken the trouble to go through this and so have my researchers. I think honestly you have to judge it on the legal detail in that agreement. That is what I have made my decision on, not on a lot of e-mails I have received – we have all received those – but on the actual detail and what it says in that agreement. I do not think, unfortunately, that that is acceptable. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted for this as I believe that trade, rather than aid, is a better way to assist less developed countries to prosper. However, I want to make a wider point about tariff reduction and trade agreements relevant to all of us. Here, we see preferential access to the EU single market being given to nations which are not members of the EU but which get reduced – or even zero – tariff walls from the EU customs union. Yet they do not have to sign up to financial contributions to the EU or to a whole body of law, the acquis
, and can trade pretty freely. It goes to show how far we have travelled from the 1970s world of high tariffs and menacing trade walls and how much has been achieved by the WTO and GATT in reducing barriers to trade around the world. We can all benefit from much looser trading relations and lower tariff walls. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report as it is another classic case of the right idea but in the wrong place. Of course we all want to see better human rights records around the world. I personally raised the issue of human rights with President Santos of Colombia last year and I was impressed with his commitment to improve human rights in a country which has suffered from 50 years of guerrilla warfare. But this is to confuse political agreements about political measures with trade agreements, which should be about jobs and market access. Trade agreements are not trade agreements when they become weighed down with non-trade issues. No matter how worthy those issues are, it is not desirable or effective to confuse the two, nor can you switch trade agreements on and off like light switches, as this report suggests, so that every accusation on human rights leads to the suspension of the agreement. That is a recipe for chaos, confusion and misery, for lost jobs and lost opportunities, and we cannot afford that, especially not at this time. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have two questions to ask Baroness Ashton as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Firstly, I do not understand what the EU role is in this United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Here is a very welcome agreement concluded by the intra-governmental United Nations with 193 nation states involved – only Zimbabwe voted against it – so nation states and the UN are at one. Why, then, do we need a supranational trespasser, in the form of the EU, to muscle in on the action? A second related question is what role does the European Defence Agency (EDA) have, given its arms export control policy? At least EDA, again, is international, not supranational. But why did it allegedly take you from 1 December 2009, when you were appointed as Head of the EDA, to January 2012 – two years – to actually visit its premises? It is only 15 minutes from your Brussels office. Is it actually so low priority? David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I am very much in favour of equal work for equal value and of fair treatment, but the issue here is: who enforces that? We do not need the EU to dictate to sovereign nations yet more top-down equalities legislation in yet another power grab. Pay should not be set at the EU level. With the state of the European economies at present, this enforcement really does not help – it is like tying weights to someone who is already drowning. Already the engine of our economies – small businesses – are suffering from too many unnecessary, costly and over-the-top regulations, such as the disgraceful, out-of-control UK employment tribunal system, where 90% of those laws come from the EU and which really acts as licensed blackmail. Thankfully, the UK Government is cutting that back. But business really does not need this – not when one in five young people in the EU are out of work and when the EU share of GDP wealth is falling so alarmingly. We have to ensure that all intervention is constructive; this is not. Then there is the EU’s Equality Directive, which was dressed up as Harriet Harman’s Equality Act. Civitas actually estimated that that directive alone cost GBP 150 million in the service sector and 210 million across SMEs, across the UK. It is too much. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Kolarska-Bobińska, no, absolutely not. I do compliment the report. As I said quite clearly, I am in favour of equal pay for equal work. That principle is very important. What I query is whether this should be done at EU level. I do not believe it should be; it should be for nation states. However, I absolutely agree with you on the principle. It is the intervention at EU level, the heavy costs of that and the power of the EU over sovereign states that I object to. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Morin-Chartier, I agree with that. I accept in this report that career breaks actually cause a lot of loss of income and affect this. As I say, I am very much in favour in the thrust of it. What I am saying is that this should be down to nation states to do and should not be enforced – which this legislation associated with a good report does. That is the problem. It is not the report, because that is a very good report in many respects. It is the legislation, done top-down from the EU, which I object to. The great thrust of it is very good, but it should be done through nation states. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the ECR Group. 
– Mr President, I am alarmed at the tendency of the European Union to trespass into areas of national sovereignty where it does not belong; this is another example of that trend. It is the rightful business of the Canadian Government – and not us – to decide who it lets into its country, and why. Canada is not discriminating against us Europeans: it introduced similar restrictions for Mexicans, even though Mexico is in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada has successfully lifted the requirement for temporary visas where conditions are met. It has done so for Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary. There seems to be serious confusion in the Commission’s stance in two regards. Firstly, there is confusion as to whether such visa matters belong in free trade agreements. They do not; just as ‘Mode 4’ worker access is not appropriate in the draft EU/India free trade agreement, so traveller visa matters do not belong in this Canadian free trade agreement. Border issues like this are a matter for Member States. The second point of confusion is about the European Union being a country. Yes, it aspires to be a country, but it is not one yet. So it is not the business of this place to force Canada to treat every EU nation equally, as if we were one country. That is a matter for individual nation states working through their own embassies. The Canadians have laid down fair and reasonable criteria, including low immigration violation rates, low asylum claims, high integrity of travel documents and good cooperation on removals. Those are reasonable terms. If this principle is breached, however, every EU Member State can expect the EU to start dictating all its border matters, and many EU Member States may well dislike losing control of their own borders to EU diktats. France and Spain have suspended Schengen on occasion, as has Spain this month, and the Dutch have tried to block Bulgaria and Romania. So in conclusion, Mr President, this is a line in the sand; a legal and political border that the EU must not cross. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Parvanova, I think the point you are missing is that they are all nation states. The objection I have is to pretending that the EU is one country and saying that we are trying to force equality on Canada as if the EU were one country. By all means let the national embassies argue with the Canadian authorities and do it for themselves, but I do not think the EU should be acting this way, and certainly not within free trade agreements. I am on the Committee on International Trade, and too much leeway is being given to items which are not to do with trade and jobs. Europe desperately needs trade and jobs at this point. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– The answer is that, as part of being a member of the European Union, every member country, such as Britain, has to hand over the negotiation of free trade agreements to the EU. I personally think that Britain should be outside the European Union and negotiate its own free trade agreements, as do Norway and Switzerland – and we would get a better result. That is the reason that is driving it. I am in favour of trade and of helping Europe get better jobs – I think we all are here – but I think there are better ways of doing it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because I do not believe that the EU should be involved in social security matters. I think it is trespassing on international responsibilities, and it seems to be a world away from the trade agreement that the EU is meant to be about. I am particularly concerned about one aspect. I was self-employed myself: I ran a consultancy. This report refers to paying unemployment benefits to the self-employed throughout the EU. This again is undermining our flexible economy. In Britain, when you are self-employed, you do things your own way and it gives people a lot of freedom. I think that is undermining this freedom. This report may be about technical matters but I am totally against it on principle. The EU should keep out of social security, pension and benefit matters. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report, not because I do not believe in human rights – I very much do – but because Conservative MEPs and I all feel that human rights are really about balance and getting the balance right. I have to say that my colleague who wrote this report, Richard Howitt, did not show much balance when he supported the rights of illegal travellers on illegal pitches at Dale Farm, whilst ignoring the rights of those local people who were so badly affected by them. That showed contempt for the rule of law. I am concerned that there is also a lack of balance in this report over things such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Just yesterday, the British Government acted – quite rightly – to arrest Abu Qatada, who is an alleged terrorist and a man who has actually praised the hijackers of 9/11, after eight years. It took eight years to do that because of human rights legislation. This report supports that move towards the EU Convention on Human Rights and EU support for it. So, let us get the balance right. Human rights are good, but if the balance is not correct, it weakens the whole case for them. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, at a time of economic difficulty across the world, and particularly in the eurozone, and with the EU budget itself under enormous pressure, I cannot see the justification for shelling out huge amounts of cash this way. The report talks of up to EUR 6 000 per head per refugee, and a minimum of EUR 4 000. Britain has a noble history of providing shelter to genuine asylum seekers and takes more than its fair share of the load, but these common EU priorities of ‘resettlement’ are unwelcome, unhelpful and unaffordable. That is why I voted against this fund. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because it shows all so clearly that the British people were lied to about the true intention of the European Union project. It is about take-over, not about trade. This Vălean report wants harmonised tax, social security, state benefits, pensions, even divorce laws right across the EU. What is this to do with trade? What is this to do with the common market? It is about harmonising arrangements to create a single European state. Well, I am not an EU citizen and I will not be an EU citizen. I am a loyal subject of Her Majesty The Queen, in her 60th year of rule, and this Vălean report is an insult to that loyalty. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I voted against Iceland joining the EU because I think, as two-thirds of Icelandic people thought in a poll just last month, that Iceland would be mad to join the EU. Mad because membership would destroy Iceland’s key industry – fishing – through the disastrous common fisheries policy, just as it has destroyed 100 000 jobs in the UK in fishing and nearly all the fishing in my own constituency of the East of England. Mad because they would have to join the disastrous euro as well and abandon the free floating króna, which has brought a boom in exports. Mad, too, because its economy would be weighed down with a barrage of EU red tape. Its growth rate is currently 3.1%, whereas the EU’s GDP forecast is 0 for this year. Why risk it? As for Icesave, there are other legal mechanisms outside the EU, such as the EFTA court, which has already ruled that Iceland must pay up. So we must stop kidding ourselves in the EU that Iceland wants to join. Iceland’s sane option, as I believe Britain’s is too, is to stay proud, independent and self-governing. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against EU stability bonds, or Eurobonds, as they fail to address the central problem: the euro itself. It is clear the euro is a dangerous and failed construct, and no political posturing or economic gesturing gets us away from the basic truth that the euro is disastrous for the world economy. The sooner troubled nations like Greece devalue and default, the better. The cure is now more dangerous and deadly than the malady. Is there no end to these desperate measures to prop up this political currency? The trampling of democracy in Greece, Italy and elsewhere by the EU’s new inner politburo, the Frankfurt Group, so that Europe erupts in flames. Barroso and Van Rompuy going cap in hand to China for rescue funds – and at what price? Gerrymandering Lagarde into the IMF so the IMF is misused as a new euro bailout fund. Weimar-like plans to print EUR 2 trillion to buy rubbish bonds; new wheelbarrows to carry all the notes. For God’s sake, for all our sakes, let the euro go. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report. Whilst I salute what David Cameron did for defending vital national interests over the rules at the recent summit, actually the purpose of it was to put in place a financial plan to save the euro and it failed to do that. In my view, what is much more scary than the full or partial collapse of the euro – damaging as that would be – is the notion of the European Central Bank printing EUR 2 trillion or more with nothing to back the paper they are printing. I think Angela Merkel is right, but she has been isolated on this because she wants to avoid the nightmare scenario, quite rightly, of a return to the Weimar Republic. In my view, it is better for an orderly end to the euro, or parts of the euro, than wheelbarrows full of worthless notes. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). 
 – Mr President, this vote reflects on the similarities and differences between the United States of America and the aspirate United States of Europe, or USE. The US is democratic, free-trading, entrepreneurial and capitalist; the USE is corporatist, protectionist, statist and interventionist. The US are states of a federal country with one prevailing culture and speaking one language; the USE is made up of nation states, very different to just states, and has a multitude of cultures and languages. The US has the dollar, a single currency that is still strong despite a debt of USD 12 trillion. The USE has a single currency on the point of collapse. And when Americans have frequent referenda and elect even insurance commissioners and registers of deeds; the USE puts Soviet-style placemen, little Honeckers at the head of its nation states. This statement may accentuate the similarities, but in truth, the differences are plain to see. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I am deeply unimpressed with this idea of a European Heritage Label ‘to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the EU’. Once again, we seem to have a scary 1984-style rewriting of history, just like the wasteful Museum of European History, where no-one can agree when this history is due to start and where, of course, no-one can mention the war. This is an Orwellian exercise that seeks to term World Wars as mere European civil wars, with the realities obscured in a haze of half-truths. In Brussels last week a French lady insulted my red Remembrance Day poppy as ‘out of date’. I find it disgusting that a symbol of the huge sacrifice that has guaranteed all our freedoms should be treated with such contempt. That poppy commemorates, too, the British soldier who died just last week in Afghanistan. History may be inconvenient and painful but, by God, you get into far more trouble seeking to deny its realities. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I speak as someone with a railway industry background. I worked for Britain’s passenger railways, the Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link, and as a ministerial adviser. Whilst I support the concept of a British-style model of liberalised rail services, which has given the UK the fastest-growing railways in Europe, of track charges, of open access, of train leasing and of a strong and independent rail regulator, I simply do not see this as anything to do with the European Union. Britain has 10 000 miles of rail lines and only one line is connected to Europe. Continental-gauge trains would not even fit on our lines in Britain. They would demolish our bridges and tunnels with their bulk. So I am sorry, but this idea of a single European railway area is a nonsense. It is unnecessary, undesirable and excessive interference in the responsibilities of national governments, so I do not support this report. In short, will the EU please keep off our tracks!

 My hobby is writing film scripts so I declare an interest in this subject. But whilst this report might claim to be about new ‘Cinema Paradiso’s, it is more likely to lead to ‘Cinema Disastroso’. Why does the EU want to discriminate against non-European films? Firstly, this is a form of non-tariff barrier and against WTO rules. Second, filmmaking is incredibly international these days – defining a non-European film is difficult: is Harry Potter or James Bond an American film for its production, finance and distribution, or British by dint of talent, theme, location and studios used? The ‘Fifth Element’ may be directed by Frenchman Luc Besson but Bruce Willis is the star. Even the iconic French film ‘Chocolat’ had substantial US support. Third, you simply cannot force people to watch films they do not want to see. European movies can be winners without giving away seats: ‘Chocolat’ took USD 71 million at the box office, ‘Amélie’ USD 152 million and “The King’s Speech” USD 386 million. Any support for film is better targeted on developing good stories or in skills development, not in seeking to prop up films no one wants to see. That is why on principle I could not vote for this report, whilst being very much in support of the film industry. David Campbell Bannermann  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I am a friend of Israel but I am a critical friend of Israel. I myself worked with the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process and it is illusory to believe in a military solution; it has to be a political solution, and that involves negotiation. Legal settlements do not help that process. I do feel for the Palestinian people who have been very badly treated; I do believe that they need a state living in peace with Israel, side by side. However, I am not sure that this measure – which is a good negotiating tactic – of going straight to the UN to create a state is the right way forward, so I abstained on this vote. However, I do wish that the peace process moves forward. I think that is essential. But only painstaking negotiation, as we saw in the Northern Ireland peace process, can bring a political solution of benefit to everyone. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, many people have no idea how much national legislation emanates from the European Union. In the UK, it is estimated that there are now 100 000 laws, regulations, directives and decisions which come from the EU and have been imposed on the country. It is estimated that this collective legal burden, known as corpus juris
, costs between 4% and 10% of annual wealth in Britain. It is also estimated that the cost of such over-regulation is EUR 600 billion a year across the EU, and GBP 118 billion within the UK. Surely it is time to turn off this legislative sausage machine. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I commend my colleague, Sajjad Karim, on a sensible report that takes us back in the right direction. The emphasis on subsidiarity is correct. 90% of the British economy has nothing to do with trade with the EU, and 80% of that economy is trade within the UK, but we have to apply all of these EU laws – 100 000 of them. On better legislation, the Agency Workers Directive, which will shortly be coming into force, is a disaster for Britain because, in the UK, we have a far more flexible workforce, which is vital to our prosperity and to our recovery. The question is why, when 80% of agency workers are in the UK, the EU should have any role in this legislation at all. The same is true of the dreadful Fund Managers Directive, where again 80% of fund managers are only in the UK. The lesson is this: overregulation destroys jobs, and we need less regulation now. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

– Mr President, I may have changed my seat here to the ECR Group this week, but I have not changed my perspective on the European Union. When it comes to Schengen, it has been the ECR view that this is generally a matter for Schengen area members to decide, including Switzerland, of course, which is in Schengen, but not in the European Union. But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis. Pragmatism dictates that the implications of Bulgaria and Romania joining are profound for those way beyond the Schengen area. A leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the UK can reach Calais without hindrance, for example, and Bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime. In summary, this proposal is simply a border too far. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, Europe Day this week was supposed to be a celebration of European national identity. It is not. It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government, meaning above nation states. This is in contrast to intergovernmental, where nation states freely cooperate, but do not cede powers to a higher central authority. The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference. The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain, France and the United States, whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons. The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation. In contrast, the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron’s proposal for a no-fly zone. It is ironic that the Red Baroness herself, Cathy Ashton, stood against this no-fly proposal, her aide reportedly calling it ‘headline grabbing desperation’. The lesson of this is that principal nations act intergovernmentally while supranational bodies merely fiddle as Libya burns.

– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others. Therefore, UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments, but voted a resounding ‘No’ to the report as a whole. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

– Mr President, in Britain, the first day of April is called April Fool’s Day and people take great delight in fooling one another. So when some report that Iceland is on course to join the EU next year, I think: ‘April Fool!’ In reality, a survey has shown that 64% of Icelanders want to remain independent, only 24% want to carry on applying for EU membership and, indeed, 60% of Icelandic businesses are against it. It is also said that Iceland wants the security of the euro. April Fool! Even Portugal’s own banks are currently refusing to buy Portuguese bonds. Iceland will neither give up its rich fishing grounds – producing 40% of its exports – to join the disastrous common fisheries policy, nor abandon an Icelandic Parliament that is more than 1 000 years old and the winner of a UNESCO award for democracy. Even with a banking hangover, Iceland, like Britain, remains better off outside. No fooling there! David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, whilst good Libyan people are being bombed and terrorised by Mr Gaddafi, the EU has been shelling out on projects for Libya like ‘enhancing respect for international humanitarian law’. It is pretty obvious that has not worked. Meanwhile, Baroness Ashton here is demanding yet more resources, on top of the almost EUR 3 billion the External Action Service is due to receive. Instead of being immersed further in this bloated, duplicating and insatiable EU foreign service and European Defence Agency, Britain should spend the GBP 48 million a day we pay for EU membership on our own national defence interests. The Libyan crisis has shown the value of having aircraft carriers with fast jets stationed off crisis zones. I appeal to David Cameron to see sense and reprieve both the carrier HMS Ark Royal, and at least a minimum number of Harriers. During the Falklands crisis, Mrs Thatcher successfully reprieved the Ark’s sister ship, HMS Invincible. We must do the same for the Ark Royal. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

 UKIP wants the UK to leave the European Union and retain friendly trading links through a UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, similar to that with non-EU Switzerland and Norway. I voted in favour of this EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement as it can be a model and a template for a future UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, and because it demonstrates that tariff-free and favourable trading access to the EU can be achieved without the UK (or South Korea) being a member of the EU. This is especially true in the case of the UK, which would be the EU’s largest single trading partner. A UK-EU Free Trade Agreement would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the UK as a member of the EU, and would therefore require far less negotiation (e.g. over tariff reductions) than did the agreement with South Korea.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service. The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK. We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception.

 The UK Independence Party fully supports the cause of genuine human rights. However, we note that the EU’s interpretation of human rights is a flawed one.

 Madam President, this banana is the stuff of war – an EU-inspired trade war with America that has lasted 16 years and has now been lost spectacularly. The EU has now been fined nearly USD 200 million by the World Trade Organisation and been forced to drop its illegal tariffs – all because of the protectionism that lies at the heart of the EU, in this case protection of French colonies. May I say that this very banana which I bought today in the European Parliament supermarket is illegal! It does not conform to EU rules in terms of the length, the width and the straightness of bananas. What is going on? With such barmy protectionism and such silly rules as this, one has to ask: is the European Union crazy or has it merely gone bananas? David Campbell Bannerman,

 – Madam President, in discussing the Black Sea area, one word leaps to mind, and that is ‘caution’. All must tread carefully here. The Black Sea area is Russia’s backyard. It has its fleet anchored in the Crimea at Sebastopol, close to the bloody battlefields of the Crimean War. We have seen the unfortunate conflict in Georgia, where there was fault on both sides. Had Georgia been in NATO, the consequences could have been disastrous. Whilst I support Georgian independence, it is unwise to goad the Russian bear in its own lair. Then there is Turkey which the EU is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as France will veto an application. Turkey has just 4% of its landmass within Europe. It should not be in the EU. There are real dangers in leading Turkey on. Disappointment could drive Turkey into the hands of Islamic extremists. Finally, underlying all of this is the fact that the Black Sea is the hub for vital Caspian oil and gas. Tread carefully indeed. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, back in 2007, President Sarkozy denied any link between the release of five Bulgarian nurses from Libya and the Libyan order for French missiles worth EUR 240 million. These arms were sold to a country held responsible for the Lockerbie bombing and the supply of terrorist weapons. Yet even Gaddafi’s son suggested that there was a link between the two deals. It was arms for prisoners. In 2004, the EU removed the arms embargo against Libya in exchange for migration controls. That was arms for borders. Now, the London Times reports that Baroness Ashton suddenly wants to drop the EU arms embargo against China, which was imposed because of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, saying it is ‘a major impediment to developing stronger EU-China cooperation’. Actually, I believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro, is it not? Just like the Libyan deal, it seems the EU is so desperate now to save the euro that it is prepared to risk our collective security, as only the Chinese have enough money to rescue the euro. This is arms for bonds. Chinese foreign exchange reserves are USD 2.9 trillion. It has already bought Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds. However, China is also the country that bans the word ‘democracy’ from its search engines and executes thousands every year. So, I ask in all sincerity, just how low will the EU go to save the euro?

 Madam President, whilst we all unite in condemning flagrant human rights abuses in countries such as Iran and China, we must start distinguishing these from the grossly over-the-top EU-inspired human rights industry. The public are now bamboozled by this human rights fest. There is the EU Fundamental Charter of Human Rights in the Treaty of Lisbon; there is a European Court of Human Rights over there, which seeks to give British prisoners the vote – even murderers and paedophiles. There are excessive EU employment rights and American-style rights too for damages, and national legislation such as the UK’s disastrous Human Rights Act, which allows foreign terrorists and criminals to stay in Britain because their rights are now seen to be more important than those of the decent citizens they threaten. The truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough, with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists, criminals and the greedy. This has to stop. David Campbell Bannerman,

 Madam President, thank you for using my full name. I think we should celebrate the fact that NATO’s Lisbon Summit has strengthened protection for our peace and democracy, in direct contrast to the Treaty of Lisbon which is already doing quite the opposite. But NATO is threatened by the savage cuts being imposed on European armed forces. These are deeply dangerous. It is unforgiveable that the UK Government is slashing spending to below the 2% base level every NATO member is meant to honour. It is a false economy too, because defence spending brings good jobs. Today the British Harrier jet is removed from service. This month we lost the carrier HMS Ark Royal prematurely with the loss of 6 000 dedicated personnel. The USA cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us. We should be under no illusion that the Americans could pull out of NATO, as top British General Dannatt has warned, and leave us to an emboldened Russian bear still prepared to launch cyber attacks against Estonia and to systematically probe British sea and air defences, in disturbing echoes of the Cold War.

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, I know Ukraine from visits to Kiev and the Crimea and collect Ukrainian artists such as Tetenko and Shishko. The Ukrainians are a good, generous, warm-hearted people, but politically I would counsel great care. Ukraine is a country divided between a pro-western west and a Russian-facing east. It is also a big player, with 45 million citizens, and Russia sees the country as very much in its backyard. I have toured the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula. The Russians will jealously guard access to the Black Sea from there. Any talk of Ukraine joining NATO would be a sharp kick to the Russian Bear. A clumsy diplomatic approach by Baroness Ashton could exacerbate tensions at a difficult time, whilst the cost of forcing Ukraine into the EU in terms of farming subsidies, regional aid and mass migration would be prohibitive.

 UKIP accepts there are legitimate arguments about the death penalty, both for and against. However, UKIP feels that the decision to have or not have the death penalty is a decision that lies only with the individual nation state, and not the undemocratic EU. UKIP notes the attempts the EU has made to interfere with other countries’ policies in this area. It is not for the EU to bully any country into maintaining abolition or enacting abolition of the death penalty. UKIP also notes the way the EU has shut down any debate on this topic in the European context, despite public opinion on the subject. The maintenance or otherwise of the death penalty is, and should remain, a decision solely made at the nation state level via democratic means. Any state with the death penalty should ensure proper procedures of evidence collection, prisoner interrogation and fair trials.

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it.

– Mr President, the EU’s interest in the export of arms is clearly part of the increasing militarisation of the EU in the post-Lisbon era. Tony Blair himself told journalists just days ago that he wanted to see the EU develop a ‘military character’. A big part of this will be who the EU gets its weapons from and who it sells those weapons to. There is already talk that equipment produced for the EU army will not be interoperable with American equipment. The crazy notion of the British sharing an aircraft carrier with France would lose Britain access to US stealth technology overnight. It would also close the UK market to American imports and close the US market to British exports, destroying jobs on either side of the Atlantic. Defence exports are worth GBP 7 billion a year to the UK economy, that is the same as we pay to the EU in net contributions every year. We should oppose all such moves. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, there is something much deeper and more significant about the External Action Service, which is rooted in international law about what constitutes a nation state. Under the guiding 1933 Montevideo Convention, which the EU has accepted, there are four separate qualifications for a state: a permanent population, defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into diplomatic relations with other states. The EU already possesses three of these four: a permanent population – the Lisbon Treaty makes us all EU citizens; a defined territory – the EU nations all have clear, defined boundaries; a government – well, UKIP has long argued that this Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the real power, the Commission, are all part of an EU government. That leaves the fourth and final component: the capacity for a nation state to enter into relations with other nation states. I believe that through the Lisbon Treaty, through Baroness Ashton’s role and the External Action Service, the European Union now has all four criteria it needs under international law to declare itself a single nation state – a United States of Europe – and to do so overnight. (Applause from the centre and left)

– Madam President, I do not think any of us can fail to be sympathetic to the people of Kyrgyzstan for the recent suffering they have endured: 2 000 dead in rioting and 400 000 people displaced – mainly from the Uzbek community – placing enormous pressure on Uzbekistan. This is an immense crisis, in the words of the Red Cross. This country is already the poorest and the smallest of the former Soviet republics. It is tragic for a country that aspires so earnestly for parliamentary democracy to be in this kind of state. Indeed, the trigger seemed to have been the constitutional changes that they wished to aspire to. It is also one of the few Muslim nations in the world to be headed up by a woman; let us hope that Iran follows shortly. This lady, Roza Otunbayeva, is the first president of an ex-communist central Asian country – and good for her. All democratic nations should be doing all they can to support an aspiring parliamentary democracy of this sort, but it is swimming in a sea of powerful autocratic neighbours and with the ever-present threat of radical Islam on its borders. This nation is a bulkhead of democracy and deserves our support. I fear it has become a pawn in larger power games. It is now part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which China and Russia use to dominate the Central Asian landmass and whose agenda should be regarded with some suspicion. China and Russia have incentives to destabilise the country to threaten the presence of an American airbase there as well, with covert backing of opposition forces. May I conclude by saying that all democratic nations should support this brave, aspiring but deeply troubled nation. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer Report in the European Parliament because it is a sloppily-drafted dog’s dinner which does not clearly support country of origin labelling for simple foods like meats and eggs. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers selling their goods and for consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from.

– Mr President, I have no doubt that all of us here are in favour of human rights. Indeed, many of these are rooted in the finest traditions of English laws – such as the Magna Carta of 1215, which outlawed arbitrary imprisonment, and the work of the British lawyers who wrote much of the European Convention on Human Rights after the war. But it seems that a worthy agenda of human rights has now been hijacked by greedy lawyers and political opportunists. Over the water from the UK, here in Strasbourg, sits the European Court of Human Rights. Now its Committee of Ministers has ruled that Britain must overturn its ban on allowing prisoners to vote because it violates the human rights of prisoners. But are human rights not meant to protect decent, law-abiding citizens, not terrorists, hijackers, murderers and law-breakers? Is it really any court’s job to ask us, as politicians, to seek votes from the likes of Ian Huntley, the paedophile who murdered two little girls in Soham, in my constituency? Is it justice to seek his approval? Is it right to knock on the cell door of Rose West, a serial killer, securing her support? And what of Abu Qatada, Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe? Who will he be voting for? Possibly the Liberal Democrats, because they support this nonsense! Yet, seriously, these large prison populations could swing marginal votes, especially at the local level. So there should be no equivalence of rights between decent, law-abiding citizens and those of murderers and criminals. They forfeited their right to participate in the political process when they took other people’s lives, other people’s rights and other people’s property. What about the rights of victims? What about human responsibilities rather than just rights? Like the euro, I believe the currency of human rights is rapidly being debased. We need a return to good common sense.

– UKIP do not support cancellation of debt on the basis that it is economically unsound on the following points: 1. A creditor nation is usually a debtor nation. For example, the UK is a significant donor of overseas aid. Yet the UK, and therefore its tax payers, are usually unwilling donors to aid recipients whilst debt mountains pile up for UK plc. 2. Debt cancellation impairs Third World debtor countries from raising further international finance. Therefore, it is not in the debtor nation’s interest. 3. Debt cancellation introduces moral hazard. What of Third World countries which meet debt obligations, of which there are many? 4. Cancellation implicitly condones fraud, corruption and the misappropriation of loans so endemic in African debtor countries. 5. Given the massive debt now of most international economies, who arbitrates where cancellation is appropriate? Further moral hazard. John Bufton  (EFD

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report.

Any amendments that we felt unnecessarily harmed British farmers were not supported, as were any amendments that expanded EU control in this sector. UKIP will continue to defend the interests of British farmers against EU interference, as we feel the British agricultural sector is perfectly capable of running its own affairs, and already has high standards of both quality and safety. UKIP opposes the way CAP has historically been used in corrupt ways (e.g. phantom vineyards) or the way it is used to top-up the income of certain politicians in EU countries who own ‘farms’. UKIP also objects to being forced to subsidise farms in other parts of Europe, which compete with our own farmers. UKIP is committed to trade in agricultural produce, under the terms of WTO rules.

 – Mr President, my French is not very good – pardonnez-moi –
 but I do understand that the French word ‘gouvernement
’ means government in English. I thought that was easy to understand. However, it does not seem to be easy for the British Labour Government or for President Van Rompuy. They seem to think it means governance, which is defined as the action or manner of governing. That is just dissembling, since the reality is that the EU Council’s agreement to improve economic EU gouvernement
 means the action of ruling and directing the affairs of a state. The truth, then, is that the Council has handed yet more powers over to the EU, including powers over the UK economy, which is the single most important issue to the British people today. When will people be told the truth? We are heading for an EU superstate, and Britain will have to pay to rescue those in the euro area – even though it is not, thankfully, a member of the euro itself.

– Mr President, Amendment 1 of this housing resolution proposes to extend use of the European Regional Development Fund to all Member States, not just those joining in 2004. So this is directly relevant to Britain. It is clear from the resolution that the Roma population is the largest marginalised community in the report receiving support, plus others of similar socio-economic condition. The overall budget for the European cohesion policy is a staggering EUR 347 billion over seven years – larger than many economies, even. My constituents in East Anglia are already deeply concerned at the scale of the traveller and gypsy communities, particularly so in Essex. They will be angry should any of these measures facilitate yet more EU mass immigration. Britain has already seen a rise in population of three and a half million – half the size of London – in the 12 years since the Labour Government came to power in 1997. Given, too, that nearly nine out of ten new British homes – 86% – will be due to immigration over the next 30 years, proposals like these seem to be yet another bridgehead for major immigration into Britain. We do not have the room. It is about space, not race. Controlled immigration through permits and visas is a good thing, but uncontrolled immigration is a bad thing, for that is the fast route to extremism, which none of us desire.

– Madam President, in my English constituency this week, it was discovered that scientists from the University of East Anglia were allegedly manipulating data to try and prove man-made global warming. What a giveaway that was! It is clear now that the scientific consensus on man-made global warming is fast eroding: 30 000 sceptical scientists in the Manhattan Declaration; 600 scientists in a US Senate report; even German scientists this year writing to Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, the author of the key UN report on this, Sir Nicholas Stern, urges us to become vegetarian to stop cows farting. Maybe it is not just certain cows that have gone mad. I am on the Committee on International Trade. I am deeply concerned with the WTO talks starting this week. I worry about a drift towards green tariffs justified on the basis of such spurious claims. These new tariffs are just barriers to trade, they punish the poor and have no justification whatsoever. This is just enviro-imperialism. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate. The wicked Lisbon constitution already forces an unelected President and Foreign Minister on us all. Now this report adds a new European diplomatic service, the so-called European External Action Service, but embassies represent national interests. So what national interests will these new EU diplomats and embassies represent? They will not be those of our nation states, our trade or our companies. They will be those of the European Commission. All other national embassies will become redundant. Already, British embassies around the world are selling off properties. This master plan for an EU superstate is built on foundations of deceit, dishonesty and denial, but federalists are not creating a new United States of America. They are creating a new Yugoslavia. By forcing very different nations, cultures and economies together under a rigid, undemocratic Soviet-style bureaucracy, you are entering very dangerous waters indeed. I worked for the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process. I saw what happened when democracy fails. It is not pretty. Now I see democracy failing here in Europe. You profess to love peace but, by railroading through Lisbon and by this power grab of our embassies, you are putting Europe firmly back on the road towards war once again.

− We acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, particularly for beef and sheep farmers in the South and East of England who, by wholesale vaccination on their own farms, have created a firewall against bluetongue that their fellow farmers in the North and West have benefited from. In order to vote for EU funding for this vaccine we are obliged (in the same vote) to vote for increased funding for Eurojust and Europol. These are two agencies that operate outside the boundaries acceptable to British law, severely increasing the power of the state at the expense of the liberty of the individual. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, we could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains our voting abstention on the subject. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this is my first, or maiden, speech in this Parliament. As a UKIP MEP for the East of England, you will expect me to be a rebel and I will try not to disappoint you or my voters. We are discussing today EU trade agreements and, in particular, that with South Korea, due to be signed this year. As we do not have much of the detail on this particular agreement, other than the fact, I believe, that two thirds of the benefits will accrue to South Korea and one third to the EU, I would like to make some more general points. Many people are not aware that there are over a hundred separate bilateral EU trade agreements like this one; 116 is one estimate. There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa. In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein. There are also trade agreements with non-EU EEA and EFTA countries such as Switzerland and Norway. Norway’s trade agreement religiously protects both its fishing and farming, and Norway is not a minnow. It is the EU’s fourth largest import partner and sixth largest export market. What should a trade agreement like South Korea’s really contain, then? Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example. There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products. There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland. There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area. The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU’s film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants. There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters. In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost. It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access, but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion, a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year. Nor is Switzerland an insignificant trading partner either: 80% of Swiss exports go to the EU, and it is the EU’s fourth largest trading partner. My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources. Even the Commission website admits ‘Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings. It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.’ How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers’ Directive or the new Fund Managers’ Directive! So I conclude in asking, why not Britain? Why cannot Britain have a similar, friendly trade agreement with the EU like South Korea instead of full EU membership? Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year. We, too, can have the kind of assurances the Swiss enjoy. We could, and I believe we should, be an independent free trading nation once again such as Norway, Switzerland and even South Korea. John Bufton  (EFD

This summit sees us discuss, once again, the EU’s Youth Employment Initiative, its place within wider efforts to foster growth, jobs and EU competitiveness, and the aim of making it fully operational by January 2014. The UK currently has a youth unemployment rate of 21 %. This means that approximately 1 million 18-25 year olds in the country are out of work. And, as of 1 January 2014, when 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians will be allowed to enter the country freely, the youth job market – and, more than likely, the job market as a whole – is sure to reach saturation point. We can sit here and discuss and dissect the Youth Employment Initiative all day and all night but my party and I quite simply cannot see how this initiative will make any real positive impact in our country. It is clear to me that the only way to ease the youth employment crisis we are currently facing in the UK is to leave the EU, regain proper control of our borders and make sure that any available jobs are done by our own young people.

According to the EU treaties, abortion is a matter of sovereign competence for the Member States, yet this report attempts to interfere with and override that fact. Furthermore, it is a fundamental part of human rights that parents should have the freedom to bring up their children according to their own choices and moral beliefs – enforcing compulsory sex education across the EU, as outlined in this report, is contrary to this right.

Firstly, it is important to emphasise that the UK is not part of this scheme. Moreover, we are against this directive as it supports a proposal, in the area of gathering and exchanging information on border security, which will give the Commission further power over immigration control.

I voted against this proposal as my party believes that the existing Batteries Directive prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated in devices or products, which contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight, with exceptions for certain categories of products.

This is an important issue, which should be covered by national legislation rather than by the EU. Ideally it should be possible to introduce and support practical anti-discriminatory measures.

This is another example of how citizens are fed up and disappointed with the EU: often, complainants resort to these petitions simply because it is seen as a way to protest.

I am against this directive because the UK already faces a number of immigration and healthcare challenges which would only increase if the directive were to be adopted. On the one hand, introducing a virtual professional qualifications card that would make it easier for European healthcare professionals to move and practice in other EU countries would cause a brain drain in some European countries that are in dire need of qualified healthcare professionals. On the other hand, it would increase the difficulties in already challenged labour markets in countries such as the UK, which are struggling to support local workers while dealing with an influx of legal and illegal immigration.

I prefer not to give our consent to such agreements, particularly as we have our own immigration policies in the UK and do not want EU involvement in such legislative concerns.

I believe that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade block in order to sign trade agreements.

My party has made it very clear from the outset that we oppose all aspects of this Directive. No-one can dispute that smoking is a major health issue that affects the whole of Europe. Indeed we have all seen the statistics – that over 700 000 people a year in Europe die of smoking. However shocking this figure is, though, it is ultimately these people’s right to smoke – and the EU certainly does not have the right to try and stop them. Ironically, the measures outlined in the Directive are flawed on so many levels that they are unlikely to stop people smoking anyway. Banning smalls packs will simply make people buy more cigarettes. Banning menthol and other flavoured cigarettes will simply increase the cigarette black market. Demanding that large health warnings be put on cigarette packs will make counterfeiting easier, fuelling the black market yet further.

I must laud the Commission Presidentʼs attempt to put a positive spin on the current State of the Union, however, I quite simply fail to buy into his over optimistic and ideological view. And I am sure I am not the only one. Europe is, in reality, nowhere near an economic recovery – fragile or otherwise. And this incessant pursuit of forming a Europe-wide banking union is unlikely to aid recovery. It is, if anything, more likely to lead Europe into an even deeper financial mess. Similarly, his suggestion that we continue to work in the same way to alleviate unemployment levels in the EU is simply absurd. One look at the figures tells us that the schemes and systems implemented to date have been ineffective – and yet he insists on forcing the Member States to continue down this road to ruin. To end on a positive note, although it is unusual for the Commission President to express opinions about the internal political situation in a Member State, I welcome his acknowledgement that UKIP is fast becoming a real fighting force in UK politics. The real brand of euro-scepticism that our party offers is finally receiving the recognition it deserves. John Bufton  (EFD

As a responsible politician and an accountant it is impossible for me to approve this discharge Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the discharge of the Railway Agency in particular because of the wastefulness of its two headquarters in Lille and Valenciennes, two cities that are 50 kilometres apart.

 Mr President, when I was European Commission Chief Accountant back in 2002, I pointed out huge flaws in the accounting systems. Today it is still just as bad – or even worse – than it was back then. Yet MEPs will grant discharge to the budget, despite a hole of EUR[nbsp ]6.2 billion in the accounts. It is now clear to me that the discharge procedure is a pantomime. There is no longer proper scrutiny or any holding to account for taxpayers’ money by MEPs. What an anomaly! Those who approve the budget are the same voices asking for budget increases, year after year, for the same Member States they blame for the irregularities. We should instead be cutting the EU budget by a minimum of the same level of the error. In May, taxpayers should call to account all the MEPs who approve of this ludicrous situation. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 Madam President, it is that time of the year again when we put forward our wishes regarding what the EU budget should be spent on. Headlines like ‘investing in research and innovation’, ‘strengthening EU industry’ or ‘job creation’ are repeated year after year. We are supposed to have been investing in those areas for the last decade. It has made no difference, as the crisis has demonstrated, and yet the Commission keeps asking for more money. This is in spite of the fact that the auditors say that the level of irregularities has increased. As I see it, the Commission has totally failed to demonstrate any efficiency in controlling taxpayers’ money. Would anybody in their right mind invest in such a badly-run organisation? The answer would certainly be no. So why do we keep asking for more money from taxpayers? It is this Parliament’s role to call the Commission to account and say ‘no’ to business as usual.

 I voted against the Karas/Hoang Ngoc report on the role and operations of the Troika with regard to the euro area programme countries because it wants to create an EU European monetary fund which I would consider to be a disaster for the taxpayers of the Member States. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the Gardiazabal Rubial report on the General guidelines for the 2015 budget – Section III. The guidelines as always seek to increase the EU budget and turn a blind eye to the continuing high level of irregularities in the budget. In 2012 these were 4.8% of the budget. In addition the Court of Auditors has not approved the EU books for the nineteenth consecutive year. The EU budget exists to make the EU relevant to the citizens of Member States but in the light of the EU’s continuing role in the financial crisis, even it is not enough to make the citizens want to continue with the project.

 I voted against the Iacolino report on the European Public Prosecutorʼs Office (EPPO) because while I fully support the fight against fraud in the EUʼs budget, the establishment of the EPPO would fundamentally encroach upon the sovereignty of national criminal justice systems.

 I voted against the Daerden report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Comunidad Valenciana textiles.

 I voted against the Zuber report on equality between women and men in the European Union because, yet again, European federalists are using the natural human instinct of fairness to extend the EU’s remit into areas where the European Union has not been given competence.

 I voted for the Casini report Amending Rules 166 (final vote) and 195(3) (voting in committee) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure.

 I voted against the Costello Report on the Fund for European aid to the most deprived. Our government strongly supports measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion. But it does not believe that the Fund for European aid to the most deprived will be an effective way of doing this. We were one of a number of Member States which argued that this was an area of national competence and we have not participated in the previous food-bank schemes since the mid-1990s. Both Houses of Parliament have adopted Reasoned Opinions stating that the Commissionʼs proposal is inconsistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the De Backer Report on the European Semester. While the report is in the main part acceptable and supports Conservative priorities such as structural reforms, tax simplification and a stronger single market in services, there are too many concessions made to the Left.

 I voted against this report because it fails in its stated aims. Decreasing the length of delay after which compensation can be claimed from five to three hours would incentivise airlines to cancel flights in order to maintain their schedule and minimise compensation. Secondly, it would put a disproportionate burden on feeder flights. If adopted, these proposals would lead to a reduction in services (particularly from the regions) and would threaten ‘inter-lining’, thus increasing journey times and requiring passengers to check baggage in and out for ‘connecting flights’. In addition, the proposals would not remove a clause suspending the application of air-passenger-rights legislation to Gibraltar. In 2006, the UK, Spain and the Government of Gibraltar concluded the ‘Cordoba Agreement’ to ensure that Gibraltar Airport was part of the EU’s single market. I share the UK Government’s strong view that Gibraltar is an EU airport and that, in line with the Treaties, all EU aviation measures must be extended to Gibraltar. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against this report because our energy market must be free from the burden of expensive renewable energy quotas. I cannot support this joint committee report calling for the continuation of the 2020 binding targets on emissions reduction and renewables, as well as a mandatory target for energy efficiency.

We cannot afford to continue to make the same mistakes that have pushed our energy costs to such a high level. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted for the oral question on female genital mutilation (FGM), asking the Commission about its intentions to propose a strategy and action plan aimed at addressing FGM. Although I do not want to see an EU legislative instrument, I would like to see more coherent policy, detailing how Member States can tackle this brutality. In particular, I would like to see Member States pursuing, prosecuting and punishing any EU resident who has carried out FGM, and I would like to see them recognise that FGM is a gross form of violence against women and violence against the child. (According to the World Health Organisation, the majority of cases of FGM have involved young girls between infancy and the age of 15.) Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 The EMPL and ECON committees wanted to initiate consultation with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) on the subject of the structure and organisation of social dialogue in the context of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

 This agreement with the Swiss competition authorities is largely straightforward and reflects the high level of integration between the EU and Swiss economies.

 This report addresses perceived difficulties caused by differing rules and requirements across the Member States relating to official documents such as birth certificates and residency permits. Presently most Member States require documents to be authenticated, either through legalisation or apostille procedures, where documents have been issued in another country, including other Member States. However, the rapporteur has chosen to increase significantly the scope of the legislation, whilst Tory amendments to introduce greater safeguards against fraud and forgery were rejected. As a consequence I voted against this proposal. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 This directive updates the 2003 Market Abuse Directive by introducing maximum jail sentences of at least four years for market abuse, such as insider dealing, market manipulation and unlawful disclosure of information. It complements the regulation adopted last year which imposed large fines on companies involved in such practices. It should be noted that while the UK already imposes more severe criminal sanctions than required by the proposal, it has an opt-out on this legislation under Protocol 21. Nevertheless, as many Member States have hitherto imposed less severe penalties in this area, I voted in favour of the report to reduce the number of cases of market abusers taking advantage of lax jurisdictions.

 This regulation has been resubmitted to Parliament due to an incorrect legal basis being used in the original proposal. A notification mechanism will be put in place for Member States to provide the Commission with certain data and information regarding investment projects in energy infrastructure that concern the production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas and electricity. I voted in favour of this report as it will help to build a better understanding of the EU’s energy infrastructure, which will be particularly important when reviewing and planning energy security policies.

 Part of this report is dedicated to the procedure on the appointment of the Court of Auditors’ members and consultation with Parliament. It is stressed that some appointments to the Court have given rise to differences between Parliament and the Council, and it is considered unacceptable that the Council appoints members to the Court of Auditors despite Parliament’s unfavourable opinion. Here, I support the current application of Article 286 TFEU, whereby the Council has the right to adopt candidates for the Court of Auditors after consulting the European Parliament. I defend the Council’s right to override a negative opinion by the European Parliament. Consequently I voted against this report. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I am concerned that this report goes way beyond the competence of REGI and deals with questions that ought to fall within the sole competence of ITRE. Moreover, as Parliament has already adopted reports on the role of cohesion policy in implementing EU energy policy and on the implementation of energy efficiency measures under cohesion policy, this report is unnecessary and unhelpful. Beyond this question of competence, the report calls for ambitious strategies and policies for dealing with CO2
 emissions – in particular, the call for further ambitious binding energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. I am firmly opposed to the setting of any such ambitious targets which prioritise renewable energies over other low-carbon alternatives. Moreover, I am strongly opposed to the earmarking of 20 % of ERDF funding in the recent 2014-2020 Common Provisions Regulation for strategies to develop a low-carbon economy. The report is overwhelmingly prescriptive concerning this point. It is for these reasons that I voted against it. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted for the Tarabella Report on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.

I voted against the Caspary Report on access of third-country goods and services to the Unionʼs internal market in public procurement and procedures supporting negotiations on access of Union goods and services to the public procurement markets of third countries. My vote was against the proposed regulation because it could lead to a net reduction in market access and could diminish growth potential at a time when it is needed most. This is the position of a majority of the Member States in the Council. There are significant risks in deploying the proposed instrument as a leveraging tool in trade negotiations as it could leave the EU open to damaging retaliatory measures, losing out on growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets.

I voted for the Macovei Report on the Hercule III programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the European Unionʼs financial interests because the new programme continues to place specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, which are estimated to cost Member States EUR 11 billion per annum. The programme reflects the Commissionʼs legal obligations stemming from agreements with four international tobacco manufacturers. Even though questions do remain regarding the effectiveness of such programmes, in this case efforts must be made to manage the administrative costs of the programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, there is no doubt that smuggling and the counterfeiting of cigarettes are matters of serious concern for us all. The large sums of money lost, which should be going to exchequers across the EU, are significant, and this means that front-line services are not being as well supported as they should be. But let us be honest: the amounts of taxpayers’ money wasted by the EU institutions are also significant. Some 4.8 % of the EU budget in 2012 was spent on regional projects which should never have received the money – a total of EUR 5.5 billion. Only in December did we learn that billions in aid to Gaza and Egypt cannot be properly accounted for, having been spent on out-of-work politicians. And almost every month we receive a new Court of Auditors’ report spelling out more errors and more wasted money. If MEPs are serious about looking after EU financial interests, they should look closer to home as well as to the Hercule III programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Kadenbach report on ‘Eco-innovation - jobs and growth through environmental policyʼ because I believe that what is really needed is to focus on the implementation of existing legislation before proposing fresh regulations.

I voted against the Klute report on payment accounts because while I agree that bank account fees should be clear and comparable and it should be easy to switch accounts, standard bank accounts are primarily a national concern, and this proposal and the report of the committee are too prescriptive.

I voted against the Harkin report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund 2014-2020 because, while it is purportedly designed to show solidarity towards workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, it is not an efficient and systematic instrument to reduce the impact of the economic crisis. It has never functioned properly, it has lived too long already and should be shut down, not extended. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted for the Mitchell report on resilience and disaster-risk reduction (DRR) in developing countries because it focuses on actions to help the most vulnerable, poorest and marginalised populations, which are the most exposed to risks, while on a broader scale targeting fragile and crisis-prone countries.

I voted against the Gardini report on a civil protection mechanism because the budget for the civil protection mechanism will almost double in the next seven years from EUR 189 million to EUR 326.6 million, which I consider unacceptable.

Mr President, this report represents a broken promise. The Commission assured us that they would get errors under control. Instead, they are on the rise again: up from 3.9% in 2011 to 4.8% in 2012. That is over EUR 6 billion of taxpayers’ money that cannot be properly accounted for. Like the vast majority of the public I am disgusted that the Commission is paying lip service to getting their finances in order. However, what really bothers my patience in this House is the ‘business as usual’ mentality, where irregularities are tolerated despite the huge amounts of money involved. The Commission just gets a polite slap on the wrist. In any private enterprise, if almost 5% of the budget was in error, heads would roll and the shareholders would quite rightly demand change at the top. Instead, this Parliament, which blames the Member States for irregularities, is happy to ask for a bigger EU budget, to give to those same Member States. What a contradiction! Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Koppa report on the implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy (based on the Annual Report from the Council to the Union Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy). The report wants greater harmonisation of EU defence policy, pooling of Member States’ budgets to fund military operations – including expanded common costs of EU battlegroups – and permanent structured cooperation. My party has consistently argued for improved EU coordination with NATO rather than the establishment of new EU strategies and expensive institutions within the CSDP framework.

I voted against the budget of the European Union for 2014 because this is taxpayer money that lacks control. Every year there is evidence of gross mismanagement and even fraud, to the point where the books of the Commission have not been signed off by the Auditors for 19 years. The report of the Court of Auditors for 2012 has the level of ‘irregularities’ up to 4.8%. No responsible person can vote for this. In addition, the United Kingdom is a net contributor that has little say over what the money is spent on. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the La Via report on DAB 9/2013. I do not support the method chosen of financing the fund. EUR 519 million was available at the end of 2013 through the ‘global transfer’, a mopping-up procedure that is executed in every budgetary year to reallocate unused funds in the budget, and the ECR believes that the DAB 9/2013 would have been better financed using money from this procedure rather than placing EUR 150m in the budget for 2014.

I voted in favour of the De Haene-Kalfin report on the MFF because it is in fact the first time that a reduction in the multiannual budget has taken place. This is in large measure due to the tough position the leader of my party, Mr Cameron, took in the Council negotiations on the MFF last year.

I voted against the Takkula report on the establishing of the programme ‘Europe for the Citizens’ for the period 2014-2020 as it is unnecessary and it does not provide value for taxpayers’ money and because we do not support the principal objectives of ‘contributing to citizens’ understanding of the Union, its history and diversity’ and ‘fostering European citizenship’ while ‘improving conditions for civic and democratic participation at Union level’.

I always oppose any handout of extra cash to the European Commission. However, in the case of Amending Budget Number 6, which was voted today to make up for shortfalls in Excise and VAT resources, I abstained, given that we were informed by HM Treasury that the recalculation resulted in a reduction to the British contribution.

 Mr President, during my time as an MEP, this House has come every year, without exception, with a request to increase the EU budget and this, regardless of the current crisis and the austerity measures. Every year too, without fail, the Auditors have refused to approve the management of those EU funds. The problem is one of failure: failure to control that the taxpayers’ money is properly spent. As recently as July, the Court of Auditors reported EUR 3 billion of waste in road construction projects. This audit only covered four countries so I fear that the overall figure across the EU would be much higher. If we did a proper job we would not need to engage in a multi-million information campaign ahead of the 2014 elections. EU taxpayers do not trust us because we do not look after their interests; we should stop putting more money into this black hole. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, at long last the saga that was the negotiation of the EU long-term budget, the MFF, has concluded. This House backed away from the frankly ridiculous EUR 1 trillion that it had been asking. We agree that EUR 960 billion is still a massive figure but it represents, for the first time since multiannual budgeting began in 1993, a reduction in the EU budget. This is something that, as you will know, I have been asking for since I first became an MEP. But the public will not be rejoicing. They know that the MFF is still full of vanity projects such as Galileo and the ineffective European External Action Service, headed by Catherine Ashton. While today is a step in the right direction, I fear that Parliament will, as in previous years, return like Oliver Twist to ask for more money. I hope flexibility does not mean a blank cheque book. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

Mr President, if anyone needed evidence of how inefficient the EU institutions are, then the seven years it has taken to finalise a revision of the OLAF regulatory framework is surely proof enough. It seems that even when agreement has been reached among institutions there is need for further amendments.  However, the most important issue here today is the independence of OLAF, which this framework actually fails to put right. The Anti-Fraud Office is primarily aimed at avoiding fraud and corruption affecting EU funds. It should there be, by its very definition, independent of the institutions involved in handling those funds – notably the European Commission, but also the European Parliament and the European Council. OLAF should report directly, without EU intermediaries, to the European citizens who fund the EU budget, and its regulation must not be subject to any politics. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, no one denies that well-funded companies and wealthy investors may be trying to avoid tax. The tax avoiders are mostly in Europe, America or other developed countries. However, when we talk about tax havens, they are mostly in small jurisdictions outside of those countries. This report is really a request for the EU to start controlling tax policy over which it has no competence. Tax is the competence of national governments in the EU and elsewhere. The truth is that clamping down on tax havens requires agreement between all the governments involved; otherwise, it is a pointless exercise. In any case we already have the OECD’s Financial Action Task Force working on this. Europe just wants to get its hands on what is at present a sovereign matter for the nations of Europe. One cannot help thinking that this is exactly what they wanted in the first place. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, once again we are being asked whether or not we approve the management of EU funds by the European Commission. The Court of Auditors has, for the 18th year in a row, refused to clear the EU budget, but this has never led this Parliament to actually act. When the auditors talk about significant material errors, breach of public procurement rules, claims for non-existent animals and incorrect activation of entitlements, they are actually describing the way in which European taxpayers’ money is being misappropriated. The level of irregularities has actually gone up to almost 4%, so the question here is: when is the European Commission actually going to be held to account for this abominable failure? Because whatever blame we want to put on the beneficiaries, it is actually the Commission which asks for our taxes to fund the budgets and which should therefore ensure they are properly spent before releasing them. I am not holding my breath. This Parliament will vote to approve the EU accounts once again. However, the UK and the Netherlands have refused to approve them and I hope many more Member States will follow suit. Marta Andreasenon,  
on behalf of the ECR Group

 Mr President, this House should be the first to lead by example and cut our own costs in line with the austerity measures being imposed around Europe. While I recognise that Parliament’s administration has made an effort to achieve some reductions, there are still many areas where more could and should be done. The most obvious is the ‘three seat’ cost of Parliament. Why not cut out this complex arrangement, for which taxpayers pay more than EUR 250 million per year? The proposed budget includes another significant increase for European political parties – an expenditure line which will have grown by 50% in the last couple of years. What is the purpose of this increase if there will not be a European constituency in the coming elections and Members will be elected from national lists? Projects like the European House of History or the Parliamentarium also continue to absorb more taxpayers’ money. All these costs will not increase the visibility or the credibility of this institution. It is only the hard work and the integrity of the Members which will convince citizens of the importance of this institution. If we continue to ignore this reality we should not be surprised when few turn out to vote in the next European elections. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, since I became an MEP I have been fighting for a reduction in the EU budget. The economic growth promised by the Lisbon Agenda and financed by the current long-term budget has instead brought economic stagnation. I fully support the deal negotiated by the British Prime Minister at the European Council. It represents the first cut in the EU budget since 1993. I have therefore voted in favour of my group’s MFF resolution which endorses the agreement reached by the prime ministers of the 27 Member States early in February 2013. Like other political groups, the ECR emphasises the need to spend more efficiently, rather than simply spend more. It enshrines sound financial management as the guiding principle of the EU budget. I regard the rejection of the Council agreement by the other groups as a slap in the face of European taxpayers. We should lead by example and share the austerity burden; instead the European Parliament has shown its gluttony. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, I find it ludicrous that this House is trying to push ahead on the negotiation of the 2014 budget, on the one hand, while on the other it refuses to back the agreement made by Heads of State on the seven-year budget starting next year. On top of this, the guidelines on the 2014 budget refer to extra payments that need to be covered for past and current years, with the amounts remaining totally unclear. The Commission and Parliament insist on using the word ‘deficit’, whereas this concept does not apply to the EU budget, as revenues are raised from Member States to cover the agreed budget. It is time for Parliament and the Council to call on the Commission to assume its responsibility on the budget and its implementation by providing reliable accounting information as to where and when EU taxpayers’ money is being spent. I am not therefore in a position to vote in favour of the Jensen report. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, the Multiannual Financial Framework has not actually been decided so this debate on 2014 budget guidelines appears to be premature. That aside, and given the economic situation of Europe, I believe it is now time to perform a cost-benefit analysis in regard to the whole of the EU budget. That cost-benefit analysis should start with all the mini-institutions that have been growing like mushrooms in the last decade.  Take for example the EEAS, the European External Action Service. What is the benefit that this institution brings to European citizens? Baroness Ashton has said that it will not replace national embassies. Great! So why do we need it? And the Committee of the Regions, has it actually helped regions develop their economies. No, it does not seem so. If the EU really wanted to help Member States and taxpayers, it would simply abandon budget lines that have no added value – but this will not happen. We will only continue to spend our time trying to window-dress little cuts here and there. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, I must admit that my curiosity was raised by this report. Contrary to its normal strategy of centralising and seizing control as much as possible, the EU is now proposing that banks and investment firms assess for themselves the credit risk of entities or instruments in which they invest, and is asking them not to rely on external ratings. The report even proposes to take ratings out of the Financial Regulation and eliminate risk-weighting of assets through external rating or internal models.  How this would contribute to making the evaluation of risk independent or avoid conflicts of interests, is really a mystery to me. Whether we like it or not, these agencies provide an independent view, and the fact that some would find that they have become too powerful is no basis for them being muscled out in such a way. It is as if the EU wants to remove any analytical road blocks that stand in its way. I wonder why. In response to Mrs Lulling, I would like to say yes, the UK should leave the EU. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, the negotiation of the annual EU budget has become a farce. Last year Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed up to an increase of just over 2 % for 2012. Yet last October the Commission was asking for no less than EUR 9 billion of extra cash and this House has joined the cry for more money. This is a 9 % increase, not a 2 % increase.  Of course last year’s agreement allowed for an increase in the legal obligations the EU could enter into, the so-called commitments. But this fact seemed to go unnoticed by the Heads of State. The fact is that we face the same situation for 2013, as the legal obligations are now growing by up to EUR 151 billion and who picks up the tab? The taxpayers. Frontline services are being cut in Member States while the EU gets on with its own wasteful agenda.  Mr Cameron, please do not come back claiming victory this time. It would be a serious insult to your people.  (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I think that this is not the main issue. The main issue is where we are spending money. You are now running a political campaign against Mr Farage, but that is up to you. I can tell you that I have been involved in the fisheries reform. I presented to this Parliament a report on what the Auditors have said about the common fisheries policy and all of you voted against my report. I do not think you are very concerned about the common fisheries policy at all. Why should Mr Farage be so concerned? Marta Andreasen,

Mr President, it is no surprise that only ten Member States at most are willing to adopt a financial transaction tax. The majority of states know that this tax would only push the financial sector out of Europe, to the further detriment of their economies. Insisting on forcing this tax through by means of enhanced cooperation will only make it more evident that it is the wrong way to go. The ill-fated Swedish initiative back in the 1980s should be seen as a good reason for not proceeding. In addition, there are two aspects of the proposal that have not been laid out in clear terms and which are a matter of concern. The first and most important one is how it will affect non-participating Member States – because it will, notably in the case of cross-border transactions. The second one is how this FTT will be spent.  Regardless, I hope that the British Prime Minister will protect the City from any implications of this tax. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, this is now shamefully the 18th year in a row that the auditors cannot clear the EU budget. Worse, 50 % of the samples taken by the auditors show irregularities. The excuses the Commission puts forward are always the same: it is the fault of the Member States: they commit the irregularities. But taxpayers entrust their monies to the European Commission, which abjectly fails to perform essential controls before it hands the cash over to the Member States. This House is also to blame by continually rubber-stamping the EU budget on the basis that ‘error’ does not necessarily mean ‘fraud’. Well, if a farmer gets money for the welfare of his 150 sheep and the auditors find that he does not have any, in the real world this would be considered fraud. The point is that if the Commission refuses to take responsibility for taxpayers’ money and blames Member States, why does it ask for more money to fund those same Member States? This is yet another reason why the EU budget should be cut. What are we waiting for? Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, what has happened with EU budget investment in the last seven years? Well, we all know where we stand today. Budgeting is not a field where the EU can claim success. Why are we putting more money into agricultural funding that amounts, at present, to over 40 % of the budget? We are paying for farmers not to grow food, although the market is there. Have the billions paid out in structural funds to countries like Greece, Portugal or Spain stemmed the crisis there? No, they have not. If there was a serious will to use the budget to develop Europe’s economy, a major rethink would have taken place many years ago. Instead, every year we are asked to top up the same old budget lines. The EU budget for the 2014-2020 period should be reduced drastically to allow Member States to decide where they want to put their taxpayers’ money. The UK should not only veto an increase, but should demand a significant reduction. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is no secret to anybody that the conciliation for 2013 failed before it even started. This was due to the fact that the Commission came up with a request for EUR 9 billion more to cover this year’s payments. I have been deeply sceptical about the need for this extra cash. Most Member States cannot afford cofinancing in these times of crisis. We need to remember that in February this year, two months after the close of the 2011 accounts, the Budget Commissioner told us that there was a shortfall of EUR 11 billion. Then in April, two months later, he told us there was a EUR 1.5 billion surplus. Then, at the conciliation last week, Mr Lewandowski came up with a reduction on payment needs for 2012 of EUR 1.5 billion. So which number should we believe now? This behaviour has seriously affected the credibility of the negotiators, notably the Commission. No more money should be granted to the Commission as long as it fails to produce reliable and precise information. I have been saying this for many years now.

– The only compromise that the Council and the Member States assumed was the number that was agreed upon last December for the 2012 budget. The fact that the Council said that they would put in more money if it was needed refers to unexpected events, such as the flooding in Italy. However, coming up with EUR 9 billion, which is almost 7 % of the budget for 2012, is really unacceptable and shows that there is no accounting that can be relied upon in the Commission.

– I believe, Mr Garriga Polledo, that we should have proof that the projects have effectively been run. For me, that would be the evidence that we need the money. I am sorry to say this, but we do not have a need popping up from one day to the next which justifies the EUR 9 billion. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteur, we should call this report what it really is: a cry for help by the European Parliament to remain relevant. The lesson still has not been learnt. We find ourselves in the current financial mess in large part due to the inefficiency of the European institutions. Angela Merkel recognised this by deciding to act intergovernmentally instead of interinstitutionally, during all the peaks of the crisis. Now we are being asked to empower the same institutions to be the supervisors of this new European Monetary Union, which will also result in an additional burden to taxpayers. In a nutshell, this will entail more staff and even more money and will further remove powers from national supervisors, while the main problems remain unresolved. The EU needs to learn to do much less and do it better. More Europe simply makes a deep hole much deeper. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, Erasmus started 25 years ago, and three million people have taken part. During the period 2007-2013 the EU has paid out grants worth EUR 3 billion on Erasmus. However, the economy has shrunk and youth unemployment has grown massively to 11.7 %. Furthermore, the grant gives an average EUR 300 per month, which is insufficient to cover the basic costs of living. If we add travel costs to this we can estimate that a family needs to pay at least EUR 5 000 per year on top of the grant to cover the total cost of one of its members doing Erasmus. How many families can afford this in these times of crisis? Considering the lack of impact on employment and economic growth that the Erasmus programme has had over the last decade, and given that it can only be afforded by those that are well off, we should scrap it. There are many other priorities that need more urgent attention. Those who find it indispensable to have this development should pay out of their own pocket instead of imposing the burden on the taxpayer. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, whether it agrees or not, the European Commission has contributed to the crisis by distributing the European budget without exercising proper controls. Also, through multiple directives, it has imposed a huge burden of regulation on Member States, forcing prohibitive costs on private entrepreneurship. How can the same institution which has failed so gravely make judgments on where and how Member States need to put their taxpayers’ money? SMEs are the backbone of economic expansion and recovery. But by urging the Member States to create access to finance for SMEs, we will achieve nothing, as their coffers are now empty. Why not use the bank bailout money to help SMEs instead of helping failed banks? Why not look for more flexible measures instead of calling for the inclusion of a core set of rights in workers’ contracts? The Commission has not learnt any lessons from the past. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this House is stretching the meaning of the word ‘investment’ beyond elasticity. Can any MEP claim that the many billion euros of taxpayers’ money spent on the Lisbon Agenda have delivered any return? Let us look at the evidence. In 2007, EU unemployment was 7.3 %; today it stands at 10.5 %. In Spain, one of the biggest recipients of cohesion funding over recent years, the jobless figure today sits at 25 %. GDP for the European Union has been flat. We should also not forget that the Court of Auditors has not given EU spending an overall clean bill of health for over a decade. The MFF has been built around a legacy of failed projects, and the 2014-2020 MFF simply seeks to top up those failed projects. Employment comes from new industry and new industry requires capital, flexibility and less red tape – none of which the European Union helps with. The MFF needs a haircut and not a Financial Transaction Tax to pay for more waste. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I supported Amendment 1263 on the House of European History because it reduces the budget of the European Parliament by 5.3 million; even though I believe it does not go far enough, it is a reduction. Ideally the vanity project should be wound up and the budget line removed. I voted for Amendment 964 on ITER because I am in favour of reducing the European Union budget, and Amendment 964 was to reduce payments by EUR 490 million. However, I do not support the intent of the author of the amendment which was to eliminate nuclear power. I fully support nuclear power and, if the British people were not sending so much money to Brussels more would be available for investment in the British nuclear industry. I supported Amendment 754 because I oppose EU funds, which are really the taxes of British and European citizens, being used for aid to tobacco producers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Mr President, a 7 % increase for 2013 is outrageous. Does anybody in this House seriously believe that we will help recovery by funding space projects? Why is Galileo still getting EUR 160 million, almost three times more than last year? This is a badly-managed project producing technology that rivals already brought to the market years ago. Why are projects like the Earth monitoring programme and the space research programme getting over EUR 300 million? I can assure you that none of these vanity projects will be putting food on the tables of Europe’s growing number of increasingly angry poor people. Then we have the famous supervisory bodies created a couple of years ago to avoid any more financial scandals. They have not done so. Their reward is EUR 20 million. Would Europe fall apart if all these projects were not funded, along with the EEAS, worth EUR 430 million? Absolutely not. Forget a rise, President; forget a freeze, Mr Cameron. What this ridiculous budget really needs is a cut of at least 10 %. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and legislative resolution because I believe the common fisheries policy cannot be reformed, least of all by its authors (the Commission). It has caused such damage to the industry and to fish that it is irreformable. I believe that power on this policy, as on others, should be returned to the Member States. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I voted against the Färm report because my experience with the management and supervision of European funding is not good. Regional funds which require cofinancing are poorly controlled, with responsibility being shirked by the Commission which is ultimately in charge. Project bonds should be a good means to get private funding for these infrastructure projects, but alas, with the EU managing them, I anticipate poor control and indifferent results. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

in writing. 
– I voted against draft amending budget number 3/2012, the Balzani report, because my party’s policy is to return unused European funds to the Member States and not to put them aside for future use by the European Union. Member States are having difficult budgets at present and are cutting across the board, even frontline services. At times such as these, there is no excuse for these funds being diverted for the questionable projects of the EU. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, here we go again. In the worst financial crisis in living memory, this House comes up with more unrealistic and irresponsible demands. It simply beggars belief that a majority here can even dare to ask for a 6.8% increase. The idea that genuine growth and employment can be delivered by the EU budget is simply ridiculous. Hundreds of billions have been spent to date that have added up to precisely nothing in terms of growth. Many believe, as I do, that the EU and its policies are, to a large extent, responsible for this crisis. The Commission, in particular, has failed to control the use of EU funding entrusted to it by the taxpayers, while targeting the funds towards supporting its own heavy regulation and the EU project as a whole. Now this House wants to reward this failure with an increase. If you are listening, Mr Cameron, I have a straight-talking message for you: continue to send money to Brussels and you are effectively transferring power to an unelected, irresponsible and hugely wasteful bureaucracy. For goodness sake, give the British people a break and cut our contribution to the EU budget. I am calling for a reduction, not for a freeze. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, an astronomical amount of taxpayers’ money has been given to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain by the EU since 2010: EUR 285 billion. You heard me correctly – EUR 285 billion! What has happened to this money? The EU’s failure to keep tabs on funding means that nobody can know for sure. Now, more money is wanted to waste on promoting deeper European integration. The Lisbon Agenda was a disaster. Can anyone here say that Europe is the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world? Only if they are an ostrich. Now the EU wants to pour billions more into the 2020 plan. The new own resources being proposed, namely the financial transaction tax, mean that this money will be even more unaccountable. This House, in approving this framework, is voting for a continuation of the last ten wasteful years. I shudder at that thought. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, Ms Gomes is wrong. She is talking about something different. The EUR 285 billion is the EU budget that was paid into these Member States. This money is not to be returned and it does not earn any interest. Ms Gomes, you are confused. I am not talking about the bailout. I am talking about the EU budget that was supposed to grow the economies of the countries concerned and did not grow those economies. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, these proposals are a classic case of too little and too late. Greece is under the water and Ireland and Portugal are not far behind. But now Spain, a far larger economy, is having to bail out its own banks. Why should private debt be turned into public debt? Whether the money comes from the EU or from national treasuries, the story remains the same. The people who are now suffering from severe belt-tightening will be the ones who end up paying for the wrong decisions made by private companies. What this Parliament should be demanding is a serious investigation into Spain’s banks, notably Bankia, to understand how a hole of EUR 20 billion could suddenly emerge. Bailing out such banks without investigating how and where the money has gone is an act of irresponsibility and contempt towards European citizens. Enough is enough. We need to call time on this approach. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, we are about to allow the EU to finance itself directly from taxpayers’ pockets without negotiations with anybody, not even the Council. We cannot think that giving the EU tax-raising powers without normal democratic scrutiny is acceptable. It is not. In addition, the legal argument on which this House is trying to base the establishment of an FTT is incorrect. The different sizes of the financial industry in some Member States are not an indication of distorted competition, but rather due to historic developmental differences. This should never have been interpreted as a reason for tax harmonisation. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to tax both sides of the transaction. If one of the parties is not a signatory to the treaty, then the other party would have to raise both amounts. What would then happen to the UK veto? It would be useless. The UK taxpayer would end up paying the tax on all transactions that involved Member States who have signed the treaty. However, it would not enjoy a reduction in its EU contribution as it has not signed up to this treaty. Of course, this House and the Commission must know that as long as the FTT does not become a global tax, the financial sector could move to other, more tax-friendly locations. But they feel the EU can afford the loss of this very important industry. It cannot. (The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– Firstly, you would have to prove to me that, in fact, there has not been any relocation away from these countries. I am not sure. I do not have any proof. On the other hand, maybe these countries do not have a similar tax to finance their own budgets. The UK has a stamp duty which it will need to use to finance its own budget. Once this FTT is imposed on the UK, I do not know how the UK is going to finance its budget. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, the procedure whereby we in this House approve the use of the EU budget by the Commission and the other institutions is our greatest responsibility as representatives of the citizens of the Member States. Yet, year after year, while the Court of Auditors fails to give the EU spending a clean bill of health, this House is happy to approve the management’s performance. The auditors’ report for the year 2010 reveals that the error rate – a fine name for the irregular use of funds – has grown from 3.3% to 3.7%. They add that 50% of the transactions sampled were affected by errors. How can we tell taxpayers that their money has been properly spent when we have this situation? Worse, how can we ask taxpayers to put even more into policy areas such as cohesion, energy and transport, where the error rate has increased to an astonishing 7.7%? The increase in the number of agencies from three to 24 in a decade is a matter of concern. The Commission seems to have little control over them, which means that, in the discharge reports, one sees the same stories again and again: conflicts of interest and a revolving door to outside employers at least as efficient as the ones in this building. Yet while this House is prepared to turn a blind eye to the deficiencies of those responsible for most of the budget, including itself, it puts great energy into refusing to approve the management of the Council’s budget. It is not that I want to defend the Council, but this is merely playing politics – and that, in essence, is what the discharge procedure has become, a political game. So, dear taxpayers, nobody actually cares how your money is spent. The solution? Stop sending money to Brussels! Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I am in favour of fusion energy; however, having the EU involved is not the way to achieve it. I voted against the Balzani report on the Draft amending budget no 1 of 2012 because it contributes to the continuation of wasting large amounts of money for a huge, controversial project with a slipping deadline and escalating costs that may never achieve its aim. The ITER agreement was signed in 2006 for a total of EUR 10 billion. It is now already going to cost EUR 15 billion and this figure will probably increase. There is little accountability to taxpayers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I am not against fusion energy. However, when it comes to ITER, the European Commission should have learned from its mistakes. Unfortunately this never happens. For example, the Galileo project was estimated to cost EUR 7 billion in the year 2000; by 2010 the estimated costs had tripled to EUR 22 billion. The cost continues to climb even further with no real end in sight. The parallels are alarming. ITER’s partners are saying they can only build a stripped-down version of the device by 2018, five years later than the date set in the original agreement. The first experiments intended to validate fusion for power will not take place until the end of 2025. Construction costs are likely to double from the original 2006 estimate of EUR 5 billion to EUR 10 billion. The cost of ITER’s operational phase – another EUR 5 billion over 20 years – may also rise. As 90% of the project is directly managed by the participating states, we are unlikely ever to know what the final costs will be. Taxpayers deserve to know the cost of ITER as they are ultimately paying for it, yet this House continues to approve the financing of a project that has already cost over 50% more than the original estimates. The EU’s approach to public finance is catastrophic. On Monday Commissioner Lewandowski told us that the 2011 payments budget was in surplus to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion, yet a couple of months ago he told us it was short to the amount of EUR 11 billion. Which version is true? Does he not know how much money he has in the bank at the end of each day? I know this and everybody knows this. ITER, like Galileo and the EU budget, is becoming an absurdity, but the taxpayers who are left to foot the bill for these projects are not laughing at all, I can assure you. We should scrap this project altogether. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, this Parliament should not be asking for more money from taxpayers, but less. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund a European History House or other narcissistic projects. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund expensive delegation trips to some paradise island. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund synthetic European political parties. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund communication and advertising campaigns to make itself known to the public. What this Parliament needs is to behave responsibly and act genuinely in the interests of the citizens of the Member States. In this sense, the first thing it should do is to stop burdening Europe’s people with heavy and useless regulation that frequently drives them out of business. The second thing it should do is take the lead in avoiding, condemning and sanctioning all wasteful and irregular use of taxpayers’ funds. I will vote against this budget proposal and urge the British Prime Minister to call for a 10% reduction in the EU budget for the European Parliament for 2013. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),

–
 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we already know that billions in taxpayers’ money was wasted in financing the failed Lisbon Agenda, but the EU institutions will never admit their responsibility for helping to create this crisis. Instead, they are asking for more money from EU citizens to finance another failure to come: the 2020 Agenda. This is treating EU citizens as fools. When will this Parliament realise that stimulating growth and jobs requires much less red tape and much less pointless legislation? Why can this Parliament not admit that growth-targeted spending would be best directed at Member State level? Year after year, this Parliament is happy to put more taxpayers’ money in the hands of the Commission, an institution which – as the auditors tell us – is unable to ensure the proper use of EU funding. Of course, the Commission never runs a deficit, and it never will, because it can always go back to the Member States and tax them more to balance its books. If this House refuses to show common sense and responsibility, it will be the architect of its own downfall. I, for one, am calling on the British Government to reduce its contribution to the 2013 EU budget by 10% in comparison with this year’s contribution. However, when it comes to the UK coalition government, I will not be holding my breath. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in the middle of this crisis in which the EU is imposing cuts on Member States, this House still thinks it has the right to ask for inflationary increases. It cannot even agree on what the inflation percentage is but, whether it is 1.9% or 3%, the fact is that this EU bureaucracy is already bloated and needs to go on a hard diet. The cost of this Parliament, which has grown disproportionately, amounts to more than GBP 2 million per MEP. This is not value for money. Entertainment and representation costs have grown by 160% in the last four years. We should do away with this expenditure. The House of European History, with an initial cost estimated in excess of EUR 50 million, and with running costs of more than EUR 11 million per annum, is an extravagance at any time. We should be dropping the whole project. Funding for European political parties and foundations has grown 176% in the last four years. We do not need these European political parties. We MEPs are elected by our constituents or on national party lists. Prime Minister David Cameron is calling for a freeze, but what we need is a significant reduction in this Parliament’s budget and overall, in the whole budget of the European Union, at least a 10% decrease for next year. Without a cut, we are behaving like fat cats. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I voted against this resolution on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) because of economic, legal, environmental and moral reasons. The EU and Morocco concluded a FPA on 22 May 2006. An outside consultancy prepared an ex-post evaluation report, on behalf of the European Commission, which evaluates the first four years of the FPA with Morocco. On a general note, it states that ‘the results of this first four-year period of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco are generally rather disappointing’ as the agreement fails to stabilise the EU market and to develop the fisheries sector. Moreover, the population of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi people who suffer under the unlawful and unacceptable occupation of their country by Morocco, does not benefit from this agreement. Morocco has no right to dispose of the natural resources of a territory which does not fall under its sovereignty. For more than 30 years, the Western Sahara’s problem has been dealt with by the United Nations, but without any progress whatsoever. By rejecting the FPA, the European Parliament sent a strong signal to the Moroccan Government that the EU cannot support an agreement with a country which violates human rights. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the European Parliament and the Commission’s demand for a 5% increase for the 2012 budget was ridiculous, but the Council’s acceptance of a real 2% rise is a slap in the face for taxpayers in Europe. In a doomed pursuit of its Lisbon agenda, the EU has squandered more than one trillion euro of taxpayers’ money. I say the number again: one trillion euro. Funds are given to the Commission which fails to properly control their use, and yet it always comes back to us for more. The present economic and financial situation in Europe is, without a doubt, a reflection of the abject failure in the use of funds. While this wasteful spree goes on in Brussels, Mr Osborne in the UK has announced further budget cuts. So I tell the government in the UK today: no, Mr Hague, the EU budget is not under control; no, Mr Cameron, a 2% rise is not a freeze. For goodness sake, stop sending more British taxpayers’ money to the European Union. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, 31, 32, 33 to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, 25 years ago today I went to a football match along with thousands of Liverpool supporters. Ninety-six of us never came home.

 Madam President, one of the three policy options being discussed as a means of addressing problems around the acquisition and preservation of pension rights is legislation at European Union level. Nothing would alarm my constituency in the West Midlands more than this. The use of best practices in a free and competitive market has always ensured the supremacy of the City of London in the financial services sector. Competition and innovation have ensured that British businesses have always led the way. As the workforce becomes more mobile, it is to innovators – not legislators – that we look to find the answers to the new challenges. Innovation creates; legislation stifles. In any case, the idea of having their pensions legislated by the same people who brought us the eurozone crisis would chill the hearts of most British people. My message to the European Commission is this, to parody an old saying: go and legislate on your own doorstep. Hands off our pensions! Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I commend Ms McIntyre for her efforts in this report and I share with her my desire for greater success for small and medium enterprises, and indeed their ability to create jobs. I think in the UK SMEs create up to about 43% of the workforce, the highest ratio. We differ, however, on how to go about it. She obviously believes that she can achieve this from inside the European Union, in what is probably one of her Conservative Party’s many hopes for reform. I feel this is unlikely. In 2009 when I attended, with Mr Bill Benyon, the Federation for Small Businesses (FSB) hustings in Birmingham, the FSB manifesto said, please, no more legislation from the European Union, please cut the red tape. Ms McIntyre, in the two and a half years you have been here you have failed to cut one piece of red tape. And indeed Mr Rübig, who submitted a question, talks about gold-plating. Well, the UK leads on gold-plating and this Conservative government has not done one thing to cut gold-plating. The Conservative government is losing us jobs in Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question
. –
 Mr President, my question is: with unemployment still a problem across Europe, and indeed in the UK, does Mr Farage think it is a fair use of taxpayers’ money – namely his secretarial allowance – not only to employ his wife Kirsten but also his former mistress, Annabelle Fuller? Is this a responsible use of taxpayers’ money, Mr Farage? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his honesty. As he points out, the EU institutions are responsible for the conditions of the economic adjustment programmes that are bringing hardship and despair to so many people. The EU was ill-prepared and ill-equipped to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. It is young people who are suffering the highest levels of unemployment; there is a decline in job quality and a deterioration in basic labour standards. However, it is not just Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus – the countries that have seen their economic governance fall under the control of the Troika – which are affected. My constituency, the West Midlands, has always been an industrial powerhouse, a centre of innovation and manufacturing excellence, but the eurozone crisis, burdensome EU red tape and the relocation of traditional industries to other EU Member States have left us in a situation where unemployment currently stands at 8.1[nbsp ]%, which is above the UK national average. Some 220[nbsp ]000 people in the region are unemployed. To you, that may be just a statistic, but to 220[nbsp ]000 of my constituents and their families – people with a traditionally strong work ethic – it is a tragedy. It spells frustration; it is a shame; it means young people leaving education but seeing no career, no prospects and no future. The Troika is addressing the symptoms of the crisis but we need to look at the cause. The eurozone is bringing us all down. The good news is that, through hard work and inward investment, the number of people unemployed in the West Midlands is falling. But perhaps the biggest boost to our economy will be when, following a referendum, we free ourselves from the economic basket-case that the EU is becoming. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is anathema to my constituents. It is promoted as a benefit of the EU, yet we see precious little of the money from the fund – which is, after all, UK taxpayers’ money – being returned to us, and when it does come it is much reduced and has strings attached. One ERDF-funded project is the Coventry Arena. In 2003 Coventry City Council received GBP[nbsp ]4.75[nbsp ]million from the fund. Last June I submitted a freedom-of-information request to the council seeking to ascertain the purpose of the grant. At the same time, I submitted an official question to the Commission seeking the same information. Imagine my surprise when the answers did not match. In fact, they could not be further apart. With other information that has come to my attention in the past year, and given Coventry City Council’s constant refusal to meet me about these discrepancies in funding, I can only conclude that they have something to hide. When the Commission sought clarification of the situation, the council changed its position. Today I can confirm that I am referring the matter to the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, so that it can investigate this use of taxpayers’ money. There is something rotten at the heart of Coventry City Council. Is there something fraudulent as well? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I represent the West Midlands in the United Kingdom where we have had terrible weather conditions. This has caused a tremendous amount of damage through floods, namely in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  At the last plenary here in Strasbourg, a Spanish MEP stood up and said he wanted more funds for Spain to deal with weather damage. That is all well and good, but Spain is already a net taker from the European Union. What about my constituents? What about the people in the West Midlands who do not get any of this emergency fund? I am concerned about them. I am concerned about the impact on their lives.  The UK pays GDP[nbsp ]52 million a day to the European Union. When do we get our share back? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, this is a procedural point of order. President Schulz and, I believe, the Conference of Presidents have made it clear that if you are on a speaking list, you cannot have a blue card.

 Madam President, since the Estrela report was voted on in the European Parliament, I have received more correspondence from constituents on this report than almost any other. It is of course a vital policy area that affects us all as individuals and as a society. It is also an area in which certain groups may be particularly vulnerable. This includes those in developing nations, the economically-disadvantaged and the poorly-informed or educated, and those women who live in societies in which women are treated unequally or even regarded simply as property. Through my work on the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, I have witnessed such situations at first hand. There are important debates to be had: access to contraception, sexual health, education and healthcare, and abortion are just some of the issues. It will also come as a surprise to learn that in several countries in the EU the age of consent is as low as fourteen. These debates must include all actors in society – not just politicians, but also healthcare professionals, teachers, parents and, given the moral implications, the Church. The Church should not be made an enemy. The Estrela report, however, appears to be dominated by a political agenda and in my opinion is unacceptable. That is why I could not support it, as I believe this to be a national competence. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, this is the first point of order: when an MEP asks for a procedural point of order, the President must give way. I think this is in the Rules of Procedure, and you failed to do that. I am actually calling for you to suspend this debate and put in place a chair who can competently take this debate. This has been absolute chaos. Your absolute bigoted bias in this debate has been absolutely disgraceful. Please vacate the chair and put someone else more competent in. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is poignant that Greece should take over the Presidency at this time. Greece is the living embodiment of the failure of the Troika and indeed the euro project. Mr Samaras, you talk about the mistakes of your country over decades. Surprisingly, you failed to put any blame where it truly belongs, namely on the pro-federalising Eurocrats who ignore the Maastricht convergence criteria to push on with their project of a federal Euro-state. Linking the Greek economy with such a powerhouse as Germany was utter madness, and your people paid the price – not least with a suicide rate that increased by 46 %. In your speech you stated that your first commitment was to ever-closer EU integration. Are you not learning from the lessons of history? Are you not condemned to relive them? You cannot play political make-believe with people’s lives. Your people and people across Europe came out onto the streets to show their displeasure at the medication for the Eurocrats’ mental illness. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, and this year people across Europe will have the chance to put a dagger in the heart of the European Union. A significant number of these people have plenty of time to go to the polling station as they are unemployed, a core failure of the EU project. Mr Samaras, you are in make-believe land if you think the EU is the solution. In the UK we also have a leader who lives in make-believe land and who believes that he can renegotiate serious powers from the EU before a referendum. But we have heard this con trick before. The British people have waited far too long to have the choice to leave this corrupt and doomed mess that is the EU. In May’s elections we will let the people decide. We will put the option on the ballot paper in Britain for the people to demand a referendum now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, as a member of the Chilean delegation I visited Chile last year. I am quite happy with the Free Trade Agreement we have with Chile, and I agree that Chile has proved itself to be a strong and reliable trade partner. Great strides forward have been made in Chile with respect to human rights. It is now a fully functioning democracy and has put aside all its past troubles, but I think we must be very strong with the human rights element throughout Latin America.  I attend lots of talks where people ask me about Free Trade Agreements, as they wonder what exactly they are and I have to tell them. They ask if the United Kingdom would not have a Free Trade Agreement if it left the European Union. That is a good question, because here we are with a Free Trade Agreement with countries on the other side of the world, yet the threat to the people that I represent is that if you leave the EU you would not have a Free Trade Agreement. I think it is probably relevant that I make the point here in the Chamber at some point, so I have done so tonight. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, well, here we are still in very great economic hardship across the continent, and what does the European Union decide to discuss at the top of the agenda for a Council meeting? Defence. I would argue that across Europe – not just the United Kingdom – defence is way down the list of people's concerns and of what they want to discuss. They want to discuss employment, they want to discuss how much it costs them to live, growing inflation, but that is not what you want to talk about. You want to talk defence. We have heard the Commission here talking about competing with the USA. Why would you want to compete with the USA? We are 28 sovereign nations. There is no will, in the United Kingdom at least, to be one sovereign nation called the European Union. You have to have the consent of people, but you do not want that. You want to move forward in this one superstate. We should not be competing with the USA. We should be working with the USA. Why do we want to reinvent the wheel? We have NATO and NATO is tried and tested. We need to reinvigorate NATO. That is what we need to do.  And employment? And the euro? You are congratulating yourself because Latvia is joining. You have had sticking plaster over sticking plaster on your euro single currency and the wound has congealed, and you are putting another one on with Latvia. But we all know what happens when you leave a plaster on. The wound becomes infected and when you finally have to remove that plaster, it is far more painful – and that is as good an analogy as I have for the euro. It will be a painful, slow decline and, when it finally rips apart, it will hurt and it will hurt the people of Europe. Stop this madness now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, the European Social Fund’s remit is to invest in people and to support employment, especially amongst the young who see their futures receding in a Europe of austerity and unemployment. I know the EU food aid programme, the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived, is also to receive its funding through the ESF.  In my constituency of the West Midlands, my office has collected over three tonnes of food for distribution to food banks. Across the country, more than 350 000 people are dependent on these food banks to feed themselves and their families. It has been estimated that if current trends continue, more than half a million people could be receiving food parcels by 2016. These are basic supplies, not luxury foods and wine such as those that will be enjoyed in the Members’ dining room today. A recent study found that malnutrition is on the rise in the UK. One in ten older people are malnourished. This fact is a warning sign and it is where the problem first becomes apparent. The Archbishop of Canterbury just three days ago insisted on a plea for more financial support for the rapidly expanding network of food banks. We see it here debating new legislation whilst people are suffering back home. There is a joke that is popular in England at the moment. President Barroso is asked by a Greek citizen: Have we achieved full European integration? The answer from Barroso is: Oh no, it will get a lot worse yet. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, we certainly need more women in our boardrooms. We certainly need more women in politics. There can be no doubt about that. The question is how we go about it. I do not believe, Ms Reding, that your proposals will help the situation. I think that, on the contrary, they will make it worse. Women business leaders tell me that, actually, they do not want to be put on boards by patronising laws. They want to be put there on merit. Now, speaking as someone who has been discriminated against, I think all forms of discrimination are wrong, as is positive discrimination, because positive discrimination is discrimination, and discrimination creates victims. It does not matter what gender you are: if you believe in equality and you create discrimination, you create a victim. Ms Reding, do not legislate to make victims. That is not what you are in your job to do. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, businesses – small, medium and large – have been contacting me in their droves about this much-vaunted EU investment, this mythical EU money that the pro-European argument says the UK is so heavily dependent on. Let us put aside the argument that EU money actually does not exist. The fact is that there have been no calls, from 2000 onwards, for grants. This is because delays in agreeing budgets have led to indecision and confusion over such EU funds. Civil society, the bedrock of democracy, is promised EU grants, but again there has been too much uncertainty and, more disastrously, inaction. I note, on the other hand, that the EU is not too slow when taking our money – our taxpayers’ money – but is too arrogant and negligent in throwing back some crumbs. No wonder the people of the United Kingdom have decided – and want to decide in a referendum – that they no longer want to be part of this sham and that they want to spend their money in the United Kingdom, not propping up some failing countries across Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, this is on a point of order which I will come to, but as a Member representing the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom where Malala now resides and where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, I congratulate this remarkable young woman who is deserving of this prize.  My point of order is quite significant. It is incredibly disappointing that you disrespected this Chamber and that the announcement was not made here live. It was announced on Twitter 30 minutes ago. I think you Mr President have disrespected this Chamber by announcing it on Twitter before doing so in this Chamber. (Mixed reactions) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, I would question the title of this debate about the Rise of right-wing extremism in Europe. Surely it should be about ‘extremism’. Commissioner Reding, I know your desire for equality, maybe you can tell us when we are going to debate ‘left-wing’ extremism, just in the name of equality. A key dynamic in politics is the relationship between the centre and the periphery. The centre, where power lies, in a truly democratic society is in a constant state of flux as opinion, debate and events filter to the centre and shift our values and priorities; this is very healthy. However, if those in power at the centre refuse to listen to the people whose concerns may be inconvenient, then by ignoring them they push them further out towards the periphery. They push them towards the extremes. Extreme thought, extreme speech and, ultimately, extreme acts.  It is no surprise to political observers in Britain that the far right only ever takes seats from the left: our Labour party, not the Conservative party. When Prime Minister Gordon Brown infamously labelled the respectable Labour voter, Gillian Duffy, as a bigot – simply for expressing genuine concerns about immigration and economic policy that differed to his own – he became a recruiting sergeant for extremists.  The blame for the rise of extremism lies at the feet of the political class that refuses to take account of the opinions and concerns of the electorate and the people to whom they should be accountable. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, well, here we go again. Squirm time for the European bureaucrats. They must really hate this, having to answer and put forward their figures because, seriously, they do not like scrutiny and they do not like transparency. This whole report lacks scrutiny, and it lacks transparency in the withholding of documents relating to significant expenditure – namely the purchase of the Residence Palace in Brussels, as previously mentioned – and in the refusal of the Council to address questions raised by a democratically-elected Parliament. A democratically elected Parliament! Her Majesty’s Government has drawn attention in the last few days to a cosy agreement in place since the 1970s, that two institutions would not scrutinise each other’s spending. Why are you so afraid of democratic scrutiny? You control Europe, you spend taxpayers’ money, your accounts for the whole of this institution have not been audited for 18 years and you do not care about democracy. I told my constituents in the West Midlands, the industrial heartland of the United Kingdom about this. I am not sure that they actually believed me. Incidentally, we British have a name for opaque and cosy arrangements such as these. We call them Spanish practices. I am very pleased that the rapporteur advocates voting against discharge of the 2011 budget. Of course, any agreement for scrutiny of another institution should be mutual. I would welcome scrutiny of this institution’s spending by the Council and I think the people of Great Britain would also welcome it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am amazed that we have had this State of the Union address today. I am surprised that Mrs Merkel has not asked us to postpone it until after the German general election. Well, Mr Barroso, this was your fourth and last State of the Union address and you have brought along the rest of your appointed Commission – for support. Never before has a tier of this Parliament been filled with such incompetence and failure. A question, why is it that it is the President of the unelected arm of the EU that gives this address? Why is it not President Schulz? One Member of your Commission is here today, despite only having an attendance record of 52%, almost as low as a UKIP MEP. Your flagship policy, when you became President, was the much-vaunted Lisbon Strategy which seeks to make the EU the most dynamic economy in the world. That sank without trace. In fact the EU has gone into reverse. Unemployment, especially among youth, is rocketing and little Miss Red Tape sitting next to you is not helping. Mr Barroso, your own Commission’s poll shows there is no trust in the EU. The people of the biggest five countries feel the EU is not working. Two-thirds of people across the EU think their views are not being heard. No wonder – but when they do express an opinion, for example in a rare referendum, they are treated with contempt and told that somehow they do not understand. The arrogance is palpable. The people must be listened to. Let the people decide. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I was extremely disappointed that Mr Barroso did not answer my main question: why it should be he, the unelected representative of an EU institution, giving the State of the Union address rather than the elected representative, Mr Schulz. Maybe you could help me on this point, Mr Barroso? We do not agree on much, and I do not agree with your vision of a united Europe, but I do agree with you, Mr Barroso, that if the club is going to prosper, if it is going to work, you need all the members inside working towards that. I need to ask you then: why do you not challenge the UK to put up or shut up? Why do you go along with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, pretending that he can renegotiate to recover powers from the European Union? Are you saying that he can renegotiate certain items from the Treaty of Rome? Can you just make it clear, once and for all, that renegotiation of significant powers such as the Social Chapter is not possible? Is it not damaging to the European Union to have the UK in its current predicament until 2017? Is it not time for the UK and its people to decide, sooner rather than later, whether they want the country to remain a member of the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, these elections have had progressively lower turnouts, election by election. In fact the electorate is generally voting on national issues, which shows that the plan for a federal Europe does not really have public consent, does it? Even where there have been referendums, you federalists have been defeated until you have made the voters vote again. You do not care about the voters of Europe, do you? Mr Duff, the British press has today carried criticism of your plan for pan-European political parties to participate in our elections. What you clearly do not understand is that the people do not want this. Latvian accession to the single currency was approved today by this Parliament, despite an admission in the – appropriately named – Balz report that the Latvian people do not really want it. You talk in the report about citizens being ‘directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament’. They already are represented by Members they have voted for, but the traditional view of a democratic representative is not good enough for you, is it, Mr Duff? Of course this is not what we really want, is it? What you want, Mr Duff, is for citizens to be represented by people who agree with your own federalist vision of Europe. The people may not want that, Mr Duff, but what does that really matter to you? What we need is a referendum about our membership of the European Union. That is what the people of the United Kingdom want. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, medical practitioners will know the acronym FTT well. It stands for ‘failure to thrive’. The idea of imposing new taxes on European business at a time of economic hardship and rising unemployment has been described as perverse and unacceptable by the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. But this is not an economic decision, is it? This is a political project. Even Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, stated recently that the FTT posed a very real risk to the economy, confirming the observation by Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, that even amongst the 11 Member States that agreed to press forward, there is not unqualified support.  For a financial transaction tax to work, it would have to be global, as its proposer, James Tobin, stated, but do we think for one minute that the G20 would be prepared to follow the lead of the people who inflicted the euro area on the world? Tomorrow we will vote on whether to allow Latvia to buy the last ticket on the Titanic. This tax must never be allowed to set sail. It should be strangled at birth. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I contend that the EU is the sick man of the developed world, as much mentally ill as physically. The EU leaders meet for another late-night supper, then adjourn to the drawing room for their usual game of economic bluff, while quislings put together some incoherent mumbo-jumbo communiqué. The idea of the game is simple: to let all 27 leaders leave with some credibility and be able to say that something has been won for their countries. In the UK we know that the game is EU deception: a game our last eight Prime Ministers have played in Brussels. The real losers are the people of Europe, who pay for this late-night folly. Some ex-players of the game, such as former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, have now said that it is time the UK left the EU. Of course he was rounded on by Europhile business leaders coming out with the usual tripe about UK trade being affected. I wholeheartedly agree with his response on the BBC this week, when he called them economic illiterates. We know about these scaremongering stories; during the single currency debate of the late 1990s, Nissan warned that they would remove their investment from the UK if we did not join the euro. Well, they did not. In fact they invested more.  I suggest a new game for Thursday night called ‘reality’, where Europe’s leaders realise that their beloved Europe federal project has failed and that the single currency is unsustainable without the express consent of the people of Europe to federalising steps, and understand that the people of the UK no longer wish to subsidise your pie-in-the-sky projects whilst they are suffering crippling cut-backs at home. I understand that the best treatment for mental illness is accepting the illness and accepting reality. I commend it to you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is wonderful that Heads of Government and Heads of State come here to set out their agenda, and dialogue is never a bad thing. However, I think there is one notable exception, or rather one person who has not come here who has a lot to say about Europe. That is the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who reckons he can renegotiate, for example, the Social Chapter. Is it not about time that he came to this Chamber and explained what he really meant, so that we, the elected representatives of people across Europe, could see whether the UK actually could renegotiate its terms of membership? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Madam President, many of my colleagues here today have called for one voice for the European Union, indeed one mentioned ambassadors rather than heads of delegation. But surely that needs some type of federalism? The European Union does not have a mandate for that. That is why, in my view, the EEAS is fundamentally flawed. I am sure it is a big problem for Baroness Ashton to carry out her duties when she cannot speak for all 27 nations. But I cannot help the feeling that she is part-author of her own problems. Of course she was leader of the Lords when she pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, when she argued there was no fundamental change of power. And here she is in fact really wanting more power. So which was it, Baroness Ashton? You know, you cannot have it both ways. The only way that the EU can actually speak with one voice is if it gives a mandate from the people. One specific question that I would really like you to answer this afternoon: in what capacity, Baroness Ashton, were you at the Champions League final this year? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, while I welcome this debate about poverty in Europe, I think that using EU funding to tackle domestic poverty issues is highly unfair to the taxpayers of those few countries that actually make significant contributions to the EU budget. In the UK, there is a growing resentment towards those Member States that are seen as being takers. It is deeply regrettable that the UK, with its great tradition of helping those less fortunate than itself, has a growing resentment about funding this or that EU project while British people are suffering crippling cutbacks at home. No wonder more and more people are turning against the European Union. Only last week, the leading philanthropist Bill Gates, a regular visitor to the European Parliament, congratulated the United Kingdom on its remarkable record in foreign aid – a record, incidentally, that the EU likes to piggyback on and take credit for.  This report acknowledges that Member States should take responsibility for issues of poverty and social inclusion, and that the fund for European aid and the most deprived should not be seen as replacing those responsibilities. But what message is being sent out by the call for an increased budget for the fund for 2014-2020? Who will supply this extra money: the 200 000 British citizens who are dependent on food banks in order to feed their families, or the growing army of unemployed youth? The economic crisis, largely the fault of the eurozone, is now so bad that we have to say charity begins at home. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, 1.3 million families – that is one in four families in England – are on lower incomes. They have to spend a third of their net income on housing, largely owing to the shortage of private rental sector housing, which was exacerbated in the 1980s by the Conservative Party’s failure to build social housing programmes and the Labour Party of the 1990s failing to tackle that issue. I am glad that this is a national competence, and it should stay a national competence. However, the EU has a detrimental impact. We currently have a government in the United Kingdom saying that it does not know how many people who will be coming from Romania and Bulgaria, or indeed from across the European Union. How are our local authorities supposed to make provision when current provision does not meet demands? This is why we have problems of people in the private sector not being able to afford housing on a third of their income – some GBP 500 in Coventry. That is not affordable, and we cannot provide this any longer. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, one word: ‘consistency’. I will repeat it again so that the interpreters get it to you in time: ‘consistency’. I have been here four years, and not once have I been told that you have to have the question in before the start of the process. This is the first time this has happened. If this is the case, then you should announce it before the votes even begin. It was my understanding that you had to have your request for a question in before the subject or report was brought up. It is a complete inconsistency, and you are denying me my full mandate by not allowing me my explanation of vote on this report, so I ask you once again to give me my explanation of vote because you are denying me my mandate.

Mr President, I have heard of the carrot and stick approach, but I have never heard of the carrot and carrot approach. That seems to be the EU’s relationship with Turkey. It seems to give, give, give.  Can I remind this institution that the Cypriots held the Presidency in the latter part of 2012 and Turkey point blank refused to actually have anything to do with them, although they were a candidate country. Well if the candidate country does not want to have anything to do with its Presidency, surely the candidature should be ceased there and then.  The people of Cyprus are held hostage by the invaders and occupiers of northern Cyprus. The people of Morphou last November, together with myself, attempted to visit their town and were refused free access to their old town by the Turkish authorities. The people of Kyrenia wished to celebrate a religious service in their town over the coming Easter and have been refused by the Turkish authorities.  Baroness Ashton is being her usual, useless self and is unable to help. Is it not about time we got real on Turkey? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, first of all I would like to express my agreement with the comment made about the Boston bombing. I send my condolences to the victims and their families, and my best wishes to the injured. Terrorism must not, and will never, succeed. The debate is about the future of the European Union, and I must say that I normally struggle to make my case in a minute, but such a debate is a very short one. What future does it have? Is it like the Soviet empire that had a blatant disregard for its people, which ignores it opinions and fails to give referendums – and when it does, it ignores the result and then calls for other referendums? Does it steal the savings of ordinary people, like it did in Cyprus? Does it disregard an occupying force in North Cyprus, even though it is part of the European Union – which unbelievably has the status of Nobel Prize Winner? Is this the future of the European Union? No. The future of the European Union is doomed. It is doomed to failure. It does not have a democratic mandate. You are frightened of the people. The European Union is failing, and that is why the UK needs to be out of it soon. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, a week ago we lost a great political figure, a woman who achieved the highest office in the land from humble beginnings – in fact, the first elected woman in the western world. Incidentally she achieved that without the need of a quota, something which this House believes so firmly in. When she took office, the United Kingdom was the sick man of Europe, but her strong policies, handling of the economy and dealing with trade unions – a lesson which the French and Germans still have not learnt in thirty years – transformed the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The President, Mr Schultz, called her a great European. She did believe in the membership of the European Community and she signed the Single European Act, but when she realised it was getting into a federal Europe and a single currency she said, ‘No, no, no’, and that is why the cowards stabbed her in the back. From a personal point of view she inspired me into politics. I was ten when she was elected and I met her just three months before I was elected, and when I told her that I was coming here to fight for British independence from the European Union she told me never to give up, never to give up, and I can assure you I will never give up fighting for my country’s independence.

Mr President, my colleague talks about integrity, but maybe he would like to comment on the integrity of the EU in its last foray into professional football – the Bosman ruling – which I would say has probably caused some of the problem.  What it has done is taken the wealth from a lot of the smaller clubs and transferred it to the bigger clubs and created overpaid footballers, and underpaid footballers at a grassroots level. That is where the people who are involved in organised crime are actually attacking lower paid footballers. It is in the lower leagues that this match-fixing is taking place. The Bosman ruling – an EU ruling – has created that problem. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, this issue is close to my heart, as a lover of sport and a football season-ticket holder and sponsor of football at all levels, including grassroots. It is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Some people like to call it the beautiful game. Clearly, we are learning that football is becoming noticeably more grubby and sullied. According to experts, as many as ten matches a week in Europe are now affected by match-fixing. The numbers of games affected worldwide is astonishing.  However, it is not enough to look at this issue from a purely European perspective. Can we trust the EU Commission, with its history of corruption, to clear up sport? Maybe it is a ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’.  Match-fixing is an endemic problem across the world. Until nations and football authorities get their houses in order, how can we expect anything to change? Take a look at FIFA, for example, a body that has been dogged by accusations of corruption; or the FA back in my own country that fails to implement a working fit-and-proper-persons test, which allows vulnerable clubs to fall into the wrong hands.  Many of the players that get caught up in match-fixing accusations are often poorly paid, poorly educated and poorly protected. It is not enough for Europol to investigate this problem. UEFA has far more member countries than the EU, so proposed EU action would be an irrelevance. It is about time that we had transparent football authorities and legislation from national governments to stamp out this organised crime in football once and for all. I believe football can be beautiful again. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 I voted against this report not because I do not want to decrease the amount of MEPs far from it. I actively campaign for my own redundancy and the other 72 UK MEPs. I voted for the previous defeated amendment to call for the matter to be referred to an Independent body to determine to size and make-up of future parliaments. Politicians should not determine alone how they are to be elected. Also, this report allows for enlargement. Something I am opposed to. The EU cannot deal with itself at the moment let alone getting larger. To those countries that will lose an MEP, they should not worry, when the UK leaves they will have 73 seats to redistribute.

Mr President, once again Europe’s leaders will meet for a late night supper. The agenda may talk of growth and jobs, but we have heard it all before and nothing improves. Only lip service will be paid to jobs and growth. The real conversation over the foie gras will be how to save your beloved political project of European federalisation. The talk will be about how to keep Italy in line after its comical election and how to downplay yet another country, Cyprus, seeking a new bailout. British people know that problems come from Europe and they pay for them with cold, hard cash and the reduction of essential public services. British people are getting more and more fed up with the European Union. May I take this opportunity to thank Mr Barroso for helping with this. Despite Mr Cameron’s attempts to knock a referendum into the long grass, the British people demand a referendum on our membership now. My constituents send a clear message to my office, week in, week out, which is that they do not want anything more to do with this corrupt and doomed mess that is the European Union.

Mr President, in a dispute where up to 70 000 people have been killed and a million refugees have fled the country since the crisis began two years ago, the question must be posed: what good is Baroness Ashton? What is her highly expensive and ineffective EEAS achieving to alleviate the situation? The answer is very little, just typical EU lip-service – or you are an expensive lipstick, Mrs Ashton. Your authority is highly questionable. You represent 27 nations who have different outlooks. You have been heavily criticised here today by members of all political groups. Indeed, Mr Cameron said the UK was still an independent country when threatening to veto an EU extension to the arms embargo. What does that make you? Redundant? The situation in Syria is deplorable. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has today visited a UN refugee camp in Jordan and described the situation as heart-breaking. What will you do? Will you at least begin by putting Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, not a single sane person in this Chamber would disagree with me when I say that the common agricultural policy needs reforming.  The EU needs to reduce intervention to a genuine safety net, move towards a market-orientated approach and the end of a situation whereby farmers chase subsidies and not markets – the old-style CAP market production box marked ‘Failed projects’ it should be confined to.  What reform are we really going to see here? We have been talking about this for two years, and a quarter of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development opposed the report. What message does that send to the farming sector? Both environmentalists and farmers alike are highly critical of the green aspects of these proposals. How then can the public believe that their environmental concerns have been addressed? I believe that the people who are best qualified to look after the British landscape are the British farmers, not unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. The CAP is expensive and over-bureaucratised, and farmers in my constituency constantly contact me about this. It adds to the weekly food bill of every family in Great Britain. Professor Patrick Minford of Cardiff Business School, a leading critic of the CAP, is on record as stating that the average family would be much better off if we left the European Union, not only in terms of cheaper food.

Mr President, I have a question for my colleague. He has talked about potential national interest and each Member’s country not wanting to lose one. We have also had a slight accusation against my colleague, Mr Duff, that he may be doing it for political purposes. Does this not show that politicians should not determine how politicians are elected? The EU employs far more bureaucrats than necessary. Should it not be done without politicians making these decisions and just determined by independent bodies, as is done in the UK? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, democracy is far from perfect. While I feel that there should be some protection for some smaller countries, I think it is only fair to inform you that my country, the United Kingdom, is greatly under-represented. In fact, I represent a region, the West Midlands, which has some 5 million people. At the last election, six of us were elected, so that was about 900 000 people each.  We have Maltese MEPs and Luxembourgish MEPs, with populations of half a million also returning six MEPs. Now, I make a great effort in communicating with my constituents, but my allowances have to stretch to 5 million people, whereas an MEP from Luxembourg or Malta – with only 500 000 and a much smaller geographical area – is put at great advantage. I do not think that is taken into consideration. (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, this is a rather difficult subject, and I would say at the outset that I do not blame any immigrants who want to try and make a better life for themselves. What I do feel is that the politicians have let down the immigrants and the settled community. In 2004, when the Eastern Bloc countries joined the EU, our Labour Government told us that we would only have 14 000 people coming into the UK. Well, it hit over a million people. How were our local service providers – our National Health Service, our housing – able to plan ahead for that? Next year, we face more people coming from Bulgaria and Romania. How are our social services in the United Kingdom, which are already cut to the bone, and our taxpayers, who are paying more money, supposed to support that? It simply does not work. I am glad to see that our own government is beginning to take a stance on this, but even it cannot tell us how many people are coming next year. That is a fundamental problem with planning for social services in the United Kingdom. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am making a point of order on a point of order.

You acted beyond your responsibilities in not taking my point of order earlier. The point of order was that the Non-Attached element of this House had not made any speech at all and yet you had given the catch-the-eye to groups that had spoken on numerous occasions.

Austerity is detrimental to disabled people (8 % of the UK population), who are finding themselves in a worst position of poverty than ever before. In the UK we have endured constant reassessments of the work capability assessment, which has led to the deaths and suicides of 73 disabled people per week. It is abhorrent that 29 % of the cuts are focused on disabled people. Fewer people are entitled to support from their local authorities, and we will see the introduction of personal independence payments to replace disability living allowance, which is set to knock over half a million people off support. There is also a proposal to close the Independent Living Fund permanently. The proposal by the government is to transfer monies to cash strapped local authorities; which are already saying that they will institutionalise disabled people, to save money. These are just some of the cuts impacting on disabled people in the UK, estimated to take GBP 9 billion from the poorest in society. No wonder British people are sick and tired of the EU. We have a saying ‘Charity begins at home’. Britain needs to look after its vulnerable people and not be hampered by sending GBP 53 million every day to the EU. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I really do have to admit I would love to be a fly on the wall in this Friday’s EU Budget talks in Brussels. I would like to see the discomfort of Mr Cameron as he walks into the room, the tension in his neck at the thought that he has to confront Mr Hollande and his colleagues throughout Europe. He has put referenda back on the agenda and he is going to have to sit down and fight for the British interest. He says he wants a renegotiation, but President Schulz has already told this Parliament that renegotiation is not possible. Mr Verhofstadt told the BBC renegotiation is not possible, so who is going to give? Are they going to be shown to be fools, or is Mr Cameron going to be shown to be a fool? I think Mr Cameron is trying to pull a Houdini act here. He is trying to appease the Eurosceptic majority in the UK, while trying to appease the European Union. This Houdini act is bound to fail and he will be shown to be more like Tommy Cooper.  My constituents tell me they do not want GBP 53 million spent in the EU. That money is better spent at home.

 Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague why she does not think the expenditure in this Parliament is too great. Two years ago the entertainment budget for MEPs or for Parliament went up 80%. Do you not think that was a substantial increase? In December, in the courtyard here in Strasbourg, we saw extortionate expenditure on television screens and posters that are still there about celebrating the Sakharov Prize. In that week each Member of Parliament and each member of staff was given probably five, six or seven pieces of chocolate. Do you not think that was unnecessary expenditure? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I used to go back and tell my constituents that this was the institution that knew no cutbacks. In my first few years as an MEP the allowances just went up and up and up and up. We all got a new member of staff for Lisbon; the attendance allowance went up from EUR 296 to EUR 304 euros. I have already mentioned that the entertainment budget went up 82%; everything just went up and up and up.  As we go towards 2014 you decided to make some minor cutbacks, forgetting what you paid in the first few years. You ignored reality for far too long and now you are wondering what to do. You are making the poor staff here suffer through no fault of their own on account of your political meddling. What about cutting Ms Ashton’s EEAS? What does it actually do? What about cutting that back? What about the shiny new offices for Mr Van Rompuy and Ms Cathy Ashton? And what about the bigger argument as to whether we should be here in Strasbourg? And what about Fridays here in Strasbourg? There are still 80 to 100 MEPs that come here on a Friday morning and sign in and go home when there is no official business. That is about EUR 30 000 month; should that not be cut out for a start? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, corporate social responsibility is a policy concept whereby businesses self-regulate in order to operate in an ethical and sustainable manner in order to understand and meet the needs and expectations of all stakeholders. In this report, however, this concept has been transformed into a jumble of slogans and key words seemingly intended to tick all the right boxes without explaining how exactly anything is to be actually achieved.  The concept of self-regulation has gone from this report and has seemingly been replaced by vague calls for Commission strategies, Commission guidelines, even concrete proposals from the Commission for the implementation of corporate socially responsible practices. The rapporteur – even if now he wants businesses, enterprises, to be responsible for solving social issues caused by the economic crisis – believes that the economic crisis has shaken employees’ faith in corporations to meet their pension obligations. No, Mr Howitt, it is the EU and the eurozone crisis that has done that.  This report flits from subcontracting to low carbon technology and to gender equality in the blink of an eye. The rapporteur calls for the launch of a new EU initiative on advancing materiality. He wants the EU to back a proposal for a UN convention on corporate responsibility. More bureaucracy is the last thing that businesses need at this time. The report refers to short-term thinking in Brussels in one breath and with the next it calls on the Commission to show leadership. It takes a concept based on self-regulation by wide, diverse and economic actions in 27 Member States and seeks to turn it into an EU competence where one size will not fit at all. It reads like a student manifesto, a first-year student manifesto. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, let us rewind a little. Before you roll out your latest grandiose plan, let us take a look back. Do you remember the Lisbon Agenda? Let me refresh your memory. It was adopted for a ten-year period in 2000 by the European Council. It broadly aimed to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. How did that go for you? Not well. You replaced it with another plan. Now your beloved political project is in dire straits. Millions across Europe are in despair, and now you are scurrying around looking for another plan. You cannot accept the political reality that your project is fundamentally flawed. Your foundations are as strong as the blancmange that I had for dessert last night. Whilst the euro sails into the rocks, the three presidents grandstand with the Nobel Prize. Did Nelson Mandela grandstand in the same manner? Did Barack Obama? No. They had dignity, and we are not seeking to create some useful diversion to problems so destructive to the peoples of Europe. No wonder the people of the UK demand a referendum to have their say on this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, is it not deeply ironic in a debate about democracy that this Parliament is using rules to actually stifle debate? We are not allowed to use blue cards or catch-the-eye, which means that very small entities such as the non-attached Members get no speaking time at all. Of course we will all be standing in elections in 2014. You did say at the start of the debate that there would be no catch-the-eye, but you did not say, and it has not previously been put in any of the material or by e-mail, that there would be no blue cards.

– Madam President, my constituents will not be too surprised to learn that their hard-earned money taken by taxes and passed on to the EU is being negligently handed out by the net recipients of the EU budget. In a week when many Member States are seeking an increase in the EU budget to just over EUR one trillion, my constituents in the UK say this is unacceptable in a time of austerity. The blame for the failure to have the audit signed off for the 18th year lies firmly at the door of the unelected bureaucrats of the EU. They have failed the taxpayers of Europe once again. I note that 60 % of the errors found by the Court could have been detected by Member States, yet it is the quagmire of rules and unnecessary complications that is at fault. And what is the EU doing to correct this? It is not even notifying the Member States concerned of the direct problems. One of the examples of the billions wasted is the EUR 700 million to establish the rule of law and reduce corruption in Kosovo, but the results are poor according to the report. Staff delegated were not even sufficiently trained, yet the EU thinks that by throwing in taxpayers’ money without reasonable constraint it can solve the problem. And what about pan-European parties? What about public financing of political parties such as the right-wing extremist parties to which some UKIP Members have signed up, some Nazis – what about the financing of that? A colleague of mine talked about confidence. Well, the people of the UK have less and less confidence in the EU, which is why we need an in-or-out referendum, sooner rather than later. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I can say with some certainty that, in times of austerity, my constituents do not want their taxes spent on political campaigns and propaganda. I voted against these proposals that seek to further the use of pan-European parties, with all their expense and their ideology of promoting EU federalism. The majority of people in the UK do not share an EU identity. In successive EU elections, people have used the elections to express their disapproval of the EU. Opinion poll after opinion poll shows dissatisfaction with the EU and a wish for a referendum. My constituents do not wish to hear propaganda, paid for by their taxes, telling them how great the EU is. They feel the reality of cutbacks in public services, whilst the UK pays more and more to the EU – a luxury we cannot afford. In 2014 the We Demand a Referendum Party will put on the ballot paper those words, ‘We demand a referendum’. This will allow the electorate from the UK to send you, and our government, a message, loud and clear, that we demand an in-out referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, once again we have a summit that promises a solution but in the fullness of time delivers little but further EU integration. Through the fault of unelected, incompetent Eurocrats and blinded Member State leaders, the financial crisis is being used as a tool for further EU integration. What a heavy price we are paying for the Eurocrats’ fantasy of a United States of Europe. Have they learned nothing from their folly? President Barroso and his apparatchiks care little for the ordinary person. This latest round has been done on the back of the Greek collapse and the 43 % increase in the suicide rate there. My fear is for the UK which, despite being out of the eurozone, is seemingly unaffected. Yet this deal fails to safeguard the City of London and its prosperity. David Cameron has given the green light to banking union and got nothing in return. Why? Was this not the opportunity to renegotiate some of those powers back from the European Union, as Cameron endlessly promises? It shows his words to be empty and that once again we have a Conservative Party which talks tough on Europe, with its sprinkling of Judas goats. But Cameron turns out to be nothing more than the German Chancellor’s poodle. Three out of four Conservative voters want an ‘in or out’ referendum but are being deceived by their leadership, which continues to sleepwalk the UK into a federal Europe. So I call on those Conservative supporters to stand up to David Cameron for the future of your party and for our country. Send him a loud message: we demand a referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I recently spent some time in Cyprus, taking part in anti-occupation events against the illegal Turkish occupation, which has now been going on for 38 years. Turks hold 38 % of Cypriot lands when Cyprus is actually part of the European Union. It was while I was in Cyprus that I learned that the European Union had won the Nobel Peace Prize. That may be a joke, but not for the people of Cyprus. Part of that award was for dispute resolution, but what has the European Union done to help the people of Cyprus? There were 1 619 people missing after the Turkish invasion. Not enough work has been done. Yet Turkey is still a candidate country and does not even recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is an EU Member State. It does not even recognise the Cyprus EU Presidency. What is the European Union doing about this? It is an absolute joke. I call for justice for internal refugees in Cyprus and justice and human rights for the families of the missing people.

– Madam President, when I listen to Baroness Ashton extolling the great successes of the European External Action Service, I am reminded of the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, where a well-meaning but seriously challenged and naive young man finds himself at the centre of events. He was surrounded by the great and the good, but was never really sure of what was going on. We have seen the faltering and sometimes painful transition to democracy of the long-suffering peoples in the Arab Spring; the ongoing civil war in Syria; fears over nuclear proliferation; the death of Gaddafi; and the return of Putin. These are challenging times in which we are seeing relationships and dynamics redefined. However, at a recent meeting with an exasperated diplomat from the Middle East, he told me that he regarded the High Representative as being more of a hindrance than a help. We all understand that Baroness Ashton drew the short straw. Her role is that of a caretaker of an unformed entity. History is unlikely to remember her in any great detail, but she once found herself elevated to the British House of Lords without ever receiving a single vote in any democratic election. As Forrest Gump pointed out so eloquently, life is like a box of chocolates and we will never know what comes next. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I should like to begin by saying kalimera
, President Christofias. It was a delight to meet you when I came to Nicosia in 2009. Can I pay tribute to your efforts to solve the Cyprus problem; a problem which is way overdue. The ongoing insult given to you by the Turkish Government of not recognising you as the President of Cyprus is something which should be highlighted in this Chamber. I would call on you and the EU to remove the candidate status of Turkey, because they have shown themselves not able to communicate with the European Community. You talk about this as being a bastion of democracy. However, you were educated in Russia and you would have seen how the Duma was no more a bastion of democracy than this place is in relation to the Politburo, which is probably likened to the Commission led by Mr Barroso, who uses this place as a veil of democracy for its actions. You are right to highlight that the problem of your Presidency is the plight of workers. In Athens you will find graffiti that says: let us refuse to live as slaves. Your background and your ideology as a Communist will make this very difficult for you. How are you going to protect the workers or stand up for the workers with the austerity that Angela Merkel and the rest of the European Union is pushing forward? Surely you would agree with me that EU 2020 lacks 20/20 vision? I have no doubt it will be as successful as the Lisbon Strategy, which was meant to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. You said in an interview on television last night not to expect a mountain from Cyprus. Well, the EU is the Everest of all … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question to Ioannis Kasoulides. 
– 
Mr President, I wish to ask the gentleman why he thought the attack on the United Kingdom was warranted. Let me remind him that my country has backed up EUR 10 billion in IMF guarantees to his country. Our forces are stationed on Cyprus, at costs of tens of millions of pounds every year, to safeguard Cyprus. If it was not for British forces I think that Turkey would have gone a long way further in 1974. But has this place moved on? I thought this place was about the future. What about the Austro-Hungarian Empire? What about Italian colonialism? What about French colonialism? What about Portuguese colonialism? What about German expansion? Are you moving on or do you want to be part of the past? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, many of my constituents have contacted me regarding being disadvantaged by an uneven playing field in the direct payments and CAP in general. Direct payments, or direct subsidies to farmers, account for three quarters of the CAP budget, which, of course, is 48% of the EU budget, so it is quite a considerable amount of money. However, the Conservative-led British Government is reluctant to make use of some of those discretionary funds that are available to support our farmers. In fact, they are increasing the uneven playing field by wishing to voluntarily reduce direct payments faster than any other Member State, which is why I will be voting against Amendments 1 to 12 and 13. The struggles of UK farmers are compounded by the Commission’s ongoing use of the historical distribution key to allocate Pillar 2 funds between Member States. This discrimination against the UK primarily needs to stop. We need a fairer allocation of Pillar 2 farmers and to protect our farmers in the UK. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, the announcement of the ending of cooperation with the Justice and Home Affairs Council has taken me somewhat by surprise, considering the previous criticisms of the United Kingdom for taking its ball away when it decide not to cooperate with the European Council. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, this act purports, via a package of measures, to boost assistance for small and medium businesses yet I fear, once again, it is nothing more than comforting words to give the appearance of action. The reality is that the European Union is part of the problem, not the solution. Europhiles like Malcolm Harbour tell us that Britain’s future depends on membership of the European Union, that more than half of our trade is with the EU. These are disingenuous arguments. Eighty percent of UK trade is internal, with 50% of the rest being with the EU. That is only 10% of UK trade, for which we have had a deficit since the early 1970s. Yet the EU and its bureaucratic rules and regulations are draining the life out of small and medium enterprises. No wonder the Federation of Small Businesses said to prospective MEPs in the 2009 European election guide, please, no more EU regulations. Malcolm Harbour attended a dinner, as I did. Commissioner Barnier, there are 4.5 million small businesses in the UK that account for 99% of all enterprise. That is almost 60% of private sector employment and almost 50% of private sector turnover. SMEs employ an estimated 13.8 million people and have an estimated combined annual turnover of GBP 1 500 billion. The EU has constantly negatively impacted on their ability to service the majority of their contracts, whilst making it easier for other EU countries to trade in the UK. No wonder eight out of ten people want a referendum on Britain’s membership of this corrupt and doomed mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, while I am opposed to this institution, I welcome any forum to discuss an issue that is so repugnant. Worldwide, it is estimated that well over 120 million women will be subjected to female genital mutilation. The aim of the process is to ensure that the woman is faithful to her future husband. Some communities consider girls ineligible for marriage if they have not been circumcised. How can you use religion and cultural tradition to excuse child abuse? It has been reported that girls as young as three undergo this process. Member States must tackle, and take a lead in combating, this despicable crime. Where the crime takes place in a Member State, strong custodial sentences must be passed. When aid is provided to countries where this is prevalent, conditions must be put in place to send a clear message that this practice must stop. Thankfully, due to health campaigns, female circumcision has been falling in some countries in the last decade. These involve a week-long programme of community education about the negative effects of female genital mutilation, culminating in a coming of age ceremony for young women. The young women are secluded for a week and undergo classes on reproduction, anatomy, hygiene, respect for adults, developing self-esteem and dealing with peer pressure. All of us here must do whatever we can to stop this barbarism. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, this issue stems from the failure of the French authorities to regulate its manufacturing industry. Typically, ‘France has a take it or leave it’ approach to regulations that it expects other countries to adopt. In June 2000, US medical regulators posted a warning letter on the Internet about problems at a breast implant maker in southern France. The French authorities did not pay this much attention. The French health authorities acknowledged as much in a 175-page report published on 1 February this year. Radical change is needed in Europe to ensure proper surveillance of medical devices. France has shown itself incapable of regulating itself and should have external checks. Many thousands of women have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, because of French negligence. France should be made to compensate all women affected by this negligence. In future, there needs to be more communication with the surgeons, the clinics and the patients. These companies must be checked and the findings should be open to inspection by health professionals. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Madam President, I would be interested to know what my colleague feels about Mr Howitt’s response. Not only was Mr Howitt rude by not turning up at his allotted speaking time, but he actually did not answer the question at all. If this Chamber had any credibility, these blue-card questions would be respected. Mr Howitt was asked a question after he said that he did not agree with political appointments; he was asked what he thought of Ms Ashton’s appointment, which was political. What does my colleague think about Mr Howitt’s reply? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, first of all, I did actually ask a question. If I used the words ‘does my colleague agree with me’, that usually begins a question. Now for my speech. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson institutionalised the concept of human rights in the US Declaration of Independence, and today’s US Ambassadors around the world have the responsibility for projecting that concept wherever they may be. In my country, Great Britain, human rights matters come under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, but these models are apparently not good enough for the European Union. The rapporteur calls for a Special Representative for this policy area, complete with his or her budget lines and dedicated staff. It is not, of course, within the realm of possibility that the existing EU overseas delegations could shoulder this responsibility. Might that eat into their four-day weeks and prolonged holiday entitlements? There are incidentally 119 such delegations. Surely, at a time of EU-enforced austerity, in situ apparatus should be used, rather than creating new, expensive departments. One aspect of the report I do agree with is that if a Special Representative for Human Rights should be appointed, they should have the necessary professional qualifications, extensive experience and a proven track record in the field of human rights, as well as personal and professional integrity and an international reputation. The High Representative may feel a little embarrassed at this valid point as these criteria were clearly overlooked in her appointment. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, the ever-growing figure of youth unemployment results from the selfishness of today’s politicians abandoning tomorrow’s prospects. In the UK, there has been a 43% increase in the number of young people aged 18 to 24 who have not had a job for more than two years. It would seem that some have given up on looking for work and are becoming increasingly detached from society. The youth unemployment crisis can be beaten only if job creation for young people becomes a key priority in policy making and private sector investment picks up significantly. My concern is that the EU is far too rigid in its general approach to law making to be of any real assistance to our young people. Yes, you might point to this scheme or that scheme, but the bureaucracy to apply for support is so disproportionate to the assistance required that it becomes self-defeating. The UK needs to offer tax breaks and other incentives to businesses hiring young people and offering more entrepreneurship programmes to help kick-start careers. EU, you are part of the problem, not the solution. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, we have heard a lot of fine words today about small businesses being the backbone of society and our economy, etc., etc., but what about the reality? I am reminded that President De Gaulle scoffed at the English and called us a nation of shopkeepers. But, Mr President, it is our small businesses and our shopkeepers that employ the vast majority of the workforce in the United Kingdom. In my mobile surgery, that goes around every town and city in the West Midlands on a regular basis, I meet shopkeepers who say they are being strangled by European Union regulation; business rates are too high; there is not enough training; there is not enough access to finance. Yet all they hear of, all the time, is more EU funds – the UK being the second largest contributor to the EU but having few recipients of aid and training. Take the European Globalisation Fund: every other country in the EU has had access to this fund except the United Kingdom. This is pertinent in Ryton, near Coventry, where Peugeot closed down in 2005. It also closed plant in France, but the French got training and the people of Coventry did not. Then there are these ‘JEREMIE’ funds, providing funding for small businesses around Europe, including in the south of France – a country that is a member of the G8. Is there any in the UK? No, there is not. Absolutely disgraceful! As I said, we are the second largest contributor to the European Union; we need to cut out the middle man, fund our own small businesses and leave the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, our youth’s prospects are dying of bureaucracy and its weapon of choice, red tape. Youth unemployment is a scourge that will affect Europeans for generations. People who suffer unemployment in their early years subsequently tend to earn much less. They suffer deterioration of skills and future job instability. In Spain, a staggering 46.4% of young people are out of work. Is it any coincidence that the states with the worst problems are members of the eurozone? The OECD has stated that the eurozone crisis is the biggest single threat to global recovery. The eurozone 17 will see their economy shrink by 1.9% this year. In contrast, both the UK and the US economies will grow. More than one in five young people across the European Union as a whole are unemployed and figures released yesterday by the UN suggest that this is set to get worse. UK businesses, both small and large, are crying out for less bureaucracy. Tomorrow, EU leaders will meet in Brussels to discuss jobs and growth. We can expect a self-congratulatory press release and a nice photograph, but we know by now what will happen. Good money will be thrown after bad. Nothing will change and, instead of stemming the red tape that kills jobs, the strangulation will continue. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr Kirkhope, would you join me in calling for the Conservative-led coalition to introduce gay marriage at its earliest possible convenience within the lifetime of this Parliament. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, as an openly gay person myself, I agree with virtually everything that has been said in this Chamber this afternoon, except probably Mr Posselt’s speech. My concern, however, is that we have heard all these grand words condemning homophobia here, but what about practising what you preach? I have been the victim of two homophobic incidents since I have been a member of this Chamber, and Parliament simply has not bothered to act. If you are going to tell other countries, especially third countries, what to do, at least first practise what you preach. Fortunately, as Baroness Ludford has said, I live in a country that has been reported to be one of the best places – or the best place – in the world to be gay. I count myself quite fortunate. Unfortunately, there are many other people in the world who cannot say the same thing. Yet there is a football tournament on our doorstep in Ukraine – which will be held jointly with Poland – and many Members of this House will be travelling to Ukraine as representatives of some organisation or other, or representatives of the European Union, while today, the UK Foreign Office has put a warning out to gay people to be careful travelling to Ukraine. Why should a single member of this House or the European Union go to Ukraine? Should the European Union as a whole not be boycotting the tournament if that country cannot protect citizens? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I have lost count. Is this the 17th year in which the auditors have failed to give a positive declaration on the EU’s budget or, in other words, have we now reached 17 years in which taxpayers’ money has not been properly accounted for? I note the statement in the resolution on the discharge of the Commission budget that progress has been made since the resignation of the Santer Commission, but I have to ask: ‘Really?’ In 2008, Commissioner Mandelson was accused of a conflict of interest after holidaying with a Russian oligarch whose company subsequently benefited from his department’s decisions. In June 2011, Commission President Barroso ran up a EUR 25 000 hotel bill for a four-night luxury stay in New York. Then there was the Commission memo issued by DG Trade in 2009 which encouraged officials to conceal information from public scrutiny. The EU and its institutions have failed to practise what they preach and what places them above the citizens they purport to represent. It is time the UK left this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question. 
– 
Madam President, my colleague Mr Fox alluded to the fact that there are already 27 signatories to the Convention and that this would just be a pruning exercise – or rather a preening exercise – by the European Union. Would he not agree with me that this is a further stage of federalisation and that in the 2010 Conservative manifesto it was stated that it would repeal the Human Rights Act, which was brought in by the Labour Party? Now, if this was actually signed, it would mean that they would not have the power to do so. Is this not another massive transference of sovereignty that his party will allow to happen? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, as a MEP I deal with constituency issues on a daily basis: issues where EU law affects people’s daily lives, either directly or indirectly. I am here to tell you that there is one deeply flawed law that, above all others, damages British life and puts our lives in daily peril. It is the Human Rights Act. It is a rotten law that Britain loathes. Human rights are worth protecting, and I am vocal in the protection of human rights. The Human Rights Act, however, was created in Britain by the Labour Party, which, despite warnings, was reckless as to the consequences. However, this EU-backed – and soon to be enshrined – law is now routinely and regularly abused by those who can cause havoc in civil society. Terrorists, criminals and illegal immigrants, with and without cats. More often than not, judges who apply human rights law decide that those rights trump those of the majority: decent, honest, hard-working British people. The case of Abu Qatada is attracting media attention. The human rights law, by allowing Abu Qatada to dodge deportation to Jordan, has inflamed the British public. Simply, the Court of Human Rights leaves Britain unable to defend its interests. In a recent survey, 75% of British people said they think that the act should be scrapped altogether. It is the Treaty of Lisbon that allows the EU to sign up to the ECHR, which further imprisons the British public, who never got a chance to say no through a referendum. Let me tell you, the British public are shouting aloud: ‘No to the human rights law! Release us from these shackles’.

blue-card answer. 
– 
Madam President, not as big a sigh of relief as the British public would! Yes, Mr Cashman, I agree with you. The Convention on Human Rights was actually written by British lawyers in the early 1950s. It was the Labour Party that signed the Human Rights Act, which enshrined it in British law. That was in 1998. What it actually did was to empower every court, from the most minute up to the Supreme Court (no longer the House of Lords), to apply these human rights, and the judges have taken political jurisprudence. They have not gone along with the public or the elected government. That has to be wrong. In a democracy it should be the will of the people that reigns supreme. If you talk about human rights, Mr Cashman, I want to point out one Labour politician, our High Representative Catherine Ashton – a Labour Party card-carrying member – who refused to do anything about the corrective rape of lesbians in Palestine. That is a disgrace. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I welcome the international dialogue at the conference this week in Marseille. It is imperative that all decision-makers, from local governments through to Member States and the UN, promote initiatives for water quality, availability and affordability. Water is a common good and a human essential, and it is also a human right which should not be used for excessive commercial profit. With this in mind, the fact the Forum’s President, Louis Fauchon, has a foot in both camps is deeply troubling. Member States must give farmers incentives to increase investment in on-farm water storage capacity, which takes up as much as 70% of natural water supply, although the UK National Farmers Union has warned that there is no quick fix. I am also dismayed that in this year of CAP reform – as has been mentioned here by one of my colleagues – there is no mention of this matter. Is this a question of the EU talking with one head and then not talking with the other? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr Howitt, you mentioned two things which I want to bring together: Gaza and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. Would you agree with me and criticise the High Representative for her failure to tackle the issue of corrective rapes of lesbians in Palestine, and also police brutality against LGBT people in Palestine? I visited Gaza and Palestine in November last year. This is evidently a problem that the EU ignores, but it still funds Palestine and it is afraid to tackle this problem on cultural grounds. Would you criticise them for that? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, amongst the items on the agenda at the forthcoming UN Human Rights Council will be Cyprus. I would like to concentrate on human rights issues in Northern Cyprus and their place in negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In Northern Cyprus itself, there have been reports of violations of the human rights and freedom from discrimination of minorities, torture, and violations of freedom of movement, religion and speech. In 1974, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the city of Famagusta was overrun by armour, and the civilian population – fearing massacre – was forced to evacuate, leaving behind everything they could not carry. Only Turks were allowed to remain, and the Varosha section of the city remains isolated and unpopulated to this day. This is in contradiction with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789. Technically, this border dispute does call into question the legitimacy of the Cypriot accession to the European Union. A 112-mile long ‘green line’ still divides the island. 1 588 Greek Cypriots are still on the missing persons list following the Turkish invasion, but still the EU – with the exception of one or two Member States –pushes for Turkey’s accession. By discussing Turkey’s accession whilst unresolved border issues and questions of human rights in Northern Cyprus remain, the EU is undermining the integrity of the United Nations. You are overlooking appalling human rights abuses, and you are making a mockery of the integrity of your own position on human rights. Regarding Turkey’s statement that they would freeze EU ties when Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency, I would ask the High Representative: why is the EU negotiating membership with a country that is acting in such a bullying manner? Although, on second thoughts, the High Representative might agree that such a country would fit perfectly into the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I would like to give my thanks and congratulations to Mr Vaughan for this report as well as my commendation to him for becoming the King Canute of the 21st century, although King Canute would have had a much easier task in stemming the sea than the task of stemming the tide of EU expenditure. In the middle of an economic and financial crisis and ongoing national budget and consolidation efforts, the EU just does not want to see sense. It does not want to actually reverse expenditure but wants a freeze on inflation, which is probably still an increase. What we actually need is to withdraw expenditure and save taxpayers’ money. It needs to be by independent assessment. You have the daily allowances of EUR 304 and there will be a significant number of MEPs – and some MEPs I see in this place right now – who sign in on a Friday in Strasbourg when there is no official business, stealing taxpayers’ money. That should stop. Office allowances are only required to be 50% receipted. That should be 90% receipted and they should be independently audited, as mine is independently audited. If that money is not properly spent, it should be returned. The House of History is a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money that should be stopped. End this extravagance and return taxpayers’ money. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, on a point of order, in the previous debates on human rights, I had a timed speech and I also had a blue card, but you refused me a second blue card. But we had the previous speaker who had a timed speech and a blue card, and you also gave him a catch-the-eye. I would also note that the PPE Group here has had several catch-the-eye speakers, even though I was the very first person to make a request. You need to have equality here. If you talk about equality and democracy, at least give some pretence of it in this Chamber. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I am pleased to support any initiative that empowers and enables physically disadvantaged people, in this case, the blind and partially sighted. The EU has been, in my opinion, insensitive to the needs of millions of blind and partially-sighted people. All Member States and relevant institutions should make the strongest possible representations to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva in June for a full, binding treaty. This is the best way to ensure the fundamental right to read that is currently denied to far too many – apparently 300 million worldwide. Put an end to this famine. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question.

 Mr President, I have a question for my colleague, a Danish Member, about the European financial transaction tax, which the Danish Prime Minister says they want to introduce very swiftly. Does he agree with the Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, Margrethe Vestager, who said it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, or maybe he may agree with Lene Espersen, the former Danish Foreign Minister, who described the tax as ‘bullshit’? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, the Prime Minister is taking on the Presidency of the EU at a time when unacceptable behaviour threatens democratic principles. Such behaviour has become endemic and institutionalised in the European Union. In recent months we have seen elected leaders being bullied out of office and replaced by unelected technocrats, by an over-dominant German leader and her French poodle. With a possible new treaty on the way, the EU apparatchiks are desperately looking for a new way to include all 27 countries without the need for a referendum. So much for democracy. No wonder people across Europe are rioting. The message is there for all to see, but the EU turns its head away. Prime Minister, you again hold the Presidency at a decisive moment: the possible demise of the euro. At a time of crisis and uncertainty the EU is looking to the Danish Presidency for a strong lead. How telling it is that a country from outside the eurozone is taking the helm. The EU is looking to the IMF to help bail out the troubled euro. How telling it is that the UK, a country from outside the eurozone, ridiculed and threatened here in December, has been asked to prop up the IMF at this time. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, it has come to my attention that there is an increasing trend with regard to written declarations in this Parliament for children to be used.

 Madam President, I have grave concerns about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and I voted against this report. I have looked at the history of this report and noticed that the French car firms in particular, both Renault and Peugeot, as well as Dutch companies and German companies are great recipients of this for people they have made redundant. I am minded of my own constituents in Coventry, the Peugeot Ryton plant, where over 2 000 people were made redundant in 2007 without receiving any assistance or training whatsover. Indeed the Labour government or the current Conservative-led government in the UK has made no claims or put anything into retraining these people or other people whatsoever. There was also this week an EGF in favour of the Südtirol region of Italy, where the Member here, Mr Dorfmann, says that unemployment is just 3%. Yet we gave EUR 3.9 million to that project. Why? Why are we not training people where we do have serious unemployment but just throwing money away to a region where unemployment is only 3%? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, you, I and the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, are, according to Ms Sargentini, from the ‘plus one’. Well, let us hope that is ‘minus one’, and according to most of this Chamber, you will probably be most happy. I welcome the strong approach taken in this report; it is right and proper that transparency is given its correct importance. I am unsurprised by Mr Cashman wanting this because for the pro-Europeans in the UK, it is becoming a much more difficult job trying to sell the European Union and the secrecy of the European Union: its unaudited accounts or unsuccessfully audited accounts have, for many years, been a difficult sell within the UK. Something will need to be done. I would point out that it was the Labour government who brought in the Freedom of Information Act in 1997 in the UK and it ultimately caused them a lot of problems. I am unsurprised that they are hoping to put the Conservative Party in a difficult position in the Council, although they were very disingenuous when they were in power. I do sound a note of caution though on what I hear from the Commission, which is that they have no intention of being transparent, nor does the EPP when they are talking about undermining institutions and about a legitimate report. Who will decide what a legitimate report is? They will never allow transparency because they do not want it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague, who mentions the deplorable conditions in some EU detention centres, whether she would join my colleague, the Earl of Dartmouth, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Today, we have applauded with a standing ovation the Sakharov Prize. How can we talk about human rights in one vein, and be very sanctimonious and supportive of it, when, in the European Union itself, we have detention standards that are below common decency for human beings? Will she join me, and everyone else, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, I think Mr Murphy has summed this up perfectly; he talks about words and actions and that is what lies before us here. That is the decision that we have to make, or the Commission has to make. This is a question of values and puts into sharp focus Baroness Ashton’s assertion yesterday that human rights will be a thread in all the EU does. As has been said many times here, Uzbekistan is the third largest exporter of cotton worldwide; almost half that cotton is picked by state-sponsored forced child labour. Children suffer appalling conditions during the cotton harvest. Many contract hepatitis from insanitary conditions, and there have even been reports of police throwing stones at children who were not picking cotton because they were sick. So far, the European Union has failed to take action on this issue, but it is clear from all parts of this Chamber that this is an issue of importance that needs immediate attention. I would like to see a plan from the Commission, not rhetoric. Suspension of GSP would be a good start. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I sympathise with my Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues. They are right that there is no European consistency or social cohesion in this matter, but this is a flaw within the EU. Yes, there is discrimination, but fairness has different sides. My constituency of the West Midlands in the UK – and the UK has been mentioned, along with the Netherlands, as one of the countries that wants to prolong this exclusion – has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. We need to provide jobs for those people. When the first wave of Eastern bloc countries joined the European Union, the UK was one of the very few countries that did not impose restrictions, and the then Labour government said that 14 000 people from Poland and elsewhere would come into the UK. That 14 000 turned into over 850 000. That put an extreme demand on our social services: on our social housing, on our National Health Service and on our social security. The British taxpayer simply could not afford it. Earlier today, we heard the United Kingdom being called ‘26 plus one’. Well, it has the right to defend its own borders and to defend its own economy. We will remain that ‘plus one’ and, hopefully, will soon not even be that ‘plus one’ and will be leaving. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Vigenin for his question. Yes, of course, they are taxpayers, but what we are talking about here is the fact that, while they were paying tax, there was a British person who was unemployed because that job was taken, so that was a strain on our social security system. The United Kingdom is, simply, a small island. It is not about race, it is about space: we simply do not have enough jobs. I would like to see a points system in the United Kingdom, whereby we have people from outside the European Union and people from within the European Union as well, so that we can fill the vacancies we actually have. There is no point bringing workers in from around the European Union when we simply do not have the jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card answer. 
– Madam President, I do not have the statistics to hand but I have read several reports since 2005 and it is there for people to see in the United Kingdom. We can see this. We could see in 2006 and 2007 the demand on social housing, the demand on our health service and the demand on social security. Child benefit is paid for every child in the UK, and there were examples of workers from Eastern bloc countries claiming this money for children still resident in the Eastern bloc. That was the demand on British taxpayers. There is obviously an economic benefit from migrant workers to the UK. The UK has benefited from migration since the Second World War, from our own old Empire and Commonwealth countries. We need a certain level of immigration, but it needs to be controlled immigration under our terms, not your terms. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Ms Ţicău, you mentioned that we are either in this or out of this, but the Treaty of Rome actually says that for any kind of changes, especially to any Treaties, you need unanimity. But the European Union changes the rules as it goes along do you not? The British Prime Minister vetoed a new treaty last week, but you are going ahead with the rest of the 26 of you. Where does unanimity come in there? There are rules when they suit you and rules when they do not suit you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I was in Afghanistan less than three weeks’ ago, in Helmand Province, visiting the British forces that are part of the International Security Assistance Force or ISAF. It is an interesting situation there, and there are many fears for post-2014, but since the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, there has been a 60% increase in health care provision, with infant mortality reduced by 20%. Education has increased – obviously including females – with 13 000 more schools, 170 000 more teachers and 7.3 million more students. These are things that we need to build on. I am glad – amazed actually – that the European Parliament is having this debate here tonight and actually showing some concern about where the money goes. This makes a welcome change from previous years. We must continue to help Afghanistan build, because it was a factory of terrorism. The UK, other Member States and the international community need to show faith with Afghanistan to build a strong and prosperous country that rejects terrorism and all the disasters that go with it.

– Mr President, Mr Cameron stated in Westminster yesterday that only two options confronted him at last week’s summit: a new treaty without the negotiated safeguards for Britain or no treaty at all. He rightly chose no treaty. But with this failure, he left his and the Conservative Party’s EU policy in tatters. He mistakenly and naively promised the British people that he could repatriate powers from the EU, and that he could safeguard British interests. But such negotiations are not possible with the European Union, a Union that blatantly and negligently disregards sensible economic rules. You even broke your own rules in the Maastricht criteria just so that your beloved political project of European federalisation could move one step further. In your negligent actions, you cause financial hardship for people across Europe, people you constantly ignore in referendums. You deny them even the opportunity to have their say. To protect our interests, my country was right not to go along with your economic negligence. Even Ms Harms said that the summit denied reality and denied democracy. The British Prime Minister, having had his electoral pledge on renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU undermined and discredited, has finally faced up to the inevitable by refusing to have any part in the latest doomed rescue plan. Mr Cameron’s EU policy of negotiation is now in tatters and only a referendum on Britain’s future membership of the EU is a viable solution. Democratic integrity demands nothing less. The British people demand nothing less. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, as Ms Willmott knows, I am no big fan of Mr Cameron, but I think it is very disingenuous for a Labour politician to come here after 13 years of a Labour government where you deceived and distorted the European issue to the British people. You promised referendum after referendum but you failed to deliver one and called it whatever you wanted in order not to have it. I think Mr Cameron has to deal with the mess of 13 years of Labour policy towards the EU. But here is my question. You mentioned about the Labour Party supporting the European Union but we have a party in government, the Liberal Democrats, that is actually currently supporting the Conservatives. Will you then call for the Liberal Democrats to withdraw from the coalition and force a general election so that we can have a proper debate on the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I rise under Rule 173. I wonder, do you share my concern at the level of xenophobia that was experienced in this Chamber this morning towards Britain? It is an absolute disgrace. A chair of a group, Mr Verhofstadt, and I quote, said, ‘when you are invited to dinner, you are either invited as a guest or as a main course’. Could he explain whether that was a threat and what did he mean exactly by that comment? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the title ‘Fourth Railway Package’ really says it all for me, and that is that the EU is just no good at overseeing the railways of Europe.  UKIP, my party, has been voting against this so-called harmonisation for 15 years now, because we know it is difficult in the UK. We have a Victorian network, the oldest in the world, but quite why Brussels needs to harmonise the trains of the UK, which is an island, with the rest of the continent, is anyone’s guess. HS1 and the Channel Tunnel were financial disasters, with shares crashing and people losing huge amounts of money. But now we have HS2, because the European Union tells us we have to do so.  In 2002 the EU took the British Government to court because we were failing to fulfil our obligations under the Trans-European rail system Directive and now we have High Speed Rail 2 (HS2). The EU-sponsored HS2 will be costly, pointless and unfair, because it will punish the many to benefit the few, and I guarantee that those few will be the rich few.  If HS2 were such a good idea, then the business community would come up with the money, but of course they will not because they know it is just another expensive EU vanity project. Therefore the bill for this drive for harmonisation will fall on the British taxpayer and that, I believe – and my party believes – is grossly unfair, unneeded, unwanted, and that is why we are committed to scrapping HS2.

 Mr President, late last year, I brought up in this Chamber the case of a British ski instructor called Simon Butler. Mr Butler is trying to ply his trade in France at the moment, but he is being hounded by the French authorities, who claim that his qualifications do not meet their requirements, which is blatantly untrue and they know it.  I finished my speech by asking for a meeting with Commissioner Barnier to clear up this matter, which he kindly agreed to. On 20 January, Mr Butler and I met the Commissioner, and Mr Butler now has a memorandum of understanding from Commissioner Barnier, which should mean that he can ply his trade without trouble, without problems and without being harangued and harassed by the French authorities. So you can understand why we were a bit shocked last week when Mr Butler was locked up in a cell for 36 hours for absolutely no reason. It just goes to show that it is a farce. We in Britain stick to the rules and we comply with the single market, but the French do not. It is a disgrace. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, for the first time in my life I must congratulate the rapporteur. I know that this seems surreal coming from a member of UKIP, but I really do think that my British colleague is on to something here. Work permits, rights of residence: seems perfectly good stuff to me. In fact it sounds like the UKIP manifesto. However, where the report falls down is that these sensible proposals only apply to third-country nationals who want to come to the EU for seasonal work.  My proposal is that it should apply to all citizens within the EU but, sadly, EU freedom of movement, which is supported by all the British political parties except my own, prevents this from happening. At the moment in the UK we have 2.4 million people unemployed. That is less than some of the other countries within the EU, but it is still an appalling statistic. Indeed, worryingly, we have 20% youth unemployment and in some parts of my constituency, such as Salford, it is running at up to 40%. Many of these young people cannot find jobs because the employment market has been saturated by a huge influx of Eastern European workers who are prepared to work for less money.   The way to solve this problem is by applying Mr Moraes’ report to the whole of the EU, and then we can get back to controlling our own borders. But of course his own party, the Labour Party, would never support this. The European elections which are coming later this year are going to be dominated by the issue of immigration, and I am happy to say that my party, UKIP, is the only political party in Britain which has a firm, but fair, sensible policy in this area. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

Madam President, the civil protection mechanism means in effect civil protection money, but the European Union does not have any money; it belongs to the nation states. What the EU is doing is taking money from Member States and then handing it back, repackaged as the European Union. This is taking with one hand and giving with the other. It is little more than kidology. This is a desperate effort to get the citizens of Europe to love the European Union at a time when its popularity has hit rock bottom.  I am not opposed to helping out people who need help in times of natural disasters – fires, floods and earthquakes can completely wreck societies. We have seen this recently in the Philippines, where the aid has come in. Look at what the British have done: the UK Government has given GBP 60 million, provided planes, helicopters and ships, and the British people have provided GBP 70 million in donations. So this is proof that we already give aid when natural disasters occur. What we do not have to do is to filter it through the European Union for the EU to use as propaganda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, well we have finally made it, haven’t we? Agonising negotiations, budget cuts, budgets rises, tears, tantrums and vetoes that never were. So what are we left with? Well, we are left in the UK with us paying GBP 53 million a day into an organisation that has not had its accounts signed off for 19 years! So no change there then.  The EU has even tried to hide the bad press. Mr Van Rompuy threatened the Court of Auditors to give the accounts a clean bill of health. But even then there were more errors, so that means even more taxpayers’ money lost for ever. Last month we had an emergency vote to raise EUR 2.7 billion or, we were told, the EU would shut down like the USA. Of course, our friends the Conservatives did not even have the bottle to vote against this, and abstained, in another stunning victory for Mr Cameron: whilst we have cuts at home, more money for the European Union.  Do not be fooled by this agreement: it is merely papering over the cracks. Because next year the dam will burst at the European elections and in my country UKIP will be riding on the crest of an anti-EU wave. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, we frequently hear that the EU gives us the right to live and work in other countries, but allow me to tell you about Simon Butler, a British ski instructor who was arrested, handcuffed, and dragged off the slopes in front of his class as if he were a common criminal. Had he committed a crime? No. His only crime was that the French did not think his qualifications were good enough. We are talking about a man who easily qualifies as a UK instructor, so why were his qualifications not recognised? This is unfair. We are not talking about a criminal: we are talking about a law-abiding citizen whom the French ski and police authorities clearly want to victimise. I have asked Commissioner Barnier to meet me and discuss this issue and I await his response. Paul Nuttall,

Mr President, unlike many people in this Chamber I have actually been to a Roma camp in Bulgaria. That is me in a place called Fakulteta, which has up to 50 000 people living in slums in a square mile. And I saw conditions there of poverty and deprivation that one rarely sees outside sub-Saharan Africa. If I were forced to live like this, and you were forced to live this, you would seize any chance to leave, and that is what many will do on 1 January next year and many will be headed to the UK.  Some are coming to do honest work, we know that, but some will not. Sadly there are gangmasters within the Roma community who force children to work as everything such as pickpockets and prostitutes. This is already happening in other European countries and in January it will happen in the UK as well. So, centuries after social reformers in Britain stopped child prostitution and put a stop to Dickensian pickpocket gangs, the EU will foist them upon us once again.  There will be a backlash, trust me, and our government will not and cannot do anything about it because of the European Union’s laws. The best way, I believe, to help these people is not to export them round Europe: it is for their own national governments to do what our people did a long time ago and take the fight to child abusers who force them to work as career criminals.

Of course I think this obligation is completely wrong. We have 22 % of our own young people in the UK out of work. That is a million people unemployed. All that will happen when we open up the borders on 1 January 2014 to 29 million more people is that they will saturate the job market. It is about economics, it is nothing to do with racism and, quite frankly, we are only a small island and we cannot cope as it is. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -   
Madam President, I think the last debate on the subject of the Roma people really sums up why we are in the situation whereby extremism is on the march. People like the unelected Commissioner here just live on another planet. They are out of touch with public opinion. Your two flagship policies – the single currency and open borders – are creating a perfect breeding ground for the far right. Take Greece for example. The result of them being trapped in a catastrophic currency union has led to the rise of Golden Dawn. The austerity measures imposed by the European Union have driven large numbers of people in the cradle of democracy into the arms of extremists. Yet you still do not listen. If you want to know why the far right are on the march right across Europe, Commissioner, you have to do nothing else but look in the mirror. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, usually when I get up and criticise EU directives I can see a logic to them. It is usually a twisted and bad logic, but there is still a logic. There are a number of areas in this report which I believe actually defy logic. Firstly, the banning of tens. To me it makes no sense. You are not going to stop people smoking by banning 10 cigarettes. What you are going to do is encourage them to buy 20. So in effect what we are doing is, we are criticising places like McDonalds for supersizing their product but we are encouraging the tobacco industry to do the same. And all it will do is make poor people poorer. As regards the menthol cigarettes issue, a million people in the UK smoke menthol cigarettes. They are not going to stop overnight if you ban them, they will go to conventional cigarettes and you will increase the size of the black market.  Finally, e-cigarettes: e-cigarettes are proving, according to latest research, to be the most effective way of stopping people from smoking. Therefore, why on earth would you make them medicinal? Why would you make it harder to stop people smoking? I would ask my colleagues please to vote against this. It is ill-thought out, it is counterproductive and it is contradictory. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, this Directive might sound dull, but it boasts that it is the jewel in the crown of EU environmental policy. Now if any phrase should send a shiver down everyone’s spine, it’s that. It is massive. It rules 200 types of projects – everything from building bridges to new motorways, to rearing pigs and rearing poultry – and, strangely, the same document also admits that it gives rise to a large number of disputes. Well, that is not surprising because who among us really enjoys red tape when it gets in the way of our own lives?  Now it is the turn of shale gas. Everything must be regulated and nothing must escape. Well, in the North-West of England, we are sitting on possibly the biggest deposits of shale in the whole of Europe and all we want is to be left alone to move on and frack, to produce shale, as what it will do is give us cheap energy and a boom in jobs. Paul Nuttall,

 Madam President, in southern Europe we hear horror stories of 60% youth unemployment in Greece and Spain. In my own country we have a million young people out of work. Why is this happening? It is happening because EU rules and regulations on employers are making it difficult and expensive for them to hire young people. That is one point, but let us talk about the real elephant in the room here. The other problem is the fact that we have been forced to open our borders to 500 million people across the European Union. They have every right to come and work in the UK, to undercut young people and drive down wages. In a few months’ time, on 1 January 2014, we will be opening our borders to 29 million more people from Romania and Bulgaria, two countries which are far poorer than the UK. Already statistics are showing that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has risen by 26% this year. So here we are, debating the EU strategy. Well, I can tell you it is a failure and will continue to be a failure until the European Union allows us to implement sensible border controls. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

Mr President, the EU is finally coming to its senses about biofuels and reversing its policies. Hopefully, it will not be too little, too late. My party, UKIP, has opposed since day one subsidies for crops that grow oil rapeseed for biofuel instead of wheat for bread. It is practically taking food off the plate and putting it into the petrol tank. The EU is seeking to cut subsidies for biofuel. We in UKIP would like to see them abolished altogether. What we want is to end this ugly spectacle of farmers reaping subsidies instead of food crops. The price of food in Manchester in my constituency goes up and the price of food in Morocco and Mozambique also goes up, all because of the EU’s wrong-minded policies. A report by the EU Joint Research Centre shows that the price of vegetable oil and other foods would be halved in Europe if we ended biofuels and had no subsidies. These subsidies are the hard-earned taxes of the UK taxpayer. We would all rather keep that cash in our pockets rather than throw it away on biofuel subsidies. Now here is the real point. Many say that this is all in aid of fighting so-called global warming due to man-made carbon emissions. This is increasingly discredited as a climate theory. Figures only released this week show that the world has not warmed for 20 years. Indeed, only in this year the Arctic ice cap has increased by 60%, which proves that it is as likely to grow as it is to shrink. So let us just admit it. EU biofuels and the subsidies are all about buying farmers’ votes and wielding power. They are not about putting power in fuel tanks at all.

Mr Ashworth, you have not listened to me or else you are partially hard of hearing. I did not say we are going to outlaw anything: I said we should do away with subsidies. Quite frankly, this is British taxpayers’ money. This is pushing up the price of food and it is wrong. We are in the middle of a recession and I put it to you that I would rather the price of food be reduced than line the pockets of rich farmers in the UK – and actually not just the UK but right across Europe. Biofuels are a failed experiment. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, Commissioner. This food legislation, known in the trade as Parnuts, is fortunately not as dangerous as it sounds. A year ago, UKIP voted to repeal the amendment of sports nutrition supplements from the scope of this regulation, and for once we were successful. A bit less power for the European Commission and all its unnecessary quangos is the way that we see it.  Naturally, this small victory for common sense was not based on the Commission or the Environment Committee scaling back their ambition, but on the successful lobbying of ESSNA, a small but dynamic alliance of sports nutrition companies made up of two dozen small but innovative companies – primarily from the UK – which export sports drinks and protein bars. It was the culmination of years of handiwork on their part. It is nice to reward such efforts and win a vote – even such a small vote. However, I would prefer this legislation to be made at national level. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, on the face of it, and listening to this debate, I must say that shale gas is probably the most exciting development in the sphere of energy since the discovery of North Sea oil. It will benefit my own region in particular because we in the North West of England are sitting on 4.6 trillion cubic feet of shale, which means that we have the largest shale reserves in Europe. This could provide energy for the UK for up to 50 years and create tens of thousands of jobs in the North West of England. We also know from evidence in the United States that shale gas can reduce energy prices by up to 30%, which would be a welcome break for hard-working people in the UK in a time of recession. Lastly, shale gas can also provide us with much-needed energy security, because we can become more self-sufficient and not so reliant on the Middle East and Russia for our energy supply. Shale gas would bring more jobs, cheaper energy prices and energy security. To me it seems obvious that shale must form a central part of any of our future energy policies.

 Let us not call them earthquakes because they are not. They are tiny tremors, so let us have none of this green nonsense trying to blow things up and create scare stories. In May this year a government-appointed panel said that fracking is safe in the UK and we can move ahead with stricter legislation. In July the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineers also said that it will not contaminate water supplies, so there is an answer straight to your question.

– Mr President, I must congratulate our colleague on coming round to the UKIP position. We have been saying for many years now that Greece would be better off leaving the euro and going back to the drachma. But this is not the position of his government and it is certainly not the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Does my colleague agree or disagree with the position of the British Government? Does he agree with the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that more fiscal union is needed and that Greece would be better off in the euro, or is his position completely different from that of his own government? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Madam President, figures show that the pay gap between men and women is still large. After all these years of EU gender equality regulations, targets, and initiatives, the situation is still pretty poor. And now you want to introduce quotas for women in boardrooms. To be perfectly honest, when I read it, I did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Because, if a women is dedicated and good she can get to the top. Did Margaret Thatcher need quotas to become the British Prime Minister? No, she did not. She did it based on raw ability, an iron will and because she was the best person for the job. When you bring in quotas you lessen quality. You promote mediocrity and I contend that businesses should have the right to hire the best person for the job and it should not matter whether they are male, female, black or white or anything else. It is called a meritocracy and it is something which Britain and the English-speaking peoples of the world have been pioneering for centuries. How would you feel, if you were a women who had worked very hard and had gone into management, only for a token woman to be handed a similar job? If anything, this will create a culture of discrimination. As colleagues will constantly ask, did you get there because you are good or did you get there because you ticked a few boxes? You call this positive discrimination. I contend that discrimination is never positive. So here we have it. In a desperate bid to sound popular you are not only patronising women, you are promoting mediocrity and you are hampering business. I would urge all Members to vote against this report tomorrow.

 If a woman is good enough, she will be promoted. It is as simple as that. What we should have is a situation where we are not hampering business with regulation in times of austerity. What we should be doing is ripping up red tape and allowing businesses to hire the best person for the job, not introducing even more ‘big state’ legislation and tying the hands of businesses. No, let us do the opposite. Let us deregulate and let us ensure that the best person for the job gets it, regardless of gender, colour, creed, religion or anything else. The best person should always get the job. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 No I would not; but I would not say that women would probably do a better job. Hang on – the greatest monarchs that we have ever had in our country have been women. Undoubtedly! Probably our greatest Prime Minister of the last century was a woman. It is as simple as that. But she got there – and the Labour Party probably does not like that fact, but there we are – purely on merit because she was the best person for the job. I tell you that, if you go down this line, all you are doing is tying the hands of businesses in times of austerity. It is wrong! You should deregulate. You should do away with red tape and give businesses the freedom to hire the people they want. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commission intends to impose a new interpretation of the weight and dimensions of HGVs to allow for cross-border traffic of mega trucks. This measure would allow mega trucks into the UK through the back door because in the end the government will surrender to a ruling on competition grounds. In making this decision, no research to assess the safety, congestion and pollution impact has been taken. In 2009 the Commission stated that mega trucks are more dangerous than standard HGVs. The Commission is not even waiting to analyse the public consultation, which only closed in February. Of course the Commission interpretation will become a minimum standard and so lorries could get bigger, even beyond the 25 metres. This will surely have a massive impact on safety and cost to the British taxpayer. For example, how many bridges up and down the country in the UK will have to be reinforced to accommodate these heavier loads? This just shows you the power that these unelected EU Commissioners have. No one voted for them, and yet they can make unilateral decisions, off the cuff, which will affect local areas and businesses right across the UK. Paul Nuttall,

– 
Mr President, this is essentially a commercial problem, and if action is needed, then it is a situation crying out to be addressed by the private sector acting in its own commercial interests, under the law. But instead we get this report, which has all the hallmarks of everything which is worst about the EU and the Commission in particular, because it is going to be done using taxpayers’ money. I thought there was a crisis on. I thought we were living in a time of austerity necessitated by excessive government debt but, as ever, the taxpayer will be required to provide money that he or she can ill afford. The Commission likes to pretend that this will not require any extra resources, but I am more likely to believe that a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. We are creating and extending a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies always set out to justify themselves by showing both the massive scale of the problem and the need for more complex solutions. You can see it in this report and in the proposed legislation. It states facts which can only be conjecture. It is telling that you cannot be precise, or even necessarily in the right ballpark, when assessing grey economic activity. I do not see any proof that this new extension of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will either save EUR 10 billion or 185 000 jobs, yet that is the claim. To paraphrase Mandy Rice-Davies, ‘they would say that, wouldn’t they?’ Before I could back any of the proposals such as this, I would require some kind of guarantee that this would work and save the taxpayer money. I do not want to be unkind, but is it not nice for the office to be put in Alicante? You would think that an office like this would be put in an established commercial centre or a place associated with innovation, entrepreneurship and growth, but it is placed on the Costa Blanca. It reminds me of the famous song ‘Oh we do like to live beside the seaside, oh we do like to live beside the sea’ because – come on, let us get real – we are once again seeing taxpayers’ money being thrown at ‘jobs for the boys’ corporatism. Where is the evidence for European consumers and taxpayers that they will be better off? That would be a real impact assessment, not the usual Commission approach of assuming what it seeks to prove. What we have here is the usual manifestation of the Commission’s proposals, because it will be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It will never, ever, be brought in at a saving to the taxpayer. It will become eventually, as all these things always do, another bureaucratic monster. It is no more than a proto-agency right now but, as ever, it will grow and it will grow. I predict that, sitting there by the Costa Brava beach, the office and its lucky bureaucrats will become bloated on sun, sangria and paella. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, paragraph 100 of this report clearly states that you would like to see the EU flag at major sporting events and on the jerseys of athletes. Are we now going to see the EU flag at the British Olympics, at the Champions League Final or even on the shirt of the England captain? This is nothing more than sheer EU propaganda and vanity. The EU has never been so unpopular, yet here you are, wanting to stamp your flag on sporting stars in the hope that you can force the people to love you. But they will not. What you propose also seems to break the rules of sporting competitions. For example, under Law 4, Decision 1 of the FIFA laws of the game, it states: ‘The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or FIFA.’ What right do you think the EU has to interfere in sport in such a way to encourage countries to break the rules? It is hypocritical, because the EU is in effect a political organisation. You even say in paragraph 20 of the report that political propaganda should be banned, which is hypocritical. Athletes proudly wear the flag of their own national countries. They should not wear the flag of the European Union.

Mr President, I would like to agree with my colleague. The EU is not a country; the EU is a false state. What is being created is something very dangerous, because false states like the Soviet Union only ever break up in one of two ways. They break up in peaceful divorce, like Czechoslovakia – which is the way in which I hope this organisation will break up – or in bloody revolution, like Yugoslavia – which I fear very much indeed. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the EU world view is that it knows best about everything, from global warming scare stories to food labels. But the truth is that it is the consumer who is paying and not the EU and the consumer will choose what he or she wants to eat. Of course, some kind of labelling is just common sense, whether it is nutritional information or allergies but I would suggest that much of this report is nannying in the excess. I also fear that it will come at a cost and that that cost will then be pushed onto the consumer, which seems to me to be particularly dangerous at a time of an economic downturn. But here is the crux and I repeat it in almost every speech I give. We all know that the UK can pass laws itself, indeed our parliament was known as the mother of parliaments for many years. This is a decision that should be taken at nation state level. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but, in my experience, that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation, because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it. Let us be frank. This is about – and I quote – ‘air emissions and environmental taxes’, just as the last speaker said. So the Sovietisation of the EU continues. The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and – let us be honest – you want this data to tax and control, which explains your thirst for ever more statistics. The worst thing of all is that this is a regulation, not a directive. Regulations are far worse than directives because they pass into UK law and bypass the UK Parliament. This is very dangerous and, my friends, this is the way democracy dies. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, let me make the first point. The fact of the matter is that this place likes to control things from the centre. Let us also make another point, that none of the Commissioners are actually elected by the people. Democracy matters for the whole of Europe so, yes, I do believe that we are seeing a Sovietisation of Europe. The fact of the matter is that these decisions should be taken at Member State level. The fact that regulations can bypass my own parliament, can bypass the people who were elected by the British people, is an absolute disgrace and, yes, it is the Sovietisation of Europe. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, my father is a small businessman. He owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the Conservative Prime Minister and true Eurosceptic, Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s. Like all small businessmen, he is overburdened with red tape and regulation – much of it emanating from this place, the European Parliament. My father’s small business remains small. However, these kinds of businesses are the bedrock of the British economy and they amount to a staggering 73% of all businesses in the UK. My father drives a van, and like many small businesses, he is struggling due to the recession. I have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father’s out of business for ever, because we are told that this legislation will, in fact, put up to EUR 5 000 on the price of vans. Small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife. The gentleman from the Socialists said that this is a good day for climate change policy in the EU. However, if this goes through, I guarantee it will be a bad day for small businessmen across the continent. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, again, this place shows absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in the real world. People are struggling out there, and what this legislation does – and it has been made quite clear to us – is put up the cost of small vans which are driven by many small businessmen across the continent. It will put it up by at least EUR 5 000. That is totally and utterly wrong, and it is something that we can ill afford in a time of recession. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, does the right honourable gentleman really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will, in effect, push up the cost of vehicles? He knows it will, and I know it will. In effect, what it will be doing is putting small firms in Liverpool and Manchester – in his own constituency – out of business. Does he think that is fair? Does he think it is morally correct? Is he prepared to stand on that platform in the elections in three years’ time? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Madam President, mobile phones, phone chargers, play stations, cameras, saunas, thermometers, refrigerators, freezers, toasters, kettles, microwaves, irons, air fresheners, clocks, watches, electric toothbrushes, DVD players, vacuum cleaners, children’s toys, video games, medical devices, televisions, remote controls, calculators, heaters, tumble dryers and washing machines. Well, that is just to name a few, because all of these appliances and many more will undoubtedly rise in price as a result of this waste directive. And to think that the European Union is prepared to pile this legislation on just at a time when we are in the depths of a recession and when people are struggling to make ends meet! I therefore encourage everyone in this Chamber to show sympathy with the hardworking taxpayers and with small-to-medium-sized businesses and put this prospective law in the waste bin. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I too enjoy my jousts with Mr Davies. It seems that we have these little jousts on every speech that I give. He knows as well as I do where the cost will lie – it will end up with the taxpayer having to fund this. At the moment, we are in the depths of a recession the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s. I am standing up for hardworking taxpayers. Secondly, the real point here is that this should be done at national level by people – by politicians – who are accountable to the electorate, not by a Commission that meets in secret and is accountable to nobody. That is the key. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, first of all I will repeat what I just said. We all know where the cost ends up – where it always does. It does not necessarily have to say it in the directive, because it never does. You never tell people that you are going to put up tax. You never tell people that you are going to hit them in the pocket. In my country, for example, it costs us GBP 50 million a day to be members of this club. The key to all of this is – and I go back to exactly what I said to Mr Davies – decisions should be made at nation-state level by politicians who are accountable to the electorate. The electorate of my country, Great Britain, cannot remove Commissioners. That is fundamentally undemocratic and wrong. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I support the protection of victims. However, when I first came across the European Protection Order, I thought it sounded scary, like the European Arrest Warrant, which, in my opinion, is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people. The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women. We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism – and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that. Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law. If proof were needed, we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant. I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK, for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life. We have a saying in England: ‘once bitten, twice shy’. We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant. I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I hope everyone enjoyed Cancún. It is a lovely place but I am a bit disappointed to see that none of them has a suntan. Well, I suppose that is to be expected really because, while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming, it was actually the coldest week that Mexican city had seen for over a hundred years. Back in the UK, we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest Novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming. Do these people think we were born yesterday? This also explains why even more British people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control. But what have you actually achieved in Cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers’ money in the guise of the Green Climate Fund, which I suggest will end up being a lucky bag for African dictators to buy themselves more Mercedes Benzes and private jets? Personally, I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed, and I think the ‘Politics of Envy Fund’ would be better and closer to the truth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You are giving the game away there, because what you are talking about is world governments, politicians. We are talking about scientists here. Science is a slow process, evidence has to be studied and deciphered, but politics is a quicker game and politics is running ahead of the science; that is where the problem lies. The fact of the matter is that the globe is actually not warming; it has not warmed since 1998. So the game is up, people are finding out that you have a problem. What you are doing is conning people; it is a scam and the people are finding you out. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

– Madam President, one of the totems of a sovereign state is that it controls who can and who cannot come into its own country. Unfortunately, several governments in the UK have given away this power to unelected, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels. What a disaster it has proven to be. We have a situation now where we have uncontrolled EU immigration into our country, which has resulted in wages being driven down and people – indigenous people – being put out of work. I do not believe that this EU immigration liaison officers’ network has any power to stop this happening at all. We also have a two-tier immigration system in our country whereby if you are from Australia or New Zealand or anywhere else, you have a cap. However, if you are from Latvia or Poland or any of the EU countries, you can come to our country willy-nilly. This is fundamentally wrong. It is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration, but what happens if a country like Romania, for example, basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants? What it does is it makes a mockery of the whole system. I support elected politicians in the UK having control over our own borders. What I do not support are unaccountable, unelected appointees. I believe that the strengthening of this network would not be necessary if each individual Member State had the power to control who does and who does not come onto its lands. I therefore implore everybody to reject this report. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, if doctors and dentists and people like that want to come to the UK to work – and we need their skills – then by all means they should come, but what we have at the moment is a situation where our market is saturated: we cannot control who comes from the EU and who does not. This is fundamentally wrong. It is bad and it is putting people out of work. I shall give you an example. The taxi driver who drove me to the airport this morning was a bricklayer who has been laid off as a result of Polish people coming onto the site, undercutting British workers, and now he is driving a taxi. That cannot be right. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, ‘biodiversity’ is a word I often hear bandied about by Eurocrats, MEPs and lobbyists out here in Brussels. But I wonder if anybody in here can actually define what it really means, because I bet my bottom dollar that none of you can. Oddly enough, I think it does matter that you understand what you are talking about if you are making laws for the whole of the EU. But what does the conveniently vague and ambiguous term ‘biodiversity’ actually mean? Because the truth of the matter is that there is no correct number of species, whether it is on a Cumbrian farm or a Liverpool suburb or even in a Cheshire forest, and I defy the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to come up with a proper definition or stop using such ragbag words. And, may I ask, where is the boundary of the biodiverse area? Is it ever applied to offshore marine environments? And if so, why are you so keen to build monstrous wind farms that are detrimental to wildlife and do not even work! Let us be frank, you have not got a clue. There is no clear thinking, no coherent policy and no logic to what you are proposing. If you are going to preach, which is what you are doing, look in the mirror first, sort your own house out and let us start with the disaster which is the common fisheries policy. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, let us put a few facts in order. If you want examples of species which are disappearing, there are a lot of dodgy statistics out there – take polar bears as an example. People constantly say that the polar bear population has fallen. Yet the polar bear population is actually bigger now than it was in the 1940s. I agree that species are disappearing, but I do not believe that the European Union – which is fundamentally undemocratic, the British people have never had a say on it – is the forum to decide this matter. It should be done in nation states. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– The amendment allows the many people in the EU, and the MEPs who represent them, to signal their unhappiness and opposition to Turkish membership and the concomitant political union. However, we do not want this to be at the expense of supporting free trade with Turkey – and without tariff barriers – so much of the report is unchanged. Many choices are invidious: free trade agreements allow tariff barriers. Customs unions eliminate them internally but continue to allow and even erect them externally. And, of course, customs unions limit and prohibit members’ freedom of commercial negotiation. Despite these concerns about customs unions as a concept, in the context of Turkey’s circumstances, we are accepting that part of the report’s content relating to the customs union because it allows those against full Turkish EU membership to register their vote. It should be noted that in the event, only 38 MEPs out of 736 put their vote against Turkey entering Political Union. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I must say that it is quite enthusing to see that there are so many MEPs who treat this place with the contempt I do. Out of the 736, there are fewer than 30 of them here – which is under five percent – and it is half four on a Tuesday afternoon. As usual, EU rules and regulations are running out of control. But that is nothing compared to the rats and mice that will run out of control when the EU takes away common rat poison from ordinary householders. This is what Amendment 243 of this report will do. This daft piece of legislation will ensure that only professionals will be allowed to put down rat poison, which is freely available in shops. So, if rats are in your front garden, spreading their diseases and chewing everything up, the ordinary UK householder will be forced to wait for the Council rat catcher or have to pay for Rentokil. We are already told that you are never further than 20 yards away from a rat in a city centre in the UK. This piece of crazy legislation will only make things worse. To put this into perspective, this is a piece of bureaucracy for a rat poison that has been safely used by ordinary folk for the past 30 years – not only in the UK, but across Europe and in the USA. I will finish by asking a question. Why are you doing this? Do you want more vermin? Do you want more disease? Or is it just about control and your obsession with trying to govern every single aspect of our lives? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to bring to this House’s attention a riddle which seems to be confusing MEPs from my own region in the North-West of England. In November 2009, Cumbria, which is in the northern part of my constituency, was hit by serious flooding. Homes were destroyed, businesses were ruined and sadly, a life was lost. As a result of the disaster, the British Government had every right to apply for the EU Solidarity Fund for assistance, and I am led to believe that the money which could have come in aid could have been up to GBP 100 million. Bizarrely, however, the British Government failed to apply. The people of Cumbria are honest folk. They work hard and they pay their taxes and a good portion of that is sent out to Brussels. Therefore, I believe that they have the right to ask for some of their money back, and I consider it a failure of the Labour Government that it failed to act on this issue. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I am increasingly concerned about the way local councils in my constituency in the North West of England are using car parking charges to top up their revenue. Take the small town of Congleton, for example, which is a local semi-rural community. The introduction of car parking charges will severely damage local industry and a fall-off in trade will result in a loss of revenue, forcing already hard-pressed SMEs into bankruptcy and possible closure. People are blaming the British Government, some blame the Unitary Council and others point the finger at the town council but, as always, the dark hand of the European Union lies in the background, for they are all working towards the framework set out in the EU’s European transport policy for 2010. You see, this is the genius of the EU: it is always one person removed. Whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections, the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of Brussels does not appear on the radar. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, please allow me to speak frankly as one Lancastrian to another, because this is not going very well, is it? It really is not. Earlier on, Baroness Ashton, you said that Europe needs a credible foreign policy. How can we have a credible foreign policy when it has an incredible High Representative? You seem as if you are stumbling from one crisis to another, so much so that the British Foreign Secretary had to write you a letter this week asking you to buck up, to get on your game. But we in UKIP were on to this from the start. We opposed your appointment because we said you would be clearly out of your depth – and we are being proved right. It was said that your appointment, made by the Commission, would stop the traffic in Tokyo and Washington. But you have not even been able to appoint the Ambassador to Washington because old Barroso did you up like a kipper! It is also claimed in the British press that you do not turn your phone on after 8 p.m. at night. But, Baroness Ashton, you are the highest-paid female politician in the world. You are paid more than Frau Merkel, you are paid more than Hillary Clinton: it is a 24-hour job. To top it all, yesterday it was reported that you are being provided with a Learjet. You are expected to do 300 000 miles per year. That would get you to the moon, and most people now would like you to stay there. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, contrary to the belief of the Commission, the debate regarding man-made climate change is far from over. In the past month alone, we have had the scandal of the University of East Anglia; then we have had the debacle over the Himalayan glaciers and now, we have got questions over the effect climate change will have on wildlife in the Amazon. Research has shown that at least 20 passages in the IPCC’s report cite non-peer-reviewed World Wildlife Fund or Greenpeace reports as authority. This is not science. We need solid, peer-reviewed scientific evidence, not the work of pressure groups using climate change to further their own agendas or politicians who use climate change to justify the existence of the European Union. I would like to ask whether it is now time to pause, to take stock and consider the ramifications of bounding ahead with policies that could damage economies, result in job losses or potentially result in energy chaos.

– While this report points to a rather less awful CFP than the monstrosity we have now, it nevertheless recommends leaving fisheries under the predatory control of the undemocratic and anti-democratic ‘European Union’, and, for this reason, cannot be endorsed by UKIP. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I requested to make this one-minute speech to highlight the terrible effect that fortnightly bin collections are having upon communities in my constituency in the north-west of England. Take my home town of Bootle, for example, where many families live in terraced houses with no front gardens and little space at the rear. It is crazy that they are forced to put out waste every two weeks. This, naturally, has caused pile-ups of rubbish, because there is no storage space. If we have a hot summer, you can be sure that this will lead to an increase in vermin, which in turn is a public health hazard. But why am I telling this House? Well, because fortnightly bin collections are the direct result of the EU’s Landfill Directive, which was supported in this Chamber by the British Labour Party and the Conservatives. I for one hope that a large number of British voters bear this in mind when they go to the polls in the general election later this year. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, may I first say that I have sympathy with the workers in Antwerp, but I would like to point out another couple of issues regarding the EU and General Motors. Spyker Cars becomes Saab Spyker in a EUR 400 million deal but, make no mistake, this is not a normal commercial deal where one company pays and another company is paid. This is a Commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy. Spyker pays, but using money from the European Investment Bank. In other words, the European taxpayer pays and the whole deal is underwritten by the Swedish Government. Of course, only the risk is underwritten. General Motors will still take a share of the profits and Saab Spyker will be obliged to buy fully assembled cars from another General Motors plant, one located in that well-known European nation of Mexico. Why are we saving jobs in Mexico with European taxpayers’ money? Can we not rebody Vectras at the Ellesmere Port plant in my constituency? For that is all Saab has been reduced to. And it is also common knowledge that General Motors and the European institutions have a special relationship. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pumped over EUR 160 million into General Motors’ operations in Russia and Ukraine, and it owns a 30% equity stake in the General Motors manufacturing plant in St Petersburg. So I would like to ask the Commission why such extravagant financial support is available to countries such as Ukraine and Mexico but is never available to British companies. Rover could have been saved for a fraction of the price, and jobs probably could have been saved at Rolls Royce in Netherton on Merseyside, in my constituency, but at the moment, General Motors jobs in my constituency in the north-west of England are still at risk and yet the Commission is using my constituents’ tax revenues to secure General Motors jobs in Mexico and Russia. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have recently heard that there is to be a closure of the Corus steel works on Teesside in northern England. This is due to an EU target reduction of 20% of carbon emissions. Thanks to the carbon credit, Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers, including suppliers. We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law. The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme, which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years. But surprise, surprise – guess what: the head of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, is also the head of the Tata Foundation, so, one must ask, cui bono
? Because Tata owns Corus. (Protests from the floor)
 The question I would like to ask is: is it now official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside so that they can outsource their business to countries such as India, or is there a more personal interest at stake here? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You did not answer my question, because the question was: is it official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside and outsource the business to countries such as India? You did not answer the question. Would you please answer it? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I have just heard a Socialist colleague over there talking about Greenland and the ice melting in Greenland. The question I would like to ask on this subject is: why is Greenland called Greenland? Is it perhaps because Greenland was once green when the world was hotter? It seems that the British people are onto this, because a recent opinion poll in The Times
 newspaper clearly shows that the British people no longer believe in so-called man-made global warming. The British people are very astute and they are clear that politicians have hijacked the environmentalist agenda. It is being cynically used to raise taxes, to exert control, and now it is being used by the European Union to justify its own existence. This week, we have also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate-research centres in the UK, which advises the government, being caught altering data and stifling debate. It is an absolute disgrace. I look forward to Copenhagen, when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room, which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past 10 years. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I would like to draw this assembly’s attention to the disastrous effect that the Biocides Directive is having across the UK. This punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine, which has been used to control the mole population in the UK for the past 70 years. This was the case until the EU got itself involved. As a result, mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate, which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business. But it gets worse. While strychnine kills a mole in up to 15 minutes, aluminium phosphate takes up to three days, ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death. This crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the UK, but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the UK is better off out. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union. The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or of my real parliament at Westminster. The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink. The people have been bypassed, but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people. Just take a look at what has happened with the Lisbon Treaty. It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue. They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee. To conclude, on the eve of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out all over Europe. Well done to the European Union, because, with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change, what you are doing is proving Sir Edward’s unfortunate prophecy to be correct. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. The Regulation restricts freedom of contract, grants powers to ESMA (including the power to prohibit investment products) and empowers the Commission to pass delegated acts and to adopt regulatory technical standards. Transparency in OTC dealings is all very well, but the volume of the information produced will be unmanageable within any reasonable time frame – rendering the process meaningless. EMIR regulates derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories in the European Union. The proposal creates new requirements to mitigate the risks associated with the derivatives markets, following the lessons from the financial crisis. It introduces new requirements for transparency, as well as organisational requirements and prudential standards for both CCPs and trade repositories. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This is a major piece of legislation, relating to financial services, and therefore has the potential to have a significant effect on the UK economy. The most fundamental change MiFID creates is to introduce competition into the EU trading landscape by providing a passport for trading venues and investment firms on the basis of authorisation in their home Member State.

 UKIP’s position is against. Extends the powers of the Commission. Has every appearance of a bland technical review aimed at improving existing flows of information. The Committee’s amendments appear sensible in the circumstances (and include reducing cost and protecting confidential information).

 Our position is against. The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the biggest household survey in Europe.

 Mr President, I was speaking today primarily not as a UKIP MEP but as a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales. One fact is beyond dispute: the Court of Auditors has not passed the accounts of the European Union for the last 19 years. This is even though the Court has only to sign off a declaration of assurance, which is probably a lessor standard than the true and fair view of the Anglo-American world. This, then, is the context: the context of 19 years of unsigned accounts, in which this Parliament is now discussing own resources – and the conclusion is clear. The institutions of the European Union are unreformable, otherwise they would have been reformed back in 1994 – the first time that the accountants did not pass the test of the Auditors. This is a disgrace, and I hope that the next Parliament will do something about it because for sure this Parliament will not. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 You mentioned in your remarks that we should look at the impact of climate change on flooding. Have you ever considered the impact and consequent causes of EU directives on flooding? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Madam President, my constituents in the area known as the Somerset levels have suffered badly from flooding. This flooding is in large part the direct consequence of EU directives, especially the EU directive on wildlife. Money has gone on wildlife habitats, and routine maintenance and dredging – which is highly necessary – has been barred. People in the Somerset levels are prime candidates to benefit from EU solidarity funding. They should get back some of the disproportionate amount that we in the UK are paying to the EU. However, the UK’s coalition government has not even applied. This is an appalling decision, and I therefore ask two questions. First, what use is the coalition government? – and second, what is the purpose of Britain remaining in the EU? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. Whilst there may be occasions when a Parliament might properly instigate and inquire into some matter, this Parliament is unlikely to do that effectively. There have hitherto been only two or three inquiries (one, which was somewhat unsatisfactory, on the Equitable Life business).

 UKIP’s position is: against. The SRM, which complements the single supervisory mechanism (SSM), is a pillar of Banking Union. It is designed to centralise control, authority and management over bank failures in the Eurozone (and other participating Member States – the ‘pre-ins’ such as Sweden). However, much of the drafting fails to make adequate distinction between the UK and the Eurozone, leaving room for judicial ‘interpretation’ to harmonise across the whole single/internal market – in fact the Committee amendments expressly encourage this. Moreover, Banking Union is against the long term interests of the Member States of the Eurozone as it perpetuates the euro as a job-destroying machine. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. This directive introduces rules relating to payment accounts, with a particular focus on transparency for fees, easier switching mechanisms and broader access to basic bank accounts. Many elements of this reform have already been in place in the UK for some time, and the UK’s prime objective in negotiations on this file was to ensure that key elements of its own system were preserved. Unnecessary harmonisation, over-regulation and interference in freedom of contract. The right to a bank account may sound beneficial but would be more easily delivered by abandoning the over-regulation resulting from anti-money laundering regulations. If, as HMG says, much of this is already in place, we don't need a further tier of regulation muddying the waters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. More ‘retail-friendly’ legislation designed to eliminate risk, without realising this also stifles innovation and adds cost without reward. The consumer is already adequately covered by existing legislation and by common law, so it would be better to focus energy on improving enforcement rather than fiddling with the rules to create unnecessary harmonisation for its own sake. This regulation creates a new Key Information Document (KID) to be produced by investment product manufacturers and provided to retail customers when they are considering buying investment products. The negotiations centred on the appropriate content and length of the KID, as well as to which products it would apply. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This Regulation establishes a EU procedure for a protective measure which enables a creditor to obtain a European Account Preservation Order (‘EAPO’) preventing the withdrawal or transfer of funds held by the debtor in a bank account within the Union. The EAPO will be available to the creditor as an alternative to protective measures existing under national law in the Member States. This is an unnecessary piece of legislation.

They want to make large companies jump through hoops by providing huge amounts of further information to the public. As regards matters relating to reporting, a new recital sets out the main issues to be reported on. Environmental information, for instance, will have to include greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and the use of renewable energy. With reference to social and staff-related matters, the information should concern, amongst other things, the implementation of fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, working conditions and social dialogue. Information relating to human rights and the fight against corruption, however, will have to include at least data concerning the prevention of human rights infringements and explanations as to the tools used by the undertaking to combat corruption and bribery.

 Mr President, I am going to focus on paragraph 46 of the report. This says, and I quote, ‘an EU seat in an enlarged UN Security Council remains a central, long-term goal of the European Union’. Later, it calls for – and I quote again – ‘the introduction of new members of the UN Security Council and reform of the UN Security Council’s decision-making towards the possible use of a super-qualified majority’. In the European Union, the United Kingdom has very little influence. We have just 8.24[nbsp ]% of the weighted votes in the Council of Ministers, less than 10[nbsp ]% of MEPs and the ability to appoint just one of 28 Commissioners. However, the UK is represented in its own right in international organisations. Perhaps the most significant is the UK’s permanent seat on the UN Security Council and the veto that goes with it. This report, and the thinking behind it, puts at risk the UK’s seat on the UN Security Council and also the UK’s veto. Let us be crystal clear. The UK’s continuing membership of the European Union does not enhance our influence in the world. It is in fact exactly the other way round. Our influence is thereby, and inevitably, diminished.

 With the greatest possible respect you actually got it wrong. There is a seat on the UN Security Council. That seat has a veto. What the report proposes is that the EU should have a seat. It also proposes that the method of voting, and I quote, ‘should make use of a super-qualified majority’, which would have the effect of losing the veto. So, therefore, it diminishes the position of the UK and, incidentally, of France, on two counts, not just one.

 Mr Ashworth, first of all I should like to thank you for accepting my question. Your party, the British Conservative Party, is a vociferous supporter of – it may even be said to be a cheerleader for – the entry of Turkey into the European Union. Turkey is getting pre-accession funding of about EUR[nbsp ]900 million a year, which is planned to continue for another six years. How does your party’s support for Turkey sit alongside your two principles of limited funding and value for money? I look forward to your answer. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I am just going to address one item in the budget, and that is the instrument for pre-accession funding. In seven years from 2014, the European Union has budgeted over EUR[nbsp ]14 billion to be paid to countries who are not EU Member States. These countries get the money because they are candidate countries. They are a former Yugoslav Republic, Iceland, Montenegro, and the one that gets the most money: Turkey. And Turkey especially will cost us even more in cohesion funds should it become a Member State. Bizarrely, the establishment parties in the UK are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the European Union. And let me be crystal clear: any political party that supports, let alone vociferously supports, Turkey’s candidacy can have no credibility when it comes to controlling, let alone cutting, the vast and wasteful EU budget.

 Thank you for taking the question. Mr Lambsdorff, you mentioned the word ‘freedoms’ in your speech. Now, should Turkey obtain freedom of movement, what is your careful estimate of the number of Turkish citizens who will emigrate from Turkey to northern Europe, in particular to Germany and the UK? And to help you with your response, it is estimated that the population of Turkey in 2025 will be 90 million. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Madam President, geographically, Turkey is 97% in Asia. However, the Turkish Government’s attitude to dissent places it 100% in the Middle East. There is – like in Cuba – a bill to curb internet freedom. The Justice Minister has powers to appoint and discipline judges and prosecutors. Worst of all, currently there are 40 journalists in prison in Turkey. The Commissioner, in his arrogant self-absorption, said that he had spoken to the Turks about this. They are clearly not paying any attention to the Commissioner at all. In Turkey there is a subjugation of the media, the judiciary and civil society that is almost without precedent in a seeming democracy. To put it simply, Turkey does not subscribe to Western values. Turkey should be regarded as too big, too poor, too different and too authoritarian ever to become a member of the European Union. It is totally depressing that the establishment UK political parties are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the EU. They – and this House – should think again.

 One hundred and twenty years ago, the British Parliament passed the Sale of Goods Act. In 1979, that Act was re-enacted with minor amendments and it remains very much the same today.

The Act has stood the test of time because it is a model of brevity, clarity and simplicity. Now along comes the Commission, in its self-absorbed wisdom, proffering a common European sales law. Twice the length of the UK Sale of Goods Act, it is a minor masterpiece of legislative flatulence which will benefit only lawyers.

This has resulted in massive and unacceptable delays. Incidentally, the people who suffer are mostly Spanish citizens. Because of the problems at the land border, air travel becomes of prime importance. Attempts have been made, and are being made, by Members of this Parliament, by means of legislative devices, to suffocate air travel in and out of Gibraltar’s airport. This must not be.

 Mr President, of course we are all, in principle, against subsidised imports – that is dumping – and there has to be trade defence when trade counterparties decline to accept the principles that underpin free and open trade. But by trade defence we do not mean what happened when the otherwise distinguished EU Commissioner for Trade was happy to launch what might have become a full-scale trade war with China over the comparatively minor matter of solar panels. I have described this previously as a frolic. It also took place against the representations of 17 of the then 27 Member States. This report, in its essentials, gives greater scope, power and discretion to the Commission. Illegal dumping by third countries of course needs to be dealt with, but not by appointed trade officials acting on a whim. The European Union, in its beginnings and in its operations, is a protectionist construct. On open trade, it is simply not credible. In the context of dumping, the way forward is a sense of proportionality. That is how an independent Britain should handle this problem, and there will be an independent Britain sooner than most people think – and that ‘most people’ includes the President of Italy today.

Nevertheless, to give just one example, the European Union is now operating an incredible 140 embassies or equivalent, and this costs a lot. To make matters worse, the value of the salary package of up to 500 of the personnel is greater than that received by the British Prime Minister.

Mr President, Libya was the most recent conflict directly concerning Member States, and just 11 of the Member States supported the UN resolution.

What there is, is an EU Foreign Service – the External Action Service – apparently with 30 missions, and what that is, is a gigantic gravy train for EU insiders and their hangers-on. My amendment in June proposed that External Action Service personnel be restricted to ten weeks’ paid holiday a year. Just 84 MEPs voted in favour. This is shameful, and I hope it will be very different in the next Parliament. By the way, on a previous occasion, I have made it very clear how I regard the office and office-holder of the post of High Representative.

Mr President, as has been said, 26 Member States have individual bilateral investment agreements in force with China, and it would be a better use of everyone’s time if the Trade Commissioner dropped the attempt to negotiate an EU-China Investment Agreement and simply left it to the outstanding two, Latvia and Ireland, to negotiate their own agreement. But there is another vital point here. Switzerland has a trade agreement with China, New Zealand has a trade agreement with China, and in particular Iceland has a trade agreement with China. The fact is that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade bloc in order to sign trade agreements. Demonstrably, it is just not true.  Iceland, as most of us know, has now suspended its application for EU Membership. In my view, it is a very wise decision. In the context just of trade, were Iceland to join the EU, it would then be obliged to abandon the trade agreement it already has with China. And so, colleagues, the message for the UK is very clear.

Mr President, the EEAS is the EU’s Foreign Service. An EU Foreign Service is based on the assumption that there is a communality of interest among the 27 Member States. This is a fallacy. In Libya, only eight European countries took part, not 27, and one of them was not a member of the EU. The 27 Member States are – to coin a phrase – ‘a coalition of the unwilling’, and sometimes less than that. There is also the sheer wasteful cost of the EU’s Foreign Service. EEAS staff are very highly paid. Indeed, up to one hundred officials enjoy take-home pay that is more than that of Britain’s Foreign Secretary. The financial climate has the consequence that the UK is closing down embassies and consulates. Nonetheless, we are made to contribute – and to contribute very substantially – to the EU’s Foreign Service in order to advance a foreign policy that is not – I repeat not – ours. All of this – the EEAS – is a demonstration yet again that Britain’s membership of the EU in actuality diminishes our influence in the world. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

Ms Cornelissen, in the light of the points which you made in your speech, how do you justify the very substantial sums of money paid to Bosnia and Herzegovina to your constituents, many of whom are struggling, as are most people in the European Union? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, Bosnia has an eye-watering unemployment rate of 43%. It is yet another very poor Eastern European country in line to join the EU. Once the door is open to Bosnia, there will be a massive outflow of people. The UK will then be a magnet. Back home, the British Conservative Party claims to be committed to reducing immigration. But, as we all know, that is an impossibility so long as we remain in the EU, and the impossibility is compounded as more countries get EU membership and their people in consequence have the right of free movement. It is simply breathtaking that the British Government and the Labour Party, none of whose representatives are here, can support – and support actively – Bosnia Herzegovina joining the EU.

Mr Rouček, I think with respect that you are missing the point. It is not very many at the moment, but that is precisely because we are able to have immigration controls. Should Bosnia-Herzegovina become a member of the European Union, we would then have no immigration controls, as you and your colleagues have said in this House many times – and, I regret to say it, with the support of the Commission.

 Madam President, my government, the British Government, recognises that the current legislation needs toughening up because of compromises, but is basically in favour. The rapporteur herself is unhappy with at least most of the amendments and is asking for a pass on the whole thing without the amendments. However, within that, the provision of services is already catered for because it is prohibited to prevent a worker in this situation, on grounds of residence or nationality, from working in another state by way of posting. The rapporteur’s latest brief emphasises workers’ rights when posted to another country, but surely that is a question of the national law of that country. If that is followed, why is there the need for extra legislation? Let the national law take care of it. But that brings me unfortunately to the dreadful business of the Laval case. That was 10 years ago now but it is still relevant. Here you will remember a Latvian firm won a contract to build an educational facility in Sweden and brought in a team of Latvian workers to do the job. By way of collective agreement, they undertook to pay those workers less than the Swedish minimum wage, which was an act of law in Sweden. The unions and the Swedish Government objected. They took it to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Justice found in favour of the employers. When the employers and the unions in Sweden objected further and said that they might take strike action, and was that not legitimate, was that not within the rule of law, was that not a right? then the ECJ came back with the answer: yes, it is a fundamental right to strike, but not as fundamental as the right of free movement. If that is the way this project is going, it is descending into an Orwellian nightmare and will come to grief quicker, rather than later. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the Troika was invented to cope with the stagnation of growth and jobs. It has imposed austerity packages which have included reducing wages. However, trade unions have long argued that wage depression becomes dangerous. One country’s domestic demand becomes another’s export potential. Squeezing wages also squeezes demand, so imports and exports both go down. In such a closely-related trading block as the EU, that becomes a serious problem for all, as it sets in motion a downward spiral. A stable home market keeps production going and boosts exports to the rest of the world. The greatest hope, surely, is to allow those EU countries that need it to withdraw from the euro and to restart trading on a better basis. It will be hard going, but they will see the end coming into sight. Of course, to remain competitive, they will have to set their currency at a favourable rate for the export trade, and that is to devalue. In that case, wages will remain low. But what do people want: a low paid job or no job at all? For those countries most badly hit, their economies are in the hands of the unelected Troika. Can we really accept that, in an EU which keeps on emphasising its democratic credentials, we have actually seen the duly-elected Prime Ministers of two Member States usurped by the placemen of the Troika? Unless the EU returns to proper democracy, we shall not see the end of this austerity. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commissioner for Employment says that free movement of workers is a key principle of the single market, which is why, in 2004, only Sweden, Ireland and the UK exerted restrictions on 10 new Member States. The then British Home Secretary Jack Straw now says that opening borders to eastern European immigration was a spectacular mistake, while Mr[nbsp ]Barroso recently admitted that the influx of eastern Europeans was putting pressure on communities and leading to abuses in some cases. Is realism now appearing? For Croatia, 13 Member States out of 27 will use restrictions, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, while Germany and Austria will restrict posted workers. Now, will Croatians join Bulgarians and Romanians in having first call on jobs in preference to third-country nationals, as in the Commissionʼs statement of April last year? But that is discrimination, and I raised this twice in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last year and did not receive an answer. I now require a commensurate answer as to why this discrimination continues. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 In answer to the lady, I was quoting an official Commission document circulated in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in April last year, which clearly and unambiguously stated that in any competition for jobs anywhere in the EU, anybody from Bulgaria or Romania applying shall be given first choice over anybody from outside the European Union. That is what I said, and that is what I meant, and that, Madam, is discrimination outlawed under the Lisbon Treaty, and I want to know why it continues. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, I was not blue-carding Ms Steinruck, I was asking to respond to the lady over there who named me for a second time in her response, and I require the right to reply. The lady concerned talked about my misinterpretation or the overuse of regulations, written and otherwise, by the Commission. This whole House works by the written regulations! Only recently we have had two examples in voting in this committee where a rapporteur was overturned in his request because he had not conformed to the exact written requisition that he was asking for. The whole point is that this place runs by written regulation, and I repeat, the regulation about workers from Bulgaria and Romania having pride of place over third country nationals was in a Commission document of April last year, and Mr Andor will confirm that.

 Madam President, homelessness and hopelessness lead to criminality in all too many cases, or at least to a social entrapment in which generation after generation is trapped in poverty. It threatens to become the scourge of the age. There are many causes, but one of the keys is surely employment, and one of the answers to that is surely education. I regret to say that my own government is guilty of neglect. In 1945 they introduced a scheme whereby those with academic ability could attend grammar schools, which had previously been the province of the wealthy. That offered a better way out, breaking the circle. It was the greatest social mobility scheme ever. It even benefited me, but later governments abolished it. We need an education system in Europe which caters for all abilities. We need academic schools, technical schools, commercial schools, sports academies, drama schools, universities and colleges of further education. We need industrialists to take on apprentices and send them to university at their expense, and we need those industrialists to invest in the poorer countries of Europe to help raise their standard. I do not believe in the mass migration of people across Europe promoted by this EU. We need settled communities, not footloose ones; we need people trained in a range of skills and for them, for the most part, to remain in their homelands to develop prosperity there, raising their standard of living and banishing homelessness through their own efforts. Finally, Madam President, allow me to point out that I come from country which was recently and disgracefully described by this Commissioner as a nasty country, and my final comment is: I do not wish to see poor countries in Europe.

Madam President, 9 000 people in Ireland – at Dell, Waterford Crystal and elsewhere – will be grateful for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, helping with guidance, training and education, when their firms close. Some blame cheap Chinese goods, produced through low wages, but two years ago in this House a Commission statement denied that this was true. The Commissioner said that it was China having its own central bank, setting its own interest rates and relating to world conditions so that exchange rates are helpful, resulting in goods at prices other people can afford. Instead, we have draconian measures in place to prevent individual companies establishing their own exchange rates and competing globally, promoting prosperity. At the same time, report after report comes out of this House, all imposing more regulation. The result? Higher costs, reduced sales, firms closing and moving abroad, leading to rising unemployment. And all you do is wheel out the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, trying to conceal the fact that company after company is closing under the weight of EU inflicted regulation, when you cannot even keep well-established companies going. And you call that world leadership? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the UK Health Food Manufacturers Association is non-profit. It represents 120 companies and suppliers; it has a very strong safety record and it knows that safety levels will be set well below what is regarded as safe in the UK in cases where there is no health risk. They know that only 22 additives will be allowed, meaning that potassium sorbate – a vital ingredient for vitamin D drops as recommended by our own Department of Health for children under the age of 36 months – will be banned.   GBP 100 million of sales are at risk. In the UK, over 700 health food stores will be at risk, with 4 000 jobs – all in the SME sector. Across the EU, over EUR 8 billion will be at risk: 5 000 companies and 75 000 jobs. And this report is supposed to be about more competitiveness, sustainability and an inclusive Europe. What is inclusive about shutting out the SMEs so that, once again, it is the big companies that pick up the trade and leave the unemployed from the SMEs to flounder and do what they can?

Madam President, I listened very carefully (or as carefully as I could) to what the rapporteur was saying on the various amendments to the amendments, but since our voting lists are not in numerical order of amendments it was impossible to follow, and we still do not know what those amendment alterations are.

 Mr President, I am against this report because I am a libertarian. I want to let the people decide what is best for them, and several UK organisations agree with me, especially on Amendment 40. The Commission document is a real dog’s breakfast. It lists among the regulatory instruments everything from sticking plasters to X-ray machines, taking in elbow implants, lung implants, breast implants, even presumably the metal implant in my own left ankle, which is now all metal and pieces of plastic and I am perfectly okay. The impact of this will, of course, be in over-the-counter sales, and here we have small and medium-sized enterprises at risk. You are going to drive up unemployment at a time when we already have over-unemployment; many young people out of work, when they could be working in shops selling this sort of thing. It will only produce more red tape, and the SMEs will then suffer. And who picks up the bill? Who picks up the pieces?  Why, the big pharma. They will make hay while the sun shines, when all the time everybody in the EU thinks it is all about them as individuals. It is not. It is all about the big companies. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, from Britain, from the House of Lords, our upper Chamber, I have received a note today of an inquiry they have launched into Europe’s young jobless. They note that the EU is going to spend EUR 8 billion over the next six years and they want to know if that will add any value to all these proposals. They note also that there is a brain drain in Europe and what are we going to do about it, with young people, without a job, leaving in such great numbers for work elsewhere? We all know that Spain has got something like 50% unemployed: 280 000 young people left Spain alone last year to seek their fortunes either in the rest of Europe or in South America. It is no coincidence that Spain, together with several other southern European countries, is struggling. Ireland, Portugal, Greece and others: what have they in common? The euro: a strait-jacket which is robbing them of their economy. No wonder they are in trouble; no wonder they have high youth unemployment. Let them sort out their own salvation with their own former currencies restored.

 I did not vote on any of the amendments since there was no voting option to reject the granting of authority for the Commission to extract payments for emissions.

  Mr President, I have recently been in contact with the President of the Caravan Club of Great Britain. He is most concerned about this possible new legislation. I personally am horrified. I don’t know how many other people here I speak for, but I was a caravanner for many years and belonged to the Caravan Club – not to attend their gatherings and rallys and so on, but to obtain advice and information, including tips on how to tow. I hardly use my caravan in the UK. I brought it across the Channel and had my holidays here. I’ve towed it all the way from Calais to the south of France. I’ve taken it over the Alps into Italy. I’ve gone around the Alps in Switzerland and other places, all without an accident of any description. Nor did I see one with any other caravan, and nor did I see a caravan on a caravan site which had obviously been damaged in an accident. Why? Because I took my caravan for servicing myself every year. I did not want to part company with my caravan down a German autobahn. Neither does anybody else! Do people not understand that if a caravan is not in good order and has an accident on its own, like snaking or suddenly departing from its pre-designed course, then it takes the car with it and everybody in the car will suffer injury if not death? Caravanners, in spite of what they might look like, are not mad. They will look after their caravans for the sake of their own necks. This proposed regulation is completely superfluous and I will oppose it with all my strength. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP strongly supports UK laws which seek to prevent, control or, where necessary, punish those who engage in domestic violence. The UK has developed an effective system of law to protect spouses and children from such acts. Such laws are constantly being improved. UKIP will always support sensible and workable developments in those laws. This measure allows the writ of foreign judges – who are in no way accountable to Parliament or the British people – to run the UK. A protection order made in any other Member State will be enforceable without further ado, potentially leading to imprisonment. As such this is an unacceptable infringement of the sovereign right of Parliament and the Courts to have exclusive jurisdiction over such matters according to UK law. Furthermore an order made by a foreign judge with no concept of the very real difficulties and practicabilities of the enforcement of such orders within the context of UK law will lead to grave injustices which will make those produced by the European Arrest Warrant seem tame in comparison. The UK Courts are the best forum for such matters, For those reasons we strongly oppose this measure, whilst abhorring all domestic violence. Derek Roland Clark,

Mr President, I speak from a UK perspective. We have a long and proud history of accepting people from elsewhere, especially those fleeing political and religious persecution.  In a time when there were no schools or hospitals, and electricity and public transport were non-existent, newcomers made their own way; but now they need these facilities, and we, the most densely-crowded country in the EU, are struggling to cope. That is no good for anyone, and we certainly cannot provide the social security they need. In these difficult times, we cannot provide properly for those who have been paying their taxes in the UK throughout their working lives; we cannot go on taking in people. So the suggestions in this report are impossible. Even my own government, which is in favour of the EU, is concerned that the number of proposals in this report are overly bureaucratic. We cannot regularise illegal immigrants. That would open the door to a flood of unmanageable proportions. Will the UK suddenly be expected to accept great numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians after 1 January next year? Especially after the Commission document presented to the Committee on Employment last April, which demands that Bulgarians or Romanians seeking work must be given prior claim over a third-country national. That excludes people from the British Commonwealth, who the rapporteur now thinks should go to the US instead.  It is also discrimination which is outlawed by the Lisbon Treaty. I do not think it is right to take in people for menial work; that is exploitation. Skilled workers from Eastern Europe may be welcome, but they are exactly what their own country needs to build their economy and prosperity. That is not fair. I do not want to see poor countries in Europe.  In truth, is not this report part of a programme to force people to move around the EU with financial assistance from the Commission, mixing up the peoples of Europe so that its countries disappear, to be replaced by a single state called Europe?

Mr President, note that unemployment in the EU is 10.5% of the working age population. Among the young it is averaging 28% across the EU, with nearly 50% in Greece and Spain. In the UK the overall unemployment rate is 7.7%, with youth unemployment at less than 20%. At the same time Britain is seen as unenthusiastic towards the EU. Indeed this morning, commenting on David Cameron, speakers said that we cannot take the parts we want and opt out of the rest. That is an echo of one of the first comments I heard in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs after election in 2004: ‘We do not want Member States to opt out of the Working Time Directive. That will give them an advantage’. But we did opt out – legally – of certain provisions of the WTD, leaving UK employers more free to employ workers. Is that why the UK figures are better than the EU average? Social aspects and growth improve when people have jobs. It is not therefore a question of policy coordination, but of keeping policy out of employment. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

The EU is not doing very well. Its economic growth is failing, which is what you are talking about today. The whole idea is falling apart.

Derek Roland Clark,

Mr President, we should be concerned that growth in the EU is fading and that companies are moving abroad. Result? A great increase in the claims under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help redundant workers. That must be partly the reason for the massive budget deficit we heard about this morning. Did I hear right then? EUR 60 billion? That is taxpayers’ money.  This report speaks, among other things, of disseminating good practices, improving soft regulation processes, company disclosure of social and environmental information, emphasising the importance of national and subnational policies, and more of the same. It is about time the EU stopped generating the red tape of rules and regulations. In itself that consumes resources, so cut the red tape, reduce the business rate tax burden, and big multinationals might become more responsible, inclined to pay their tax and not avoid it. They could then concentrate on marketing their goods, generating income and retaining the workforce. And we all benefit. John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark and William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP voted against this report as it is yet more EU legislation over criminal law. The EU has no democratic right to legislate in this area and law-making should be left to elected politicians, accountable to the public, not unelected foreign Commissioners in Brussels. Of course, victims of crime should have the strongest rights and legal protection, but that is already afforded in UK law and “minimum standards” at EU level may well create a race to the bottom which makes our criminal justice system weaker. Withdrawal from the EU, European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice would be a major step forward for victims of crime seeking swift and proportional justice.

 UKIP abstained on the final vote of this report. Although there are elements to CFP reform which will give a small bit of relief to the fishing industry – and any changes to the current disastrous CFP rules is a step forward for the industry which the EU itself has destroyed – the only way we can save our stocks and fishing industry is to scrap the CFP altogether and repatriate it back to national governments accountable by the ballot box. The EU has no democratic mandate to create law in the UK and we cannot legitimise the process.

 This is an own initiative report, which is non-legislative and not binding on the EU Commission. UKIP voted against this although we do agree with ideas such as the use of selective fishing gear, the move towards discards and we share concerns over the proposed system of ‘transferable fishing concessions’ – we cannot support calls for more powers for EU fishing agencies, the creation of EU rules as to how scientists should collect data or EU propaganda campaigns aimed at schoolchildren. The CFP has been an economic and environmental disaster and we supported amendments which will help our fishing industry, but until the CFP is scrapped and fishing regulation is given back to elected governments, our fish stocks and industry will continue to suffer. Fishing regulation should be created by politicians accountable to the people by the ballot box, not the unelected Commission of the EU. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, with fish stocks in serious decline in Europe’s rich fishing grounds, the CFP is a failure. Yet these reports are laced with the same old Eurospeak – regulation, restriction, prohibit. Before the CFP, most European fishermen, unhampered by bureaucratic interference, had been fishing responsibly, looking after their own waters and therefore handing on viable fisheries down the generations. But the EU destroyed this culture of care and so now we have rules about total permissible catch and the wretched discard policy, which has decimated stocks. If you do not like lessons from the past, then try the present. Norway and Iceland still record good catches and find many species spawning well, but then they ban discards and other destructive EU measures which, as noted in these reports, have reduced EU fishing fleets. The UK fishing fleet is barely half its former size and so much of the fish sold in the UK now comes from Iceland. What an indictment of the CFP.

– Madam President, I do not believe that spending more taxpayers’ money will solve the growing problem of youth unemployment. Nor are grand plans and schemes, like the EU Youth opportunities initiative, the answer, for these have nothing to offer. To tackle a problem resulting from its own policies, the EU is proposing another expensive Commission programme. Rather, we should stop taking money from small businesses in particular, and remove the red tape burden from SMEs, which are the employers of half the workforce. That will free their businesses up and allow them to employ young people, reducing unemployment. We should reduce taxes on big business in return for them taking on young people in apprenticeships and training. With this kind of stimulus, they will prosper as their trainees, becoming more productive in years to come, plough their skills back in. For businesses offer actual practice and training, forming the habit of working and taking home money which has been earned, creating the dignity of providing for oneself, which can only help society. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

Blue-card answer. 
– It was not me that said this first. It was Commissioner Barroso himself who, just under two years ago, said in this House that red tape was strangling small businesses. I have since asked the Commissioner twice what he is going to do about removing or reducing red tape. I get no answer. As for what I mean, I mean all the petty, small regulations which so hamper small businesses and drive some of them to the wall and some of them to distraction as the owner sits up late at night completing this form or that form or accounting for this penny or that penny. No, it is not the complete answer; nothing ever is. But it would be a jolly good start if small businesses in particular were freed of much of this red tape so they could get on with the job of doing what they are doing and then, because they have got more capital to spend, employ young people and help youth unemployment.

In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the EFF has EUR 4.5 billion to spend on fishing over the period 2007 to 2013 covering scrapping of fishing vessels, aquaculture, inland fishing, sustainability and administration of the fund. But fishing managed very well before the CFP was introduced, livings were made, fish was plentiful. Since its inception in 1973, the CFP has introduced rules and regulations to control fishing. Now the EFF – why? After all, fishermen have been plying their trade for centuries without all this, and a viable industry has been passed down the generations. Fishermen are not stupid. They have looked after their stocks, just as a farmer looks after his livestock and land. This proposal, of course, is a backdoor way of giving extra financial support to countries which have been bailed out, bailout funds under the EFSM will trigger this extra support from the EFF, and yet more taxpayers’ money goes down the drain. So this whole scheme, purporting to help fishing with more funds, is really an addition to bailouts, which are supposed to be loans by way of bond issues with time limits for repayment. Does that mean that the extra EFF money will not be included in bailout repayments? Does it mean that cash will be available without issuing bonds? If so, EFF funding will be a gift to offset a debt. What kind of finance is that? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, with the Greek and Italian debt crises under the burden of the euro, of course unemployment is rising. Spain has over 40% youth unemployment – yet there is a call for more Europe. Employment policy should be to cut regulations by half at least as the target for 2020, instead of which more legislation is being proposed. If you want growth and jobs, stop promoting the failed euro. Look at what it has done to Greece. Set them and others free, free to reorganise their own currency and to set their own interest rates. Remember the euro forerunner, the ERM? My country was in that project; interest rates rose and so did unemployment. Finally, interest rates went up to 15% – totally unsustainable – but at least the government came to its senses and withdrew from the ERM. That was on Black Wednesday in 1992, but it should be remembered as ‘Freedom Wednesday’, for interest rates fell, employment gradually recovered and we entered a period of economic growth. Now that is the model you want. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP supports democracy and human rights. However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers. We do however, feel the accusations of vote rigging in Russia are serious, and would like to see these allegations investigated by a third party. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, how many men does it take to change a light bulb? In one English council, tenants must send for council staff, who may not use ladders, only scaffolding. That is three people: one holds the rigging, one changes the bulb and one supervises. That is the crazy English, but I do have better examples. At a meeting six years ago, I was astonished to hear of the number of young people injured at work. The independent body – unconnected with the EU – which had called the meeting suggested a range of safe practices which they claimed had reduced these figures – without legislation. As I have said before, good ideas always spread, and a Latvian took these documents to use locally. But the EU legislates; we do it every day. Why – if good results can be achieved by unbiased advice from non-political sources? So I ask that elements of this draft report, such as simplifying existing legislation, implementing national strategies and adjusting to the context of Member States, carry through to the final, advisory version. Voluntary systems are always best: no infringement proceedings. Derek Roland Clark,

. – Mr President, the CFP was only introduced in 1973, when the UK joined the common market. Up to then, UK fishermen had looked after their fisheries so well, without all these regulations, that other profligate Member States wanted a slice of our action. The result? Illegal fishing. Any system of complex rules and regulations produces cheats – that is human nature. Now you want to duplicate our coastguard and to consider more rules to combat possible illegal recreational fishing. Does the EU never stop meddling? To preserve fish stocks, Member States must be responsible for their own fishing waters up to the 200-mile limit or the median line. Bilateral arrangements would be up to them and they would have to protect their own fish stocks in their own interests, under their laws and their enforcement. Norway does just that. Stocks have recovered, especially the spawning stocks of several species – but then Norway is not in the EU and does not have to obey its crazy rules. It bans discards, requiring that all fish caught be landed. Meanwhile, EU stocks are seriously depleted. I know thought is being given to discards, but after 38 years of waste, will our stocks recover? As to combating illegal fishing globally, the EU’s discard policy is the greatest illegal fishing scandal of all! That – and licensing European fleets to raid the waters of the third world, reducing those people to poverty – is what I call illegal. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, to quote from your own documents, ‘national and local events will take place in every EU Member State’ – awareness-raising campaigns, workshops, school indoctrination and so on. The documents also say that this is mainly the responsibility of the Member State. No EU money is forthcoming, so it is Member States’ money. How do those countries most in need manage that? Only last month, this House voted to raise the take from Member States by 5%. Of a hundred budget lines, some 20 were for a reduction. With like-minded MEPs, I supported those – which would have saved European taxpayers EUR 100 million – but was outvoted by most of you on all except two lines, so only EUR 1 million was saved. If people keep more of their earnings, they spend more, helping other businesses to keep going and helping employment. So Member States who really need help for this programme will not get it. Where will they find the money? You have already raided their bank balances for bailout funds. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

− UKIP is firmly against all forms of sexual offences against children and in favour of tough, comprehensive criminal law to criminalise all forms of sexual offences against young people. The UK already has a considerable body of criminal law dealing with these crimes and remains at the forefront of developing new laws and techniques to combat perpetrators' activities as they develop in the internet age. UKIP supports the thrust of this report but cannot, as a matter of principle, concede to the EU the right to determine UK criminal law. For that reason we have abstained. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, we have been here before. Remember the Lisbon Agenda – the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world leading to more and better jobs, a 10-year programme which started in 2000? Where is it? It failed, of course: simply because you keep on thinking you can solve a problem by central decree. Sorry, it does not work that way. Such programmes need a written plan, and then rules and regulations, and there we go: straight into the red tape jungle. If you could only understand that: cut the red tape and all the restrictive regulations, and let people get on with what they do best – making things and selling them. Once again, I must remind you that big business can cope with red tape and can afford compliance officers and well-paid lawyers to bail them out if they make a mistake. SMEs, which employ half the workforce, do not have those resources, so when they get into trouble, they fold. Another one or two jobs go, and fewer youngsters are taken on to learn a trade. Take this morning’s farce in the vote on tyres for motor vehicles and trailers – not really a farce: it is another headache for the motor trade. For how many small garages will this be the last straw before they go under? This whole agenda is another one-size-fits-all idea, or rather, one-size-that-fits-no one. The euro is one of those: now falling apart before your eyes, and all you can think of is to try more of the same. The first casualties of that disaster are, of course, the SMEs – and more jobs are lost. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to ask the Minister how he can justify this proposal to treble maternity pay by requiring firms to pay new mothers their full salary for 20 weeks. Does he not know we are in the middle of one of the worst recessions of modern times? This will present businesses with the prospect of a 2 billion burden. Even my government opposes this move. In addition, Minister, you plan to extend minimum parental leave from three months to four months for each parent. That is separate from the maternity leave, with one month of the four not transferable to the other parent. Is the Council prepared to compromise on main issues like the duration of maternity leave and the level of payment? Otherwise, you intend to give Member States two years to amend their laws – though how you can say ‘their’ laws, I do not know. This comes straight from the Commission factory, and we shall oppose this job-destroying proposal. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was invented to persuade Member States to adopt Lisbon without national referendums, but this expensive project has insufficient checks. In Antwerp, General Motors claimed EUR 9.5 million from the EGAF. Their redundant workers received EUR 150 000 each and then some found work with Volvo nearby. Of the five countries with negative growth, three have put in no claims, while stronger economies have, with Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria leading the way, and several more this week. Many firms are closing due to trade moving to the Far East. Glasfiber in Denmark closed because their manufacturer of wind turbines moved to China. This does not happen just because Chinese workers are on low pay; indeed, on Tuesday in this House, the Commissioner discounted that. More to the point, what he said was that China’s central bank sets its own interest rates, while the exchange rates make Chinese products more attractive on world markets. EU manufacturers will struggle on world markets if euro membership makes their products too expensive – ask Greece! Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Rio +20 Earth Summit 2012 sounds important – but is it really? The Socialist one-world agenda has been having a hard time of it of late. Global problems require global solutions: sounds good. But global governance through scare stories about man-made global warming has fallen flat. People in the UK, US and China are hugely disbelieving. Everybody knows that CO2
 is not the cause of the ice ages coming and going. So how can a little extra CO2
 be a problem now, whether or not it causes a little extra global warning? Is not a little warming a good thing? Would anyone here really prefer icebergs in the Channel and polar bears in Brussels? The same goes for the even more vague scare stories that have been peddled using meaningless rhetoric since Rio twenty years ago. No one knows what sustainable development really means – and who would want unsustainable development anyway? The environmentalists’ ‘ban everything accept windmills’ attitude is going to send us back to the Middle Ages unless we put a stop to it. You are calling in this document for tangible actions and accountable targets, but of course that is all just Soviet five-year plans all over again. It is about time we recognised these failed Communist policies for what they are and go back to the honest free-market approach which creates wealth for all by innovation and hard work, not by endless interfering and political tinkering.

 – Madam President, yet another expensive, bureaucratic monster arises by combining VIS, SIS and Eurodac, whether or not any Member State currently participates in these agencies. It is meant to develop Schengen, which itself is under pressure due to the Libyan situation. What is the use of a system to allow free movement which has to be partially suspended because of the free movement it encourages? I understand there will be a central agency to retain fingerprints and biometric records for five years, including material obtained under SIS – ‘information regarding certain categories of persons and property’. So, under the guise of facilitating the free movement of people, we have a resurrection of the Stasi. Of course, this is intended to lead to EU immigration control. In the case of the UK, many immigrants come from the Commonwealth, a unique voluntary association including every single one of our former colonies. Well, we have our own border controls for that purpose, and the EU does not have the right to interfere. Derek Roland Clark,

 Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues. In the UK in May 2008, the Misleading Marketing Regulations came into force. They outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service. So the Office of Fair Trading can now take action against UK companies, but there is a serious drawback. The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints. More to the point, while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing, why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland Europe? The answer to that lies at the heart of this useless EU, which has demolished national frontiers. The free movement of people, goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers, the terrorists and for threatening, traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary.

– I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments. UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent, have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy. Unfortunately, the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, just when responsible people and governments are watching every penny, the Commission proposes more expense – Youth on the Move card, European skills passport, European Vacancy Monitor – through Europe 2020, all for cultural diplomacy and to get young people to travel when they do that already, backpacking their way round the world on their own initiative. What do we need expensive promotions for? As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: ‘United in Diversity’. Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire? Do not push EU culture; make Italian, German, French, Dutch, British and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them, and the rest will follow. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, this review’s 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market, but the eurozone is collapsing, so how can it provide more opportunities? It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets. What growth? In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio. I got no answers then, but now it seems I have some. The review’s five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations. The first principle of the review – creating a right environment – should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids. It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred. After all, Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year: ‘red tape is strangling SMEs’. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr President, after 30 years, the destructive practice of discards is to be addressed. Fleets at Grimsby are a few dozen fishing boats, where once there were a hundred. Two years ago West of Scotland fishermen tabled a plan to conserve white fish but, while they wait, stock depletion continues. A regional approach is suggested – why not? The EU divides the land into regions. Much worse is the renewal of licences for European fleets to raid the waters of the Comoros islands – and raid it will be, for local fishermen cannot compete with the superior EU-powered trawlers. The same thing has been done to others in that area. Is the House surprised that Somali fishermen denied a living have resumed the age-old vice of piracy? Five years ago, did Members see the TV pictures of hundreds of Western Saharans trying to seek refuge in the Canaries? EU licences had just been renewed for their waters and they too had seen it all before. In a pitiful, desperate attempt many died on the 800-mile journey in fishing boats never intended for the open sea. However, the EU does not care that people from the least-developed countries have been impoverished by its actions and, for that, it deserves to be condemned. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report claims that European solidarity and economic development will be threatened by a reduction of the budget. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory – that is why I voted against a freeze – when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break. Derek Roland Clark,

– Mr President, this goes beyond Ireland. Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms. Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages? I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States. It is all very well to say that ‘equal’ must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU? As an example, think ‘climate’: keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries. Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others. Of course wages cannot be equal. The Commission’s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties. I am not surprised: this is the EU at work. A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal. Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, my point of order regards the first two votes we have today on the calendar for next year and the year after. I have two points to raise, if you please. First of all, these votes simply illustrate how powerless this Parliament really is. Everybody here thinks they are getting more and more power, and more and more influence. But, in point of fact, these amendments are simply to get round the fact that we are obliged to have 12 part-sessions … (The President cut off the speaker) Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this question mentions a territorial dimension with reference to other policies, including the CFP, which is a complete EU disaster. Fish stocks in the North Sea, part of the Atlantic, have been ruined by discards, which must be abolished. They should never have been contemplated in the first place. UK fishermen have carefully looked after fish stocks in their own territorial waters while others have ruined theirs by overfishing. No wonder the CFP was welcomed by other Member States, whose fishermen could not wait to get into the North Sea. One needs more territorial exclusion, not less. In my own region – the East Midlands – the fishermen of Boston have fished the Wash for generations, looking after the fish stocks and making sure that their trawl nets do not disturb the sea bed, for they know that this is where the immature shellfish develop and that this is where the creatures form the bottom of the food chain. This is their livelihood. Now they are forbidden to fish, on the pretext that their trawls damage the sea bottom. Meanwhile, a Dutch vessel is licensed to hoover up a million tonnes of gravel from the same sea bed, while E.ON is to dig a trench right through to the open sea to lay the line for a useless offshore wind farm. How much damage will all that do to the sea bed? How much longer will these fishermen be forced to stand by and watch their fishing grounds reduced to nothing while they are reduced to being benefit claimants? Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 22 November last year, the rapporteur said that pensions were exclusively a competence of the Member State. Now this has become something more like: although Member States have the lead, there are aspects where coordination at European level is important. In paragraph 9, the resolution stresses Member States’ competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies. There is double speak here, with EU control overturning principle. The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive – by 90% according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall. If that is exaggerated, it is certainly true that huge extra sums will be needed to prevent pensions collapsing, so premiums will rise massively. Pension firms and Member States do not need this report; they need help to keep premiums down. Otherwise, this misguided report has the potential to destroy that which it seeks to protect.

– Mr President, I am happy to read this speech on behalf of Mr Bloom, who has – in my view – been unfairly debarred from the Chamber this afternoon. We had a fiasco a year ago in Copenhagen, when 15 000 unqualified people, including MEPs and the whole entourage, descended on the place to double its carbon footprint for a fortnight and got hopelessly embroiled in climategate, which was very neatly timed to scotch the proceedings. Yes, we all remember the University of East Anglia getting shown for what it is: a centre of bogus science churned out by bought and paid-for scientists who rely on the EU’s Research DG and the UN’s ‘super quango’ for research funds and laboratories and on the UK taxpayers for their wages. They were shown up as forgers of data, forgers of climate computer models, hiders of inconvenient data and conspirators with Obama’s green minions. The taxpaying masses learned in no uncertain terms that the EU and the global green agenda is all about raising our carbon taxes and scaring us into compliance. Cancún would be not nearly as bad, of course. It is much warmer. It is a jolly winter, and the conspirators will be much more careful to hide their global governance agenda this year.

– Considering the illegitimacy, undemocratic structure, corruption and megalomaniac ulterior motivation of the European Union in general and the Commission, in particular, we of the UKIP cannot condone the Commission’s monopolisation of public funds for any purpose whatever and believe, consequently, that any monies it directs to the repair of last year’s flood damage in Ireland will not be properly used and will merely conceal the need for relief funding that is correctly disbursed and directed by democratically elected governments.

– UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries, as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines. However, in this case, the EU is making special arrangements for governments, outside of normal State aid rules, for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines. Amendment 25 and 36 are calling for a greater period of such flexibility before normal State aid laws would apply, which UKIP can go some way to support. UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because, although we do not support any EU State aid laws because it should be up to national governments to decide on subsidy levels, giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable, putting power back in to the hands of governments to make these decisions.

– I voted against the Gauzès report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom’s most important industry – financial services. It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive, from investment trusts to hedge funds, in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation. It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors. This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU. As usual, EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players. By punishing private equity funds, it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy. It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments. The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital. Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, poverty, especially the number of those at risk of poverty, has grown as the EU has grown, with each new Member State adding to the problem, so it is pretty obvious how to prevent further increases. One of your answers is to introduce a minimum income. I am in favour of a minimum wage, but only as set by each country for itself. A pan-EU minimum wage would distort the issue. In Scandinavia, for example, domestic heating must be more expensive for all income groups than in southern Europe. I oppose a minimum income because that means public funds to top up a low wage: more for the taxpayer to find in an economic crisis. How do you stop some employers paying less than they might because they know the benefit system will make it up? Answer: more regulations and red tape for businesses, falling most heavily on the SMEs who, between them, employ half the workforce. And, of course, minimum income harmonised across the EU will be followed by a harmonised tax system, reducing all to a grey amorphous mass, devoid of Europe’s greatest property: diversity.

 Mr President, what is the Commissioner thinking about? Has the Commission been asleep for the last two years? Here we are, at a time of economic stringency, despite what Mr Van Rompuy said this week. There are millions out of work, some newer Member States have still not got the promised financial package, and Germany has a billion-euro bill round its neck to underwrite the Greek economy. In Britain, my government is raising taxes, freezing public sector pay and pensions and cutting back on welfare while finding GBP 45 million every day for this place. And now you want to spend EUR 1.1 billion of hard pressed European taxpayers’ money on a programme to help partner countries along the EU borders. Is that what you mean by more Europe – or is it an attempt to draw these countries into the EU? It sounds like empire-building to me. After all, José Barroso himself called this an empire. We are told that the EU is to prevent further wars in Europe, but if you look at the record you will find that such wars were due to the empire-builders. Now you are doing it all over again.

What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, the only guideline is for the EU to stop interfering. The Working Time Directive is a disincentive to work. Why cannot you let people work overtime when they want to? Please do not tell me that this is to protect workers from exploitation, when the EU’s puppet court, the ECJ, has ruled in favour of companies exploiting groups of workers by paying them less than a minimum wage in no less than four countries. Are you aware that more than a fifth of newly qualified junior doctors in the UK are turned down because the WTD means they lack experience and that more are dropping out of training for the same reason? This House passed a report on independent truck drivers recently which will result in many of them packing it in. In voting today, MEPs have approved a paragraph in the Bové report – which will add a massive reporting burden to SMEs – hours after President Barroso had complained that SMEs were being strangled by red tape. The EU is the problem, not the answer, as the people of Europe are beginning to realise. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP voted against the Alvaro report today because we do not want to give the EU greater power over personal data. This measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy. Confidential and private financial data belongs to the individual and not to the EU or the European Parliament. We are resolutely opposed to the spread of terrorism, but personal confidentiality must be protected where there is no prior suggestion of wrong-doing. If the UK is to enter into an agreement with the US it must be a fully reciprocal arrangement and not the almost one-way-traffic one that the EU has signed up to here. This is a matter for national governments to decide, and not for the European Parliament. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I abstained on the vote on Amendment 80 because, while the case for national governments to scrutinise the control of EEAS must be guaranteed, this amendment also guaranteed the right of the European Parliament to do the same. It is not acceptable to a sovereign nation for a European organisation to scrutinise its foreign service. It is not the business of the EP to do so. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against Amendments 1 and 29 so as to restore the Commission’s intention to exclude independent drivers from this directive. We believe that requiring independent drivers to account for the time spent arranging their schedules and bidding for new business will be impossible to monitor, especially when this is done at home, as well as using part of their allocated maximum working hours per week. This will result in less driving, causing them to become less competitive and resulting in unemployment. UKIP also believes in the freedom of individuals to set up in business and to work for themselves, but this directive will prevent that from taking place. Since this is not a health and safety issue, the only winners will be big businesses. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

in writing. 
– UKIP voted against the Sommer report in the European Parliament because it is badly drafted, with inadequate definitions. The country of origin statement was badly worded, giving rise to confusion. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers and consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the public. UKIP believes MEPs are acting without sufficient information on this matter. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, it is essential that Amendment 30, with special regard to paragraph 7(a), be adopted. Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions. It is not a road safety issue. All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph. Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency. Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business. If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers. Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector. The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce. I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect. You do not hear that very often from this part of the House.

– UKIP regards the safety of nuclear power generation as being of great importance, but perceives the EU’s assistance to Bulgaria, ostensibly for this purpose, as being motivated by political considerations (preventing the reprocessing of fissile material, conveniently close to Bulgaria, in neighbouring Russia) and doctrinaire ones (the imposition of unrealistic wind-power policies) as well as by a desire to fund local conservation projects, which are not relevant to the remit of decommissioning. Consequently, UKIP members have voted against the extra funding asked for in this report. John Bufton  (EFD

– We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean. This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa. It would also allow North African al-Qaeda operatives in these countries to more easily enter Europe and carry out terrorist attacks.

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report.

– Madam President, why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level? Universities have shared information with each other for centuries, before the EU existed. The Renaissance, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, was a surge in intellectual development spreading from Florence right across Europe through the universities. The arts, music, literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today. So what of modernisation? Do you look for the technological developments of the future? If so, the scene today is just as promising. Universities elsewhere may be overtaking us, but they owe their beginnings to European universities. This tide of higher education often returns home. The universities of Britain take postgraduate students from across the world, pursuing their studies further and sharing their information, not least with commerce and industry. But we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the Bologna and the Erasmus processes. We do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other ‘-ism’, that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus. If you wish to serve the modern and future worlds, see that universities are funded properly, encourage those students who wish to study abroad, then simply leave them all alone to get on with it. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, in anticipation of your calling the next vote on the Lehne report on deontology, may I please ask why this vote is being taken? It was due for debate last night under catch-the-eye. That was cancelled, so here we are voting on something which has not been debated, although it does not say so. For your information, Madam President, when this came before the Employment Committee a short while ago, nobody on that committee knew what deontology meant until I tried to explain it to them – not even the Chair! I think it is highly improper, therefore, to take a vote on this unknown, undebated motion. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the report on simplification of the CAP because, although the implementation of the report would make the policy more comprehensible, transparent and workable, simplifying farm inspection, adding to flexibility to payment arrangements and making it more farmer friendly, to do so is to keep the CAP on track and potentially help to extend it for another generation! UKIP therefore voted against the resolution as a whole, especially as it is without legislative impact. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Whilst I recognise that the conflict in Gaza and the West Bank is a humanitarian tragedy, my votes do not support the existence of international influence of the European Institutions as I do not recognise the European Union.

– UKIP is totally opposed to people-trafficking as it is a modern day version of slavery. We call for the highest penalties in the land for those criminals perpetrating such a crime and for serious measures to wipe out such activity. However, we cannot support the EU using people-trafficking as a pretext to harmonise immigration and border policies over the heads of elected governments. It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability. If there were not open borders within the EU, and each country had its own immigration policy, serious organised crime and people-trafficking would be much easier to stamp out.

– UKIP is gravely concerned with the situation in Iran and calls for governments on both sides to come to a diplomatic, but above all, peaceful solution to the ongoing political and humanitarian breakdown in the country. The EU must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate the tense situation. Unaccountable EU bureaucrats, instead of elected politicians leading the negotiations, will end up with a bad outcome for Iran and the rest of the world. Negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments, not forced upon from above by the EU. There are many countries wanting to stay neutral, such as Ireland, and the EU representing those countries on this issue seriously undermines their democratically-backed policy.

– UKIP fully supports the relief efforts and is horrified at the loss of life and those affected by the disaster, but we cannot support legitimising the EU in spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money, along with its militaristic and diplomatic ambition to circumvent democratic and accountable nation states intervening in the crisis. Of course, we encourage government and individuals to give relief and money to help those affected and rebuild the country. However, this must be done transparently with the public and not by secretive, unelected bureaucrats with international ambitions of grandeur. Derek Roland Clark,

– Mr President, like charity, rights begin at home. I ask about the rights of Europeans Sikhs. Because they wear the kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger, beneath their clothing, they have been prevented from entering the European Parliament. The kirpan is an act of faith which they may not remove, so their exclusion is a matter of religious and racial intolerance. In successive years, I have written to each of the two previous Presidents and the Commission who all replied that the exclusion is on security grounds. In celebrating her diamond jubilee, Queen Elizabeth came to my region, the East Midlands, where in their place of worship in Leicester, she talked to Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan, standing as close to them as you are to your colleagues. I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago, I was at the Palace of Westminster. There, in our democratic parliament, very close to both the House of Lords and to the House of Commons, I met several Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan. With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know. His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears, fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours. As a result, you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place. So what of the Lisbon Treaty which speaks of a Union founded on respect for freedom, equality, the rights of minorities, values of non-discrimination? Will you live up to your treaty, or is it just empty words?

− I acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, and deplore the refusal of the UK Government to assist its farming community on this important issue. This report contained provisions related to this situation. However, this report also contained provisions totally unrelated to farming, which would have had a disastrous impact on the UK. In particular, this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol, agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, I could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains my vote on the subject. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Thursday 17April is the 30th anniversary of the murder of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher in London. She was killed in a hail of shots into a crowd from the Libyan Embassy. The murderer has so far not been brought to justice. Information has come to light that a suspect living in Jordan has confessed to the murder and his identity is known to the British security services and to the Metropolitan Police. So far, no action has been taken by the British authorities to question him and, if the evidence so demands, to request his extradition from Jordan to face trial. Contrary to popular belief, most of those in the Libyan Embassy at the time did not have diplomatic immunity and the suspect is not protected. PC Yvonne Fletcher deserves justice and the British authorities must now make every effort to bring her murderer to justice without further delay. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the Stockholm Programme includes the objective of constructing an EU system of criminal law. It is laughable that the EU should presume to create an area of so-called freedom, security and justice in England. The English already did that for themselves over the last 800 years and it served as a model for much of the civilised world. That system is now being subverted because of our subordination to an inferior continental system. This report euphemistically refers to the various so-called imbalances within the emerging EU system. These imbalances are caused by the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition which states that all EU Member Statesʼ police, judicial and penal systems are of equal value. This is absolute nonsense and is causing a growing number of cases of gross injustice. To protect ourselves, Britain must leave the European Union. And to bring that day forward the British can vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the EU intends to create a Public Prosecutor’s Office with vast legal powers across the Member States. The British Government has already announced that it will opt out of the public prosecutor scheme. However, the Government has already announced that it intends to permanently opt in to the 35 EU police and criminal justice measures. As I said here last month, those 35 measures are the most important and the most dangerous to our traditional freedoms and liberties. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the Government’s decision to opt out of the Public Prosecutor’s Office is both worthless and dishonest. The Prosecutorʼs Office will have at their disposal the use of all the existing legal instruments, such as the European Arrest Warrant, and the new ones, such as the European Investigation Order. Although the Prosecutorʼs Office will have no direct authority in the UK, it will have de facto power by means of the use of these legal instruments. The Tory-led coalition Government knows it cannot defend accepting the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the UK, so it seeks to achieve the same thing by the back door. There is still time for the Government to reverse its decision and opt out of the 35 measures. But to fully protect ourselves, we have to leave the European Union. To do that, vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

  We hear a lot about fundamental rights in this place. In England we had very good fundamental rights long before we joined the European Union. These were established over centuries under Habeas corpus
, the Bill of Rights, the presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt, to name just a few. These safeguards are now being destroyed by the creation of the EU’s own system of criminal justice. The European Arrest Warrant has been the cause of numerous cases of gross injustice, and these will continue to grow. Now we have the European Investigation Order, which will empower foreign police forces to require British police forces to carry out investigations on their behalf, which we will then have the privilege of paying for. The coalition government has the option to opt out of the existing 135 EU criminal justice measures. Instead it has announced its decision to opt out of 100 but opt in to 35. The 100 they are opting out of are of no consequence, being purely rhetorical, redundant or superseded by later legislation. The 35 measures they are opting in to are the worst and most dangerous, including the European Arrest Warrant. None of this is necessary, because there are already existing mutual assistance measures in place that allow police forces and judicial systems to cooperate with each other across national borders. This is not about cooperation. It is about harmonising our legal system in pursuit of the great ideological goal of a United States of Europe. If David Cameron is serious about repatriating power from the EU, he has the golden opportunity to do so now. There is still time to change the decision and opt out of all these measures, thereby protecting the real interests and freedoms of the British people. But I fear the Tories will do what they always do and sell their fellow countrymen down the river to the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Claude, can I ask you to retract something that you said in that speech? You referred to the Crete case and Mr[nbsp ]Hughes and you said that his attackers are on trial in Greece. No, those accused of attacking him are on trial in Greece and they are innocent until proved guilty. Some of them have alibis showing that they were not even present at the place where the attack took place. Nevertheless the lack of evidence against them has not stopped them being extradited. I know that you are a very fair man so would you like to retract the word ‘attacker’ and say ‘accused’ instead? Gerard Batten  (EFD

blue-card question
. –
 Sarah, you spoke about the excessive length of pre-trial detention and I would agree with you: that is to be avoided. But would you agree that one of the reasons for this is because, when people are extradited to Britain, the police must be case-ready. They have to have a case fully prepared to go to trial before they can extradite somebody. Whereas under some continental systems investigative judges may hold people while they investigate, which results in sometimes weeks, months or years of them being detained. Would you agree with me that every police force in the European Union should be case-ready before they request somebody’s judicial surrender? Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Madam President, this report calls for a directive which will allow judicial authorities to confiscate someone’s assets without a criminal conviction. What happened to the presumption of innocence until proved guilty? The bedrock of the English constitution is the Bill of Rights, 1689. It clearly says ‘that grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before convictions are illegal and void’. That means that no government or judicial authority can impose a fine or take away someone’s property for an alleged criminal activity, but must first secure a criminal conviction in a court of law. The Bill of Rights is a constitutional act and is still in force. Our freedoms and liberties are being eroded and destroyed, and the pretext is always the same: that we have to be protected from crime and terrorism. But the single biggest reason for the increased threat of crime in the UK and Europe is the EU’s open borders policy. Open borders mean that we cannot stop criminals – big and small, organised and disorganised – from coming to our country. Indeed, it will be illegal under the EU’s freedom of movement directives to discriminate against criminals. All UK MEPs should vote against this report. If a directive is adopted, then the British Government should unilaterally refuse to transpose it into UK law. It would be illegal and void. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Mr President, on the one hand, it is good for once to be able to agree with the report in that it opposes the merging of the European Police College and Europol. On the other hand, UK Independence Party MEPs cannot vote for it because it calls for yet more powers to be given to Europol. This report wants to increase Europolʼs powers to participate in the investigative and judicial proceedings of Member States.  Europol is of course the European Union’s emerging cross-border police force – the United States of Europe’s own FBI – but there is no need for it, or to enlarge its powers. Bilateral agreements between nation states are a far cheaper and more effective way of achieving the desired results, and by these means nations can retain democratic control and accountability over their own police forces.  Existing mechanisms and Interpol already exist to provide cooperation between the police forces of nation states. Few people in Britain realise that Europol officers have immunity for anything that they do or say in the course of their duties. Such immunity is a concept unknown under English law, where it is a centuries-old principle that no one is above the law. We need genuine cooperation between nation states, police and judicial authorities. We do not need a European police force, leading eventually to a European police state. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Madam President, on 10[nbsp ]February an article by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown appeared in The Independent
 newspaper. The headline described certain people as ‘hideously white’, while the text included a description of them as ‘pompous, backward and white’. These derogatory descriptions associated with race would appear to be an offence under the Race Relations Act. On that basis I have written to the Metropolitan Police.  The Independent 
is, I believe, on sale on the continent. If an EU citizen outside the United Kingdom complained about the article then Mrs Alibhai-Brown could find herself the subject of a European arrest warrant issued under the category of racism and xenophobia. She could find herself locked up for a considerable amount of time on the order of an investigating magistrate while the case is looked into. I would, of course, oppose her judicial surrender under a European arrest warrant as being contrary to the principles of English law. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, this morning President Barroso restated the European Union’s commitment to open borders as a fundamental principle. A sensible immigration policy in Britain would allow entry only to those people we might actually want: people with the skills to fill jobs that genuinely cannot be filled by our own unemployed; people who have a legitimate right to marry British citizens; people who are hardworking and law abiding. Instead, what has the EU given us? We also get criminals, drug addicts, alcoholics, beggars, vagrants and benefit-seekers. Decent British people see their living standards being driven down, while benefits and social housing are given to people who have never paid a penny in tax in the UK. That is what the EU has delivered for us, and next May the voters of Britain will deliver their verdicts on you, fellow Members, when they vote for the UK Independence Party in massive numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the subject of public procurement brings to mind the problems with the Brussels hemicycle. The hemicycle was, of course, closed in September 2012 because cracks were discovered in three of the beams holding up the roof. In December 2012 we were told that Parliament was having difficulty in finding a builder to do the repair work. This was, apparently, because they were concerned about the ten-year guarantee required. If the Chamber is reopened in April, as promised, it will have been closed for 18 months. Surely Parliament’s public procurement procedures should have been able to find a builder willing to do the work, given that money is no problem? Some might suspect that the long delay was deliberate, in order to prevent the Brussels Chamber being used as the sole meeting place of this Parliament, thereby ending the monthly and expensively monstrous trek to Strasbourg. If Parliament cannot organise its own public procedure policies, how can it possibly hope to organise everybody else’s? Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, some of you in Europe may need an area of freedom, security and justice. We already had one in England under our Constitution, our common law, protected by such things as the presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, the trial by jury and under the Bill of Rights. These are now being superseded and overridden by the EU creating its own system of civil and criminal law.  Any British citizen can now be carted off to any other EU Member State purely on the strength of a piece of paper: the infamous European Arrest Warrant. All of these rest on the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition, which says that any EU legal system is equal to any other EU legal system. This is obvious nonsense. The British Government had the opportunity to opt out of 135 of these measures in mid-2014; instead, it intends to opt into the 35 worst and most dangerous. Mr Cameron could have genuinely repatriated some powers; instead, he is going to hand to the EU on a plate powers that endanger all our traditional, centuries-old liberties and freedoms. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Madam President, this report marks another step on the way to the European Union having its own armed forces. The Treaty on European Union of 1992 laid down the foundations for a common security and defence policy leading to a common defence. Common defence means only one thing: common armed forces, a European army. That goal is being steadily pursued by means of common procurement procedures, common communications systems and common command and control structures.  The British armed forces are being deliberately run down so that their resulting weaknesses can be used as an excuse for eventually merging them into a common EU army. The British army now has fewer soldiers than the German army had after the Versailles Treaty. Meanwhile, they are stretched to breaking point and expected to perform miracles. If Britain’s service men and women understand the writing on the wall, then they will vote en masse
 for the United Kingdom Independence Party. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

blue-card answer
. – 
I do not think that this actually matters, because ever since I first sat in this Chamber in 2004 – and I spent the first four or five years on the Subcommittee on Security and Defence – it has been obvious that this is the goal that is being pursued. How many other constitutions have been overridden and changed in order to accommodate EU integration? Our own constitution in England is overridden and set aside by what is happening in the European Union, so I do not think they are going to worry about a few other smaller countries’ constitutions when pursuing their ultimate goal.

 Mr President, the regional development funds are some of the most expensive items in the EU budget. These schemes are often just a waste of money, but a waste of money used to promote the EU’s identity as a political state. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has also been a gift to organised crime. In Bulgaria, the mafia profited massively from ERDF funding being channelled into projects in which they have financial stakes. And now the criminals of candidate countries are keen to get in on the action too. The ERDF is a key part of EU propaganda. Legal requirements say that EU flags and placards must be fixed in places where the money has been spent, but there is no such thing as EU money. There is only taxpayers’ money. Member States would be better off spending their own money in their own way in a democratically accountable manner. Britain cannot afford this and it is yet another reason why Britain has to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, in his book In Praise of Folly
, Erasmus castigates various establishment groups of his day, and it still makes amusing reading 500 years later. In his criticism of theologians he says: ‘They will proclaim me a heretic. With this thunderbolt they terrify the people they don’t like. Their opinion of themselves is so great that they behave as if they were already in heaven; they look down pityingly on other men as so many worms. A wall of imposing definitions, conclusions, corollaries, and explicit and implicit propositions protects them. They are full of big words and newly-invented terms.’ It is unintended irony, surely, to associate the name of Erasmus with the European Union, the greatest folly of our age. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, by its nature, citizenship can only be of a political state. All British citizens were made citizens of the European Union in 1993 without their consent. Few realise that this also includes our supposedly sovereign Head of State, Her Majesty The Queen. Under the still-existing English Constitution, the Head of State cannot be subject to a higher political authority. The English monarch is the physical embodiment of the sovereignty of the nation, and that is the fundamental problem at the heart of British membership of the European Union. The British people still imagine that they are a free and sovereign people, and yet they are not. The issue can only be resolved by them, by a democratic decision accepting their new status as a region of the European Union, or by leaving and re-establishing our national democratic independence.

Mr President, if people have been illegally transported across European borders by the CIA, then that is wrong. Every criminal suspect is entitled to open justice and a fair trial. However, this oral question is not about that. It is about asking the Commission to introduce more measures to bring national security services under its control. The public can read more about this plan in the Commission’s own document entitled ‘European Security Strategy: A secure Europe in a better world’, published as part of the Stockholm programme.  These proposals are just another step along the road to creating a United States of Europe. Just as the EU now has its own foreign policy and is taking control of Member States’ armed forces, so it needs control of their security services to complete the picture. The EU does not yet have the power to do that and we must ensure that it never does. Gerard Batten,

Madam President, in the previous debate, Commissioner Malmström, if I heard her correctly, said that she wanted to open up more legal avenues for migration into Europe. Mrs Malmström, why do you not go to countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain and ask ordinary people how they feel about that? I imagine that the vast majority would tell you that they are ‘immigrationed out’ and that they actually want fewer – not more – waves of people coming to their country. Maybe you should try stepping outside of the Brussels ideological bubble and, dare I use the term, show some solidarity with the ordinary working people of Europe. You talk here about border controls, but you have no intention whatsoever of actually trying to control immigration. Britain is swamped by continual waves of immigration from outside and inside the European Union and the only way we can control that is to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, between 1958 and 1962 tens of thousands of women gave birth to babies with severe birth defects, including missing limbs. The cause of this was the drug Thalidomide, prescribed to pregnant women. In the UK there are about 467 surviving victims. As they age, their health problems are made worse by their disabilities. Some compensation was paid by the Distillers Company Ltd, the UK distributors, but the German inventor of the drug, Grünenthal, has never properly accepted its responsibilities or paid compensation to the British victims. The compensation the victims did receive is now inadequate to meet the rising costs of their care.  The survivors are an extraordinary group of brave, resilient and independent people. All they want is for Grünenthal to face up to its responsibilities and to arrive at a fair settlement. Please register your support for the Thalidomide victims’ campaign by going to their website http://www.showyourhand.org" . This gross injustice has gone on for 50 years too long. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, it has long been the reality that the USA could intercept any electronic communication anywhere in the world but the advent of the Internet and digital communications has created a whole new treasure trove of information which can be plundered by the security services. The reason that so many terrorist attacks in the UK and elsewhere have been thwarted is precisely because the security services have accessed the terrorist communications. Now that is on the plus side, but on the minus side the state now has the technical means to know almost everything about individual citizens. Now the challenge for democratic nation states is to ensure that access to personal information is only used according to strict legally established and internationally observed rules which protect the individual from the state. What we do not need is the EU using this issue to further assert its pretentions to be a political state. Equally it does not help that the British Government is now nothing more than a lapdog of the USA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I think that it was the IRA who said to the security services ‘you have to win every time, we only have to win once’. The security services have a tremendously difficult job in thwarting these attacks, and in the UK we know that there have been many – some we know about and some we do not – which have been stopped because of the security services’ ability to look at people’s communications. I think there are two issues here. There is the issue of what they can do by looking at people’s communications, and then there is this totally indiscriminate collecting of information on everybody, which I think is extremely dangerous. Can you imagine if Hitler, Stalin or Mao had had access to this information? I do not think that I am disagreeing with you; we probably agree more than we disagree on this. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, there is no rule of law in Russia. The Russian Government is a gangster regime which is successfully exporting the rule of lawlessness to the West. Meanwhile Western Governments follow a policy of appeasement. In 2006 agents of the Russian State murdered my constituent Alexander Litvinenko in an act of state-sponsored terrorism. David Cameron has broken his earlier promises to help uncover what happened; instead, he has made a deal with President Putin. The British Government is to withhold vital evidence from the coroner’s court proving the involvement of the Russian State. Russia blatantly murders people on the streets of London and the British Government agrees to look the other way.  Law enforcement in Russia is just a tool of organised crime. Any cooperation with Russia in security and legal matters should be out of the question until the rule of law is properly established there. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, last year we saw the Schengen system buckle under the strain of mass migration, and some Member States sought to introduce unilateral controls. The revision of the rules is an attempt to keep the lid on a boiling pot, but it is too little and too late. It only allows some controls in very exceptional circumstances for a limited period of time. It is too little, too late.  An open-borders policy could only work between countries with very similar and stable economic and cultural natures. The EU’s open-borders policy is a disaster for ordinary people, and has created enormous social problems. This has all been done in pursuit of a political ideology not shared by the people of Europe. That ideology is that the continent of Europe is a single country, a United States of Europe, which obviously it is not. The EU is out of touch with reality and in a contest between reality and ideology, reality always wins in the end.

Mr Goebbels, you asked about border controls. Yes, Britain is not in the Schengen system, but we still suffer from the effects of it because it is very much easier for people to get to Calais and make that final hop over to Britain. You are quite right: even though we are supposed to have border controls, immigration policy is a disaster in my country. This is not just because of the European Union, it is because of the complete inability and lack of will on the part of British governments to actually put in proper immigration controls and carry them out. So I agree with you that this is a disaster in my country that is not entirely of the making of the EU. In answer to Ms Morvai’s question regarding the free movement of people: no, we do not believe in the free movement of peoples in my party. We believe in controlled immigration and controlled border policy. We do not want to stop immigrants; we do not want to stop people coming. But we want this to be controlled by our government in the interests of the British people, and not in the interests of a political ideology which they do not share. If you are going to control people, it is a lot easier to do that than capital, which is often numbers on a computer, so I understand the problems there. We want to see policies in a whole range of areas that are in the interests of the British people, and then ultimately in the interests of everybody else. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the economies of Europe are in deep crisis, and unemployment is reaching record levels. But there is one boom industry offering unprecedented employment opportunities. That of course is organised crime. This report recognises the seriousness of the situation and offers the solution we have come to expect on every occasion, namely a common European approach and more harmonised laws. But it is precisely the common European approach that has helped create the problem in the first place. Every annual Europol organised crime threat assessment report since 2009 has said that the root cause for the growth of organised crime across Europe is the EU’s own open-borders policy. This report suggests the creation of an ‘intelligence training centre’. However, the intelligent thing to do would not be to set up another institution expanding the power of the EU, but to reintroduce border controls to prevent the free movement of criminals in the first place.

Mr President, I would like to apologise in advance for digressing from the subject of this debate and using my time to make reference to a shocking incident that has happened in my constituency, London, today. There has been a particularly cowardly and disgusting terrorist murder of a man in Woolwich. Initial reports indicate that the victim appears to be a member of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. I am sure that all of you, like me, will offer your deepest sympathy to the victim’s family, friends and colleagues. It is not possible to express the depth of outrage that all decent people will feel at this latest expression of barbaric and mindless terrorism. This crime will be condemned by all decent people.

Mr President, as this question makes clear, the report calls for the Commission to publish its proposals on a voluntary permanent Union relocation scheme, as promised since December 2011. It is the intention of this scheme that Member States can request assistance in the relocation of refugees and asylum seekers across EU borders. The UK, of course, has a long history of accepting refugees and asylum seekers in very significant numbers over centuries. If the proposed scheme is voluntary then what is the point? Member States could continue to determine their own responses to particular circumstances in relation to their own ability to respond, which is exactly what they should do. Asylum and immigration policy should remain under national control. It is easy to understand why the Commission does not want to come up with a scheme that will be unworkable in any case.

 Madam President, the next meeting of the Bilderberg Group is to be held in England. The location is thought to be the Grove Hotel, Watford, and the dates to be 6 to 9 June 2013. These annual meetings are summits of the most wealthy, powerful and influential people in the worlds of politics, finance and business. The biggest mystery surrounding them is why the mainstream newspapers and broadcasters have chosen not to report on them since 1954. In the internet age, however, their existence can no longer be kept secret. I have written to all the mainstream media outlets in the UK asking them if they intend to report on this meeting and if not, why not. I have also submitted a freedom-of-information request to the Hertfordshire Police Commissioner asking on what basis the policing for the event is being provided and who is paying the bill.

 Madam President, this is just a public relations exercise to paint a veneer of democracy over the undemocratic European Union. The best definition of democracy that I know of was given by Abraham Lincoln, who said that it was ‘government of the people, by the people and for the people’. There are no common people in Europe; there is no political identity with which they can identify, so you can never have a true democratic system in the European Union as a whole. The only democracy that makes any sense is the democracy of nation states, where people identify with a common political identity. All democratic governments in different countries take different forms. They all have different structures. But in order for a country to be called a democracy, it must have one single characteristic: the ability not only to elect the government but also to sack the government and replace it with a different government. Of course, that is the one thing you cannot do in the European Union. The people do not select the Commission, who are the effective government of the European Union, and they cannot sack them. Therefore no country that is a member of the European Union can claim to be a functioning democracy. We are seeing our democracies destroyed. All the governments of the western world, and in particular those of the European Union, are disconnecting from their own people and imposing policies on them which they do not want – like mass uncontrolled immigration and idiotic climate change legislation, which is destroying their economies. The only Citizens’ Initiative which makes any sense is the initiative to leave the European Union. People in Britain have the opportunity to do that by voting for the UK Independence Party, and they are doing it in increasing numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, why does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place? I expect she hopes to benefit from EU handouts and subsidies like so many before her. As a relatively poor country, I also expect that she hopes to offload some of her poorest citizens – her surplus population – by means of mass immigration under the EU’s open borders policy. Turkey has over 72 million people, and if she joins the EU we can expect a large number of them to migrate to countries like Britain. Perhaps they will come to work, or to go on the benefits or housing system again like so many before them and use our public services. The British public must beware that the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democratic parties are all in favour of Turkish entry and of yet more waves of mass immigration.

Mr President, over the last decade the international community has spent an enormous amount of money in assistance to Kosovo. At a rough estimate this is about EUR 4.7 billion. This includes about EUR 2.3 billion from the European Union and Member States. One of the key targets for this aid has been to combat organised crime and establish the rule of law. Now, how is that progressing? The EU office of criminal intelligence has said that ‘the situation regarding organised crime in Kosovo has not changed considerably since 1999’. A Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly report in December 2010 linked senior Kosovan politicians to criminal gangs involved in human organ trafficking. We already have plenty of criminals from Kosovo in London, despite the fact that it is not yet a member of the EU. EU entry would enable yet more to come. We already have enough, thank you very much.

Mr President, mutual societies and building societies were an excellent idea that originated in 18th century Birmingham, and the idea caught on and enabled millions of people to buy their own homes when otherwise they would have been unable to do so. But they were not intended to be cross-border international entrepreneurial businesses. A much better idea is for individual nation states to adopt the idea and adapt it to fit in with their own national requirements. This statute, if adopted, will mean more unwanted EU legislation and probably lead to unforeseen, unwanted consequences and unintended consequences. If there is any case for international cross-border operation, then there is no reason why this could not be accomplished by sovereign nation states with intergovernmental agreements.

Mr President, if I am in good shape it is not because I play football. I would happily admit that I know absolutely nothing about sport, but I do know a little bit about match-fixing.  First of all, let me say that this report calls for a specialised law enforcement unit to combat match-fixing. Well, I am pleased to tell you we have already got one in the United Kingdom, it is called the police force.  Having said that, in terms of match-fixing, the EU has been involved in a few fixed matches itself. Back in 1975, in the referendum in the UK on membership of the EU, that was a fixed match, when the Central Intelligence Agency of the USA put enormous amounts of money into the ‘Yes’ campaign and there was a concerted effort by the BBC and other organs of the media to actually fix the result. There was a fixed match in 1992 in Denmark when the referendum delivered the wrong result and they were told to go back and have a re-match until they came up with the right result. There was a fixed match in France and Holland on the Constitution when they came up with the wrong result, but rather than have the re-match, actually they changed the terms of the game and declared it a win anyway. And, of course, Ireland had a match fixed when it delivered the wrong result on the Lisbon Treaty, and then had to go back and have a re-match until it got the right result. So if there is going to be some kind of investigative body to look at fixed matches, I suggest we start with the European Union.

 Yes, I happily admit I know nothing about sport. I pretend to have no knowledge of it whatsoever.  In terms of international crime, there is already an international crime organisation called Interpol, which is there to share information, and there are national police forces that are there to pursue crime in their individual nation states. So I cannot see why you need yet another new body to do something that is already catered for by existing police forces and Interpol. I do not know why you imagine that some other body, created by the European Union, is going to be any more efficient than all the other bodies created by the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, it is poetic justice that my party, the UK Independence Party, wins seats in this place and wins them in increasing numbers. Indeed, we came second out of the UK political parties in 2009. We did so precisely because we are dedicated to taking Britain out of the European Union.  Regarding the composition of Parliament in 2014, I would like to make one prediction: the UK political party most likely to come first and return the highest number of MEPs will be the UK Independence Party. This will reflect the growing mood of the British population and will be another important milestone on the road to achieving Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, what does social security coordination mean? Does it mean that the benefits systems of all EU states are brought up to the British standard at their taxpayers’ expense? No, it means that the British benefits system is made available to any EU citizen who wants to use it. My constituency – London – particularly feels the impact of foreign claimants on the housing, health and benefits systems. David Cameron has had to respond to public outrage by saying that he wants to limit EU citizens’ access to benefits, but he cannot do so, and he knows it. It is not often that I can agree with an EU Commissioner, but Viviane Reding has said that this is against EU law and that he cannot discriminate on the basis of nationality. England is now the soup kitchen of the world, and the soup is running out. This is just one of the reasons why we have to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Many of my constituents have contacted me in desperation because their disability payments are being cut or stopped altogether. One lady rang to tell me of her young adult daughter who has a learning disability and whose disability benefit payment was being stopped because she has been assessed as fit for work. She took her daughter to the Job Centre to look for something she might be able to do. She found that all the low-skilled, low-paid jobs were taken, often by migrants without the disadvantage of a disability. In the same queue were EU citizens signing on for the Jobseeker’s Allowance. She asked me to explain why we, as a country, cannot afford her daughter’s benefit but we can afford to pay benefits to migrants from the EU. I told her that this was because our Government’s spending decisions and priorities are not decided in the interests of their own citizens but rather in order to comply with EU law and their ambitions to build a borderless United States of Europe. I further explained that the only solution to the problem is for Britain to leave the European Union.

Mr Van Orden, if in your report five years ago you highlighted all these problems – which were very serious problems then and which you now say are still very serious problems and in fact even worse probably than when you wrote your report – why did you then feel it necessary to recommend Bulgarian entry to the EU when it clearly did not fulfil the criteria that one would expect, the most basic criteria about rule of law and democracy in an entrant country?

Mr President, in January 2014 the final restrictions will be lifted on immigration into Britain from Romania and Bulgaria. A further 29 million people will be given the automatic right of entry, and it is estimated that this will result in at least 50 000 extra immigrants per year over the next five years. Britain is already overwhelmed and swamped with immigration because, as a member of the European Union, we have surrendered our right to control it. The British have nothing against Bulgarians or anyone else: we do not blame them for wanting to better their lives. But why do so many Bulgarians want to leave their country? Bulgaria is a desperately poor country under the control of criminals. Let me quote from the New York Times: ‘Politics is played to the death in Bulgaria, where the lives of politicians can be as cheap as spent bullets and murky business groups wage a murderous struggle for their cut of everything from real estate deals to millions in European aid’. Atanas Atanasov, a former counter-intelligence chief, has said, ‘Other countries have the mafia; in Bulgaria the mafia have the country’. How can democracy prosper under these conditions? There is a lack of a free media and press, a corrupt judiciary and legal system, widespread electoral fraud and criminal control of business. It is no surprise that many Bulgarians will choose to move somewhere else. One good thing that the EU did do was to suspend payments to Bulgaria. It is not right to send millions in aid for their criminals to plunder and make them richer. I feel desperately sorry for decent Bulgarians, but I feel even sorrier for my own country, which is being destroyed by membership of the European Union. The British political establishment is dedicated – or seems dedicated – to turning Britain into a third-world country. Britain cannot solve Bulgaria’s problems by importing Bulgarians.

Yes Mrs Dodds, I would agree with you. I think that we should designate groups like that as terrorism because the last thing that we want to see is what happened in Northern Ireland.

Of course, I would like to see action taken against Islamic fundamentalism wherever it raises its head because it goes hand in hand with terrorism. In London we now have Sharia patrols intimidating people on the street on what they can or cannot do or can or cannot wear, and gays have been intimidated in the Bethnal Green area.

Mr President, this report proposes a regulation to reduce noise from motor vehicles and, like all legislation from this place, it will entail more bureaucracy and cost. For example, the report says that the quality of road surfaces may be the solution to the problem. Perhaps, but how much would it cost to alter them? Given the current state of Member States’ finances, one wonders where they would find the money to carry out this momentous task.  This is a regulation. It will have automatic, binding, legal effect in every Member State. Democratically elected national governments do not have the right to decide whether they want to apply it or not: they have no choice. Perhaps control of noise pollution is one of those powers that David Cameron wants to renegotiate the return of to the British Parliament, among those many thousands of others long ago surrendered to the European Union.

 Mr President, Mr Imran Firasat is a Pakistani who converted from Islam to Christianity. Spain granted him asylum in 2004 because as an apostate his life was at risk. The Spanish authorities are now threatening to deport him to Pakistan under hate speech laws mandated by the European Commission.  Mr Firasat produced a film entitled ‘The Innocent Prophet’, as part of his critique of Islam. An altered version of the film was released last December without Mr Firasat’s consent. This appears to be the extent of his transgression. If Mr Firasat is deported he may face the death penalty for alleged blasphemy.  Individuals and organisations across Europe and the world are calling on the Spanish authorities not to take any action until Mr Firasat’s lawyers have lodged his appeal with the Spanish High Court.

Mr President, this is yet another unwarranted and unnecessary transfer of sovereignty from the nation state to the European Union. There is a highly respected patent court in the UK which is currently worth something like GBP 750 million per annum and this is now in danger. Patent specialists in the UK strongly contend that there is no demand in the UK for this change. There are serious concerns about judicial appointments to the new court and therefore about the quality of the decisions that will be made. Instead of a meritocratic appointment system, it seems that subscribing Member States will be entitled to a judge. Many of the smaller countries have tiny patent jurisdictions, few patent judges and few legal practitioners in this field from whom to choose judges. As with so much legislation from this place, this is being done in favour of very large companies at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. SMEs and individuals will be seriously disadvantaged in protecting their innovations, by reason of cost and inconvenience, bearing in mind that they will have to go to France and Germany to protect their work rather than to local courts.  We are told that there will be cost savings, but that is not the opinion of experts. One estimate is that litigation costs will increase by a factor of three.

Mr President, England had fundamental rights under the common law for centuries before the concept was dreamed of by the European Union, and we do not need the European Convention on Human Rights to bestow them on us. Those ancient rights and liberties are now being destroyed by the creation of an EU system of criminal law, for example under the infamous European Arrest Warrant. What have your fundamental rights given us in return? Suspects against whom no evidence has been presented to a British court can be extradited and imprisoned for months or years without trial. Meanwhile, we have been prevented from extraditing non-British suspect terrorists and criminals to their own countries outside the European Union because of legal judgments made under the Convention.

 Mr President, of course SIS is an international police database system but also associated with this is an EU police organisation called SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at National Entry). Now this is a little known organisation and it has been described by some of its operatives as top secret. It has executive powers and although Britain is not yet a member of the Schengen Group, the UK is expected to joint SIRENE in 2013. It already has officers working within Member States’ police forces and our German SIRENE officer is attached to the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency and his name is Jan-Per Ruehmann. Under Schengen an alert placed on an SIS database should be treated as a European Arrest Warrant. Therefore within the Schengen area, at least, extradition may now simply be on the basis of the hit on a database. European Arrest Warrants will rise sharply after we join SIS in 2013.

 – Mr President, this report seeks to generate a regulation to restrict members of the public from purchasing, and to require notification concerning sales of, a large number of substances which are commonly used for legitimate purposes. Unfortunately, the UK has extensive experience of the use of home-made explosive devices – for example, terrorists have used fertiliser as a basis for bombs for many years. The UK does not need the EU to tell it how to manage the availability of such substances. This is a regulation which seeks to extend the power and dominion of the EU using the prevention of terrorism as a pretext. I and my UKIP colleagues will therefore vote against. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 – Mr President, I would like to comment on an article in today’s Daily Express
 by Leo McKinstry. He writes that the Tory Party should offer some kind of electoral deal to the UK Independence Party. Now UKIP should never accept any such deal for the following reasons: The Tories can never be trusted. They have betrayed Britain for over 40 years and they would betray anyone. If the Tories wanted to offer the British people a referendum on continued membership of the European Union, they could easily do so. They do not need to make any deal with UKIP. If UKIP entered any such pact, it would destroy our credibility with the electorate. UKIP would end up in the same position as the Liberal Democrats, facing electoral annihilation, and the cause of Britain’s exit from the European Union would be lost forever.

We should not forget that since July 20 1999, former Chinese communist party President, Jiang Zemin, ordered the start of the systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which is still going on. The Amnesty International Annual Report 2012 on China, published on 24th May 2012, states that the Chinese authorities continued to pursue a systematic, nationwide, often violent campaign against Falun Gong; The US State department reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 published on 24th May 2012, where it states that overseas and domestic media and advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting, particularly from Falun Gong practitioners. All of us who care about democratic government should speak out about the last 13 years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China and democratic governments and societies everywhere should send a strong message to the Chinese Government to immediately stop persecuting Falun Gong practitioners in China.

Mr President, since we are discussing justice I would like to raise a disturbing issue that has come to my attention today. Mr Roger Hayes has been summarily sentenced to 21 days in Liverpool prison following a cursory appearance before a magistrate on Monday. Mr Hayes was arrested at 8.30 a.m., taken to court, sentenced and locked up by 6 p.m. that evening. No members of the public or witnesses were reportedly allowed at his hearing. Mr Hayes’ family have reportedly been refused any direct access to him. Mr Hayes is the founder of the British Constitution Group and is a prominent tax protestor. His case arises from his withholding of Council tax on a legally-based objection that the revenue is being illegally used. Mr Hayes’ imprisonment may well be illegal under English common law. Mr Hayes must be freed without delay and the issues behind it widely publicised. I hope this helps. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I have had literally hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails from around the world on this subject, at least 99.9% of them asked me to vote against it. I can assure these people, and especially my constituents in London, that I and my UKIP colleagues will vote against ACTA. But one element of ACTA which particularly concerns me is the criminalisation of offences under Article 23. Of course, genuine copyright and intellectual property right infringements must be prevented and owners’ rights protected, but the European Union is creating its own comprehensive police state with provisions such as the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order. Criminalisation opens up all kinds of sinister possibilities for suppressing free speech, dissent and alternative points of view. We only have to look at the case of Julian Assange to see where that can lead. All things considered, I urge my colleagues here to vote against ACTA. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, David Cameron has suggested that there might be a referendum on the European Union, but he does not know when and he does not know what the question should be. He only knows what the question will not be: should Britain leave the European Union? This is because he does not know what the EU will look like in the future. But we all know, do we not? Those of us here on both sides of the EU argument know exactly that it is intended to be a single European political state, a United States of Europe. The current eurozone crisis is being used to bring about financial and economic government and full political integration. The only person who apparently does not understand this is David Cameron. The UK Independence Party can explain it to him, exactly as we are explaining it to his voters. The only referendum that the British people want is a straight question on whether we should stay in or get out and we want it sooner rather than later. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania are threatening the EU-Canada trade agreement unless Canada lifts its visa requirement for visitors from those three countries. Canadians do not need visas to visit EU countries, whereas Canada has imposed visa restrictions on these three EU Member States. This is because of a previous influx of people from those countries who outstayed their welcome. Canada takes the quite reasonable view that not all EU countries are the same, and that some pose a particular risk when it comes to unwanted visitors and guests. The Canadians want to pick and choose who they admit and who they do not. However, this realistic view of the world falls foul of the EU ideological view that the EU is, in fact, one country, and to discriminate against one of its regions is not permissible. The Canadian Government already has a very generous system of allowing visa-free entry for 24 EU Member States, but perhaps it has looked at my constituency, London, and seen what a completely unrestricted open-door immigration policy actually delivers. They will not get the visitors and migrants they want – the decent, hard-working and law-abiding – they will also get the down-and-outs, the deadbeats and the criminals. In Marble Arch, the very centre of London, we now have migrants living on the street, with all the unpleasant social and sanitary consequences that involves, which I will leave to your imagination. This is what indiscriminate, visa-free travel can deliver. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement put in jeopardy by Canada’s reluctance to open its doors to allcomers is reputedly worth a potential USD 12 billion per annum, and would boost two-way trade by 20%. What does the world need now? Does it desperately need increased trade? Does it desperately need increased economic activity, jobs and increased prosperity? I think we would all agree that it does. Does it desperately need even more uncontrolled and unlimited migration? Most rational people would think that it does not. Let the Canadians choose who they want to let into their country, and on what terms. Let Canada and Europe get on with increasing the trade between them that can help us all out of the dire economic situation that we find ourselves in. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this report confirms what I have been warning my constituents in London about, and the British people generally, for some years, which is that the EU intends to create its own system of criminal law. This project is already very well advanced and very comprehensive and I have written about it in a report of my own, Freedom, Security &amp; Justice? or The Creation of a European Union Police State
. We do not need an EU system of criminal law in England. We have something called the common law which has taken a thousand years to evolve. We have safeguards under the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and habeas corpus, which are being swept away under this new system. They are being set aside. A British citizen can now be sent off to any corner of the European Union on the strength of a piece of paper with vague accusations. They can be imprisoned for months or years. The English and Scottish courts have abdicated their duty to protect their own citizens from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. Your system of EU criminal law would do for our liberties what the European single currency has done for your economies. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, we are going at such a speed that by the time I hear ‘for, against, abstain’, it is too late to put your hand up. I realise that everybody wants to go to their lunch, but we are either here to vote or we are not. If we are here to vote, we should do it at a speed where it is possible to put your hand up and down in the right order. Grazie, Signor Presidente! Gerard Batten,

Mr President, we see increasing moves by governments to limit our personal freedom and privacy, citing the need to protect us from the threat of terrorism and organised crime. However, we have to be extremely cautious in allowing our freedoms to be removed, because once they are gone it is very hard to restore them. We also have to ask if we have any particular reason to trust our governments. Legislation intruding into the citizen’s right to privacy should be proportionate, limited and controlled. Once it is enacted we need to be sure that its scope cannot be widened at the whim of government. This kind of legislation should never have been proposed by the Commission in the first place. It probably comes under the jurisdiction of international law. It should be devised under international agreements by sovereign nation states. The legislation is also unacceptable because it is one-way traffic between Europe and the USA. We have to give them our citizens’ personal information, but they do not have to supply theirs. The motion for a resolution wants the final decision to be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union to rule on its legality and compatibility with the EU Treaties. The UK Independence Party’s MEPs will vote against this legislation. We will not vote in favour of the motion as we do not accept the legitimacy of the European Court. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

Madam President, last year I wrote to David Cameron urging him to oppose the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The coalition government replied that they were obligated to accede to it and that in any case it would not change the existing situation regarding the UK. EU accession to the ECHR is required under Article 6(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Cameron could have given the decision to the British people by honouring his promise, indeed his cast-iron guarantee, of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. He reneged on that promise after the Labour Government had ratified the Treaty. But treaties are ratified by acts of parliament, and any act can be repealed. If he had wanted to, he could have repealed the ratification act and then submitted Lisbon to a referendum of the people. Instead he betrayed his promise and his guarantee turned out to be worthless. Now the government tells us not to worry anyway, because it makes no difference. But this is not true either. Britain could not opt out of or reform the Convention even if it wanted to, because we are bound by the Treaty of Lisbon. As usual the Tories betrayed Britain. Now they are in denial about the consequences of that betrayal. They had a solution and they did not use it. Now the only solution is the one advocated by the UK Independence Party, which is for Britain to leave the European Union. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

– 
Madam President, I have never advocated that Britain should leave the United Nations, which is a properly-constituted international body. It has always been my view, and it has been the policy of my party, that Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights and that we should repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. So I think I and my party have been entirely consistent in that. Gerard Batten  (EFD
),  
blue-card question. –
 We come from completely opposite views on this and I do not think we are ever going to agree, but I have come across a curious anomaly which I would like your view on. The European Convention on Human Rights has been used by people like Abu Hamza and terrorist suspects to prevent their extradition to countries like America on the basis that their human rights might be abused. But I have sat in courts dealing with European Arrest Warrant cases, and one in particular where the European Convention was invoked because it was almost certain that, in being extradited to Greece, suspects would be held in the Korydallos Prison, where it was 100% guaranteed that their human rights were going to be violated. But the government prosecutor put the point that since Greece was a signatory of the Convention on Human Rights it could not be deemed to be in breach of it. The appeal court agreed and the suspects were extradited. Is it not odd that foreign countries are covered by the European Convention on Human Rights but it does not seem to apply in European countries and does not offer the protection that we would give to people being extradited to the USA? Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, the harmonisation of EU social security systems does not, of course, mean the harmonisation of the benefit systems themselves – that would be unachievable – but rather the harmonisation of access to those systems by all EU citizens. What this means is that many social security claimants will gravitate to those states with the most generous systems. In Britain, nearly five million people are on the council house waiting list, with little prospect of getting a home, but in some London boroughs, almost 50% of social housing is given to people not born in the UK. Many of these people will never have paid a penny in tax and will be living on state benefits. Of course there is no point in homeless Londoners emigrating to other EU Member States to seek homes and income on their social security systems because the benefits will not be as reciprocal. No one should gain public housing or benefits in Britain until they have paid tax for a considerable period of time. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, jobs which could easily be saved are being lost in London because of EU legislation. The Tate and Lyle sugar refinery in the borough of Newham has been forced to cut back on production and lay off 30 staff. This is because, under EU quota rules, they cannot buy the raw sugar they need within the EU. However, the Commission has the power to change the rules and allow Tate and Lyle to buy what they need on the world market. I wrote to Commissioner Cioloş on 14 March, asking him to urgently meet with Tate and Lyle so they could put their case for resolving the problem. So far, I have not had a reply. We cannot afford to lose these jobs in one of the poorest parts of London. I urge Commissioner Cioloş to meet with Tate and Lyle as soon as possible in order to reach a solution. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I object to there being a roll-call vote because we have had this before. There is a clear procedure for requesting a roll-call vote. If people want one, then they should follow that. If we allow a roll-call vote on this because somebody requests it, then we could all request roll-call votes on all the bits that interest us, could we not? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, I know that Mr Helmer is something of an expert on this subject, and wonder whether he can confirm or deny something that I have read in the press, which is that if Britain closed down all of its industry, took every British aeroplane out of the sky and every British car off the road, this would not actually make any discernible difference to the world output of CO2
 emission gases. In fact, if we completely closed everything down, it would have no effect at all. Can he state whether that is true or not? Gerard Batten, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, this regulation is the thin end of yet another wedge. The danger is that it will lead to an EU law of property ownership. An EU certificate of succession is a short step away from a European probate registry and the introduction of an EU property tax. Now, I doubt that many people in England realise that we are debating the EU’s intention to take control of inheritance law. The one good thing I can say about this is that the British Government has exercised its opt-out. It has not done that out of any principle – it does not have any any principles where the EU is concerned and there is only so much that you can get past the British public at any one time. What amazes me is not that they have opted out but that there was ever any serious intention of opting in. I was going to address myself to the MEPs here but as there are so few of them it is quite a redundant statement this evening. Anyway, some MEPs might like to consider the wisdom of handing yet more control to the EU in this area and vote with MEPs from the UK Independence Party against it. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I just want to draw your attention to the fact that the first amendment on this report does not seem to have appeared on the Séance en Direct
 website this morning. It would normally appear there where it can easily be seen by all the assistants preparing the voting list. I am reliably informed that this is the first time this appears to have happened in the experience of our assistants in five years of preparing voting lists. Not all Members may be aware of its existence, and I wish to draw your attention to it. If you vote for this, then the whole of the rest of the motion falls. It is in support of the Hungarians being free to determine their own constitution without pressure from the EU. I would like to say that, but also I would be very grateful if you could conduct an investigation and let us know why it did not appear properly this morning. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, it is the first one. It is the EPP amendment, the first thing that we are voting on. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, I just wanted to add to what Mr Helmer said. Mr Helmer is well aware that flying the Union flag upside down is a signal of distress, so it is entirely appropriate that it should be flown upside down in this place. I would recommend that we fly it that way permanently. (Laughter) Gerard Batten  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, I have had hundreds of e-mails from my constituents on the subject of ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. ACTA intends to take alleged infringements of copyright, patents and trademarking from the jurisdiction of civil law to criminal law. Intellectual property rights have to be protected but ACTA, like so much legislation that comes from this place, favours the interest of big business over small business and individuals. If this comes under criminal law, the great danger is that alleged transgressors could be extradited on European arrest warrants to the four corners of the European Union to face months or years in prison. I and my colleagues in the UK Independence Party are once again the voice of the people in this place. UK Independence Party MEPs oppose ACTA and we will vote against it when the time comes. We urge all MEPs to do the same. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, in this next vote there are quite a few votes and, since it is far more tiring to put one’s hand up and down than press a button, I wonder if we could take them all as a block? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, the BBC is currently broadcasting a series entitled ‘Putin, Russia and the West’. In the second programme, Tony Blair’s former aide Jonathan Powell recounts the famous ‘spy rock’ scandal story. The Kremlin had accused MI6 of funding Russian human rights groups and other NGOs and using a fake rock located in a Moscow square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents. Mr Powell confirmed this story (whether it is true or not), and the BBC elevated it to the status of a scoop by issuing a press release. The FSB reacted promptly, publicly accusing two leading NGOs – Memorial and Golos – of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by the West. Both organisations are now under systematic harassment by the authorities. Powell’s claim is either untrue or illegal under the Official Secrets Act. The BBC is guilty of gross journalistic irresponsibility, and this shows once again that Putin’s is a gangster regime. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Blue-card question. 
– 
Mr President, I agree with Mr Nuttall but I do not think he goes far enough. Surely this is a disgrace and surely it raises a quandary for sports fans because, for example, in the World Cup, if the national flag and the EU flag are being displayed, then who are sports fans supporting – their country or the EU? Would Mr Nuttall not agree with me that they cannot support the EU because it is not a country? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, this directive calls for common rights for third-party migrants working in the EU. If adopted it would remove what little rights remain or are still left to Member States to determine their own immigration policy. It wants third-party migrants to enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals, including working conditions, social security and access to public services. But of course not all Member States have the same level of social security and public services, and of course a citizen of a state, by definition, enjoys the benefits of that citizenship, or should enjoy the benefits of that citizenship that non-citizens do not. If citizens do not have exclusive rights, then the concept of citizenship itself is meaningless. What this will mean is that third-party migrants will flood to those states that have the highest levels of public housing, social security and public services. No prizes for guessing that Britain will be top of their list as a destination. Equally unsurprisingly, I can tell you that UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this directive. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

 I know that may be technically true, but we seem to get saddled with these directives in time anyway. I am sure that we will not be able to wriggle out of it for very long, in the same way as we get all kinds of people turning up in our country and taking benefits in the social security and housing system, although they have got no rights to them. We know that for a fact. So while I hope that you are right and there will be a way of avoiding this, I think that in practice we will not. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, this directive includes the right to information for persons facing a European arrest warrant. In the case of an EAW, it will have to be a short letter. Subjects of EAWs effectively have no meaningful rights. Provided that the form has been correctly completed, the court has no power to refuse extradition. The court cannot base its decision on the prima facie evidence – or the lack of it – against the accused person. What is worse is that some people are being extradited, not after being charged, but to face investigation. One of my constituents in London, Dr Miguel-Ángel Meizoso, is facing extradition to Spain, not for something that he is alleged to have done, but for something he is accused of that he might possibly do in the future. If you do not believe me, I can give you the case papers. An English court would reject his extradition if it had any power to do so. Giving Dr Meizoso a nice letter will not protect him and will be small consolation. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to address Mr Barroso. You always tell the same story which is more of the same: more Europe, not less Europe. Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity was to keep on doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. You propose yet more swathes of legislation and yet more power to the EU. You have previously said that the EU must assume economic and financial fiscal governance of the Member States. Where has all this centralisation of power actually got you? The EU underperforms economically with the rest of the world, mainly because of the burden of job-destroying and prosperity-restricting legislation. The crises in Greece and Italy have been, in part, caused by their membership of the European single currency. Instead of organising an orderly exit, they have had to sacrifice democratic government and have it replaced by rule by economists and technocrats. You propose yet more of the same thing and expect different results. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to predict the result. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, the European Union is becoming increasingly unpopular with citizens across the continent. It is rightly seen as out of touch, undemocratic and dictatorial. The euro, its grand unifying political project, is collapsing round its ears. Greece and Italy are the first to pay the price by having undemocratic government imposed on them. So what does the Commission do to halt this decline in popularity? It comes up with vain and crass projects in an effort to make itself appear more relevant to Member States. First, it attempted to place the EU flag – which is not meant to exist anyway – on the sports kits of national teams. Then it calls for the EU flag to be flown at sporting events, and now it comes up with the crackpot idea of EU heritage labels. In the report, it says that these EU heritage sites would be monuments, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and even places of remembrance. What an insult! Are you really suggesting that war memorials which honour the brave and fallen in two World Wars should have an EU plaque placed on them? There is only one memorial in England I can think of where it would be appropriate to stick an EU plaque, and that is the gravestone of Ted Heath, the man who betrayed Britain into the European Union. I do not think anyone would object to that, least of all him. The report also says that the plaque’s aim is to strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU. It will not: it will just enrage the natives. It is just desperate propaganda from an organisation to which more and more people do not wish to belong. I urge all MEPs who are proud of the heritage of their own nations to vote for my group’s rejection amendment tomorrow. Let us stick the European Heritage Label on the dustbin of history. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this own-initiative report on the Professional Qualifications Directive is another piece of ideologically-driven harmonisation. It calls for minimum training requirements, automatic recognition and the removing of formal obstacles to recognition of professional qualifications. It goes on to say that ‘only if necessary should language tests be part of the recognition process and cannot be an additional border to mobility’. Most normal people would want professional qualifications, especially medical qualifications, to be subject to maximum, not minimum, standards – and not speaking the language properly should very much be a bar to practising and mobility. There is a case that clearly demonstrates the dangers. In 2008, a German-qualified doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani, was convicted in England of gross negligence and manslaughter after he over prescribed drugs to a patient. This directive means we cannot discriminate against EU professionals, while we must discriminate against properly-qualified fluent English speakers from the Commonwealth. This is another good reason, if we needed one, why Britain should leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in recent months, England has seen a series of despicable crimes: memorial plaques recording the names of the heroic dead of two world wars are being systematically stolen for their scrap metal value. Decent English people wonder how these revered monuments which have stood safely in cities, towns and villages for generations have become the targets for thieves. Today’s Daily Express
 reports that the police believe that these crimes are predominantly carried out by Romanian gangs. The EU’s open door policy is directly to blame; we do not just get the decent, honest, hard-working migrants that we might choose. We are forced to take the lowest forms of criminal life merely because they are EU citizens. Membership of the EU is destroying my country. What more revolting proof of that could there be than the melting down for scrap of the monuments to those who gave their lives so we could be free. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, demographics, of course, is a fascinating subject, and behind great historical developments and changes there is often an untold demographic story. Britain is now undergoing a massive population explosion which, until very recently, went unreported. When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997, we had a population of just over 58 million. That population has now grown to over 62.4 million and, on current trends, the population will grow to over 70 million by 2030 and thereafter spiral ever upwards. Demographers calculate that all this unsustainable population growth is down to migration and births to migrants. There is nothing wrong with some appropriate, moderate and sustainable immigration, but the UK is adding over one million people to its net population every four to five years. England is more densely populated than India, China and Japan. Britain does not have a cohesion policy, but if it did, it would leave the European Union and regain control of its borders and its immigration policy. Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, and thank you, Mr Bisky, you mention in your speech that anti-Europe sentiment and feeling was gaining ground. Can I ask you to accept that there is a clear distinction between anti-European Union feeling and anti-Europe? The people who are anti the European Union of the political construction, like me, are very pro-Europe. Would you please accept that there is a clear distinction there and we should stop talking about anti-European sentiment and start talking about anti-European Union sentiment? Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the so-called ‘six pack’ imposes economic rule on the Member States via the European Union. The English Parliament established in the reign of King Edward I that its key reason for existing was control of the public finances. In 1642 the English fought a Civil War and then cut off a King’s head precisely in order to establish its sole right to levy taxes. Now, not by means of an Act of Parliament, but by means of a regulation from the European Union, the British Government is expected to meekly accept financial control by the European Union. If it does, there can no longer be any pretence that Britain is a sovereign nation or a democracy. The British Government should reject and repudiate these regulations and defend the rights of Parliament. To do otherwise is abject surrender. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 The architects of the European Single Currency are to blame for the crisis that now faces the eurozone. The euro was never an economic project. It was a political project designed to help bring about a United States of Europe. Once of the vital attributes of a state is its currency and that is why the European Union forced through the introduction of the euro against all the sensible advice against it. You do not have to be an economist to know that to constrain a number of completely different economies within a single interest rate and exchange rate will, over time, bring nothing but problems and eventual disaster. That is what we are seeing now, and of course Mr Barroso is calling for full economic and financial governance of the eurozone countries by the European Union. The crisis was entirely predictable and so was Mr Barroso’s proposed solution. The euro is going to come apart. It is just a question of time. The longer it takes the worse the crash is going to be. The people to blame are those who forced the economies of the eurozone into an economic straightjacket in order to serve a political dogma. Gerard Batten,

– Madam President, there is indeed a massive problem with illegal immigration into Europe. The effects of this problem are especially felt in England and, in particular, in my constituency of London. England attracts immigration – illegal and legal – because of the possibilities for work and our generous benefits and housing systems. The UK Independence Party would not be opposed to genuine cooperation between European nation states to counter the problems of illegal immigration – but this proposal is not about genuine cooperation. It seeks to change the legal basis on which Frontex operates and gives it more so-called competences. It will, for example, give Frontex the ability to cooperate with third-party countries on behalf of the EU. This proposal is yet another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. The proposal is another step in introducing the European Union’s common immigration and asylum policy as enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. As I will never tire of saying, the Lisbon Treaty was undemocratically imposed on the peoples of Europe without their consent. The Lisbon Treaty was illegal under existing English constitutional law, and everything that stems from it is therefore illegal in England. There is another problem here, which is the European Convention on Human Rights. British courts are obligated to protect the human rights of foreign nationals in the UK. Once in the UK, they only have to claim that their human rights are likely to be at risk in their own country and the courts will not send them home. As a result of this, we have given refuge to all kinds of criminals. If I heard him correctly, Mr Busuttil said that all operations would be suspended while a human rights issue was being considered. This is like baling out a boat with a bucket that has an enormous hole in the bottom. The UK Independence Party will vote against this proposal. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Frontex report because it is nation states and not EU agencies which should control and patrol national borders. Frontex is an affront to British freedom. This latest move is simply a power grab by the EU to give Frontex more money, personnel, equipment and powers. This vote gives the wrong powers to the wrong people. This proposal is another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Galileo programme as an expensive, useless and void EU project which alleges to replace the GPS system and, for example, enhance border security, but, in fact, is an ambitious project which merely seeks to promote the EU brand globally. Taxpayers’ money must be spent on more reasonable projects than sending into space EU-labelled satellites in order to compete with the USA. The purpose of Galileo is to further the EU’s plans for one military force to which I am totally opposed. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against this report as it reflects yet another example of an EU attempt to grab sovereign prerogatives of the nations in the region of the South Pacific. The EU is usurping the right to decide on matters which should remain in the hands of poor communities perfectly capable of managing their fishing and maritime preservation. Poorer nations from the South Pacific should keep the right to use their fishery resources freely to retain their independence and avoid the risk of massive emigration. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I am minded to quote the great American philosopher Murray Rothbard here, that the state is an institution of theft writ large. Tax is just about a system where politicians and bureaucrats steal money from their citizens, to squander in the most disgraceful manner. This place is no exception. Fascinatingly – and I really do not know how they manage to keep a straight face when they are talking about tax evasion – the whole Commission and the Commission bureaucracy avoid their taxes. They do not pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. They have all sorts of special deals – composite tax rates, high tax thresholds, non-contributory pension schemes. They are the biggest tax avoiders in Europe and here they sit pontificating. Well, I would point out to the Commission that the message is getting home to the people of the European Union. You are going to find that Eurosceptics are coming back in June in ever greater numbers. And I can tell you worse: as the people get your number, it will not be long before they storm this Chamber and they hang you, and they will be right. Godfrey Bloom,

Mr President, not for the first time I rise to give the House the benefit of my 35 years’ experience in financial services – rather more, I suspect, than the rest of you put together. Let me put you right on how this all started. It started with something called the Community Reinvestment Act in the USA, and the reason the whole thing has gone wrong is political interference. We have been talking today, have we not, about due diligence in banking? Well, the Community Reinvestment Act actually stopped banks carrying out due diligence checks. It became illegal to inquire of a borrower whether he could or could not repay the loan, and that is when you saw the invention of subprime mortgages, which had never existed before. It was political interference in the market which caused the subprime crisis. Add to that the bubble in the property market created by criminal, fraudulent central bankers printing money and artificially restraining interest rates, as central banks are still doing now. The US Federal Reserve is still doing it, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England: they are all at it, counterfeiting money. So we are lending money now at far too cheap a rate. We just print more money, and we are going to have another bubble and we are going to do the whole thing all over again! Allow me to close with one point which you clearly do not understand: if it is impossible to foreclose on a mortgage, nobody will give you a mortgage. That is how the market works. Leave it to the market, caveat emptor, and let people get on with it without interference from politicians who, frankly, do not know what they are talking about. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, I wonder if you will permit me to gallop through the working day of the average Englishman. He wakes up and turns on his taxed television to get the news; he leaves his heavily taxed house; gets in his heavily taxed car; he fills it with heavily taxed diesel. He then gets to work to earn an income which, after income tax, employer and employee national insurance, is reduced by a third. He drives home and stops on the high street for a few articles for the house. His purchases are taxed at 20%. He calls in for a pint, over two-thirds of the cost of which goes in tax. He dreams of a family holiday abroad, but he cannot afford the airport tax. He longs for the day that he can retire, but the politicians will not let him go.  We must steal his savings, must we not, through the financial transaction tax? The poor sap does not even know we have nicked it. Of course, with the Commission’s top income-tax-free salaries and non-contributory pension schemes, it is difficult for you to imagine his distress, is it not? You are not in this game, are you? You do not pay any of this. You do not pay any of this. On a more technical note, I draw the House's attention to my own lunatic committee’s Amendment 39 to Article 4a on the withdrawal of legal title to untaxed transactions anywhere in the world. This is sugar in the petrol tank, if you will. We are very much looking forward to the vote. We are watching to see which imbeciles commend it. I suspect it will be usual parliamentarian flat-earthers. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Madam President, as a matter of fact, I am not without some sympathy with the Council on this because you are trying to do the impossible. I think Parliament is trying to make you do the impossible.  The long and short of it is – as well known in Austrian economics – that, in order to regulate financial services, you would need perfect knowledge of the market. That is impossible and cannot be done. It is sometimes know as the fatal conceit. What we need to go back to is liberty of contract so that the individual, the investor, can contract under law in a property-owning democracy with whomsoever banker or investment manager he wants, without the interference of the state and the implicit guarantee of the taxpayer that goes with it. Central bankers and retail bankers hide behind regulation. They are not dominated or guided by regulation. It is what keeps these people out of prison when they cheat the general public. You are part of the conspiracy. For goodness sake, move away from prescriptive regulation and let the law of the land take its course. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –  
Mr President, my sincere apologies for not being on parade. It is quite unlike me. I do apologise for it and thank you for your courtesy. Interesting, is it not, that one of the great political questions in the United Kingdom when it comes to discussion of the euro is: cock-up or conspiracy. Is it a cock-up or is it a conspiracy? We are still arguing about that in the pubs of England. We are not quite sure. It must be completely obvious to anybody with even the remotest bit of economic understanding that this common currency was doomed to failure from the outset if it was not accompanied by fiscal policy. It must have fiscal policy to have one currency and one interest rate. It comes with the package. It must be part of the same phenomenon. The conspiracies theorists say, ah: they knew that this would happen, that this would collapse and that this would bring grief to many countries unfortunate enough and stupid enough to be part of this common currency, and what will happen is, when it collapses – when it catches fire, when it all goes wrong – they can then (‘they’ being the conspirators) push through an undemocratic system of government on people, whether they like it or not. I think this is the first part of it. This is what we are looking at with this document. It is the first bit of an undemocratic procedure so we can cut ordinary voters – members of the electorate – out of the system.

It depends on your perspective really, does it not? I would argue that there is no remit for a common fiscal policy. It has not been put to the people, either in a referendum or in any political way that I can see – certainly not in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, as you know, we have been promised but denied in reality a referendum for many years. I can only speak for the United Kingdom, but I would argue that there is no democratic remit for this and therefore you cannot push a common fiscal policy through. If you ask the people on the streets of Rome or Madrid, or Lisbon or Athens, I think you will get your answer. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Madam President, I find it interesting when I listen to these debates. The House always seems to imagine that there is some huge tree with money on it and you just pick the money off. Well, we have heard all about poverty, we have heard all about unemployment – all of it is true. Perhaps you will bear with me while I explain why. We have a crazy system of both corporate and social welfare. It is a failed post-war experiment. We have a system in the United Kingdom where we pay perfectly fit, healthy young men and women not to work. We import people from Eastern Europe to do that work. So we are pouring money into a complete dead-end of our economy and, in order to pay for it, we have to have things like 20% VAT, monstrous income tax and monstrous national insurance, which actually hamstring the economy from recovering. The only way out of this terrible mess is growth, and we do just about everything we can possibly do here to stop the economy growing. If it is not social welfare, it is corporate welfare. We have a sort of crony capitalism. We do not have real capitalism; it is crony capitalism. I have got landowning friends in Yorkshire, with 1 000 acres of mixed, who get GBP 100 000 a year and a single farm payment. They shove a couple of windmills on it and they are getting GBP 200 000 a year before they get out of bed. Of course people are in food poverty with this crazy system. For goodness sake, get rid of regulation, get rid of tax and free the thing up from this stranglehold, this cancer in society of welfare and get our young people back to work. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –  
Madam President, Commissioner, I rise again, I am afraid, to make the same old hoary speech that I have been making here for several years. That is: it is my opinion that you do not really understand the concept of banking. All the banks are broke. Bank Santander, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland: they are all broke. And why are they broke? It is not an act of God; it is not some sort of tsunami. They are broke because we have a system called fractional reserve banking, which means that banks can lend money that they do not actually have. It is a criminal scandal and it has been going on for too long. To add to that problem you have moral hazard – a very significant moral hazard – from the political sphere, and most of the problems start in politics and central banks, which are part of the same political system. We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitative easing, but counterfeiting  by any other name – the artificial printing of money for which, if any ordinary person did it,  they would be sent to prison for a very long time. Yet governments and central banks do it all the time. Central banks repress the amount of interest rates so we do not have the real cost of money, and yet we blame the retail banks for manipulating the LIBOR rate. The sheer effrontery of this is quite astonishing. It is central banks that manipulate interest rates, Commissioner. Plus, underneath all this, we talk loosely – in a rather cavalier fashion, do we not – about deposit guarantees. So when banks go broke through their own incompetence and chicanery, the taxpayer picks up the tab. It is theft from the taxpayer. Until we start sending bankers – and I include central bankers and politicians – to prison for this outrage, it will continue. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, what we are dealing with here is a triumph of hope over experience. We are talking about things which are not the problem; the problem which we have is a flawed banking system – a fractional reserve banking system where bankers can lend money that they do not have. If you go back in time to the United States in the 1850s, that was a capital offence. You could hang for it. We have this extraordinary situation where we have had regulation – lots of regulation – which has been the wrong sort of regulation, has it not? And so we have had another disaster. None of this is actually going to save us from another disaster further down the line. It is bound to happen, because we have not addressed the real problems, and that is the EU’s fractional reserve banking system. We must have a commodity bank on the one hand and an investment bank on the other. So, Commissioner, you talk about the banks’ ability to withstand shocks. Well, by that definition – by your definition – a shock is people turning up wanting their money back. That is not a shock; that should be a day-to-day occurrence and should be dealt with accordingly. We are talking about bankers’ bonuses, which is an absolutely wonderful way of taking everybody’s eye off the ball. What we have actually had here is criminal activity by banks – and not a single banker has been sent to prison. That is extraordinary: billions of pounds have been taken away from taxpayers, taken away from depositors and bondholders, and yet not a single banker is in jail. That is a disgrace! We really have to use the law of the land, not so much regulation and printing money – and central banks are equally culpable, make no mistake. I would like to see some central bankers in prison. I call ‘quantitative easing’ counterfeiting. Printing money is counterfeiting. It is illegal; if a private citizen did it, they would go to jail. So let us look into our own hearts. All the very unpleasant arrangements that politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers have between them at the expense of the taxpayer, let us end them and let us end them now. Godfrey Bloom,

Madam President, Commissioner. You know, Mr Draghi, that I am always impressed by your totally non-compromising support for the euro, doomed though we all now know it to be. It appeals to this certain Englishman – there is a sort of Shakespearian quality, I have to say: Lear-like. It puts me in mind of his great speech: ‘I will do such things, – What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be the Terrors of the earth’. Can I make a plea for my friends and their families in Cyprus? A micro-brewer who had his savings in a bank to start a micro-brewing company – not a rich man at all, but of course it was more than EUR 100 000, because it was his life savings. A retired British army officer whose life savings have now all but disappeared in the great Cypriot bank heist. Of course the big boys got their money out early, didn’t they? It is always the little people who get shafted, isn’t it? I am not totally convinced that you really care about them. Can you give me an assurance that you will do whatever it takes to get these poor people’s money back? We now have a situation which the previous speaker, Mr Eppink, alluded to quite rightly: the FED, the Bank of England, the ECB and the Bank of Japan are all completely bankrupt, and they are holding mountains of junk bonds bought with counterfeit money. Let us all blame the retail banks – but it is the central banks where the cancer starts. Politicians, bankers and lackey bureaucrats should be arraigned at an international financial tribunal in The Hague in the same way as war criminals.

 Let me assure you that United Kingdom politicians and central bankers are no less stupid than the people out here or the people in Washington. Believe me, they disgust me just as much. They have absolutely no idea, and they are bankrupting the United Kingom just the same way this organisation is bankrupting Western Europe. Yes, I take your point very well. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

 Mr President, well what do we know about carbon dioxide? Not carbon – carbon dioxide is a different thing for those people in this Chamber who have not had the benefit of a formal education. They are different things. We know that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere always follows periods of global warming. We know, do we not, that the hypothesis that man-made global warming was going to cause totally apocryphal boiling in 2050 now is completely nonsense. The hypothesis is dead in the water. It is facedown. There has been no statistically significant global warming now for over fifteen years. There is not a single independent scientific institution which does not acknowledge that fact. So all this debate is a lot of nonsense, because it simply is not happening. And Commissioner, you say that the weather is getting worse and worse; that climate change is getting worse. Madam, where have you been? It has not been. Why are you in denial? You are in denial! If I may lapse into the vernacular of the loony Greenies and their fellow travellers on this complete money-making nonsense: denier! Denier! (The speaker declined to answer blue-card questions from Mr Davies and Mr Jørgensen) Godfrey Bloom,

. – 
Mr President, let us look at VAT, shall we? What is it really? Well, of course it is a tax, so it is just a form of extortion by the State confiscating money from ordinary working people for the State to spend on itself. It is bureaucracy, politicians, subsidies for cronies and donors to party funds. The tax is regressive and monstrous – 20 % in the United Kingdom. It is inflationary, obviously, with 20 % on all goods. It is closing down retailers in the high street. Manufacturers are on three-day weeks. In the UK manufacturing has fallen 35 % in the last few years.  And what a silly tax it is. It is paid and reclaimed throughout the life of a transaction. It is not applied when value is added, whatever that may mean, but at the end so the customer pays it or simply withdraws his custom. So you get a recession. Notwithstanding the draconian powers given to VAT collectors, worthy of the old East German secret police – and I know some of you want to bring that back – fraud is rife. As criminals are always more clever than politicians – hey, what is the difference? – fraud will remain. If you really want to get rid of fraud, get rid of the tax. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

blue-card question
. –
 Thank you for taking the question. I just thought that as we are talking about waking up and we are talking about climate change, I would draw it to your attention – you keep missing the point I think – that there is no scientific institution now in the world which does not accept that there has been no significance statistical climate change since 1995. I am just wondering when you are going actually to wake up to that fact? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, I get the impression that Members think that if they use the word ‘growth’ enough, it will somehow magically manifest itself. The reason that growth is unacceptably low is actually quite simple, as anybody from the Pacific Rim could tell us. The reason it is low is that we are overtaxed, overregulated and over-governed. Most Members of this House and the Commission have never had a job in the commercial sector. This is an Achilles’ heel of gargantuan proportions. We have a suicidal energy policy. Employment legislation makes it impossible to employ anybody, especially small businesses and particularly young people. There will be no economic growth until we can close down this place, and the Commission. This is part of the problem. We are the problem and not the solution. Yet perhaps it will close itself down. Perhaps, and maybe sooner than we think. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Mr President, we are very interested to see how people vote on what is a very important subject. I draw your attention to Rule 161(5). A little transparency, even in this place, would not go amiss. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Mr President, this is a very complicated subject. Of course the credit rating agencies were not blameless in the subprime crisis, nor in the credit crunch that followed. Lord knows I have castigated them in this Chamber enough, but since 2008 they have improved. They have been honest with the markets about the worthless government debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, if not yet the United Kingdom and the United States.  But are we to crush the rating agencies with regulation?  Recall how they rate government debt: you require the rating agencies to get the prior approval of the regulator, ESMA, for their methodologies so that you can manipulate the calculations behind the scenes. Then, in order to control when they publicise their work, you force the rating agencies to disclose to ESMA the dates on which they are going to provide ratings on government debt and to limit those dates to three times a year. This is so that you will not suffer the embarrassment of a downgrade or negative outlook just before a critical auction of government paper. Then, to control where the rating agencies work, you insist that some of the work is done in the jurisdiction of government debt so that you can intimidate the analysts in the same way that the offices of credit rating agencies have been raided by government bodies in places such as Italy. Then, to control who does the work, you insist not only on the rotation of credit rating agencies themselves, but also on the individual analysts who work and have experience on particular debt and the assets that back them. Finally, to control the purpose of providing credit ratings, you seek to remove references to and reliance upon ratings, both within the workings of government and in private investment funds. Much of this is actually an attack on free speech. The world is watching you, frankly. Can you be trusted? I believe that this is a regulation to castrate the rating agencies and turn them into government eunuchs to vainly protect the chastity of the euro, a currency born out of wedlock and without a dowry. I fear that we will find ourselves back exactly in the position where we started. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I rise somewhat wearily to explain yet again the banking crisis to this House. Banks lend long, but borrow short. Central banks encourage malpractice by printing money – counterfeiting by any other name. Politicians use this fake money to prop up corporate and social welfare, basically bribing people with their own money. Financial regulation has become a shield to protect crooked bankers, while politicians, central and commercial banks spend money they do not have. The problem will simply fester. So what of banking union? Will national parliaments have any say? I take this opportunity to ask, as there are British Conservative colleagues in the House tonight, will Cameron stop this? Will he invoke Article 127 of the TEU or will he, as form suggests, sit like a paralysed rabbit in the EU’s headlights? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a financial transaction tax sounds like a very good idea, does it not? It plays well politically, and we can hit those greedy bankers, whom we all hate in public while we shovel money into their pockets in private. However, I do not think it is quite going to work out that way. All taxes are passed on to customers at the end of the day – sorry everybody, but that is just how it works – so again it will be the little people who pick up the tab. It will be savers, it will be pensioners and it will be ordinary folk who pick up the tab for this tax, not the greedy fat-cat bankers that you are trying to get at. It is interesting, when you look at the small print, to see they are saying that some of the money raised can perhaps go towards saving future failed banks. So we know – we concede, do we not? – that more banks are going to fail. We know this because we have the same ridiculous, fractional-reserve banking system, the same crooked, money-printing, criminal behaviour at the central banks, and so on and so forth. So nothing has changed. This is another strong signal to bankers and politicians to continue the theft. But beware those who think that taxing London is a risk-free game – and we mean London don’t we? When it comes to financial services, other EU countries are Mickey Mouse. Financial services account for 14% of UK GDP, and the UK contributes GBP 50 million pounds a day to this crumbling institution. Do not kill the goose that lays your golden eggs! Zurich, Geneva, New York and Hong Kong are licking their lips wondering what piece of glorious stupidity we will come up with next. An FTT is a special tax, so what next? A special tax on sunshine holidays in Spain; high fashion in Paris; luxury cars in Germany; mobile phones in Finland; and perhaps a justifiably special tax on dreadful flat-pack furniture from Sweden? It is coming to your street next! The greedy bureaucrats just want your money. (Applause)

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr Maňka, no, the problem we have is fractional-reserve banking, which means that banks lend money that they do not have, and that central banks and politicians print money, degrading currency. That is your problem. It is not regulation, it is not taxation. It is because of criminal behaviour, frankly, at the world’s central banks. Until that stops, nothing is going to change. There are a lot more bank failures coming down the road, believe me. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, harmonised taxation is simply a ploy to enable bureaucrats to steal even more money from the wealth-creating sector. Like vampires, they prey upon ordinary folk, sucking the lifeblood out of the economy – and for what? Tax-free salaries, non-contributive pension schemes, winter sunshine trips to Durban and Cancún, suicidal remote energy policies and constant rescue packages for failed banks. Without tax competition, Europe would be bled white in pursuit of a maniacal political crusade. High tax would banish manufacturing to the Far East, the Indian subcontinent and North America. The Baltic States, Ireland and fellow entrepreneurial ex-Warsaw Pact countries would slip back into the abyss. Athens and Madrid would become Dublin and Warsaw, but I suspect that before that time, ordinary folk will have cried enough and the parasites will have to head for the hills, as well they may. For certain the Irish, I suspect, will have their own way of dealing with them when they eventually awake from their slumber. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, in the 1970s the Community Reinvestment Act in the United States made due diligence in banking illegal. To pursue a political goal, the Administration laid open the pathway to what we now know as sub-prime debt. It proved to be – as I said it would at the time – a pathway to hell paved with good intentions. It was conceived to make banks lend to people who could not possibly repay. We politicians now love to blame the banks, but it started with politics. Sadly, politicians do not understand money. How else could we have got ourselves into this appalling mess? Yet we have learnt nothing; we are now advocating a form of Eurobond, a sub-prime debt instrument by any other name. Again, we are bailing out the banks at the expense of the taxpayer. The ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed are all at it: print money; give it to the banks to buy junk bonds – bogusly rated as double A – to shore up their reserves and guarantee salaries and bonuses that ordinary people can only wonder at. We have learnt nothing from the 2008 crisis. We are desperately clinging to a failed political ideal as our cities riot and burn. The day must surely come when politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers must be called to account by a fiscal crimes tribunal and sent to prison for a very long time. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Mr President, as a supporter and sponsor of Cambridge University’s Ladies’ Rugby Club for, I guess, 15 to 20 years, I wonder whether they should wear the logo on the front of their shirts or on the back? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I hope I may call you ‘shipmate’ in private! I would like to welcome the President of the Bank and to thank him for turning up, even if nobody else has. I have read this report, unlike most of my colleagues probably: power to suspend credit ratings, a European Monetary Fund to exclude the IMF, a single European Treasury issuing eurobonds and a single European Finance Minister, all of which, of course, would be unelected. It is a manifesto for European economic dictatorship, which is why I rather suspect the British Conservative Party will welcome it with open arms. If they do not vote for it, they will abstain in a marked manner, as they usually do, and talk a good story back in London. The President of the Bank reminds me a little bit of the poem by Siegfried Sassoon, the great war poet: ‘He’s a cheery old card’ said Harry to Jack, ‘As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack, But he did for them both with his plan of attack’. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, Ms Gáll-Pelcz mentioned the purchase of risky assets and I am a little bit confused. I am a professional economist. With whose money would you buy these risky assets? With whose money? Where would you get the money? Is it from old age pensioners in Yorkshire – my constituency – on GBP 100 per week? Where are you going to get the money to save this already failed project? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I certainly do not want it to fail but there is a feeling in the House that we have been hit by an asteroid or a tsunami, that this is not a problem of our own making. The reason the country and the European Union is in a shambles over the euro is of our own making: we have brought this upon ourselves. It is not an act of God. When will this House wake up to the fact we have done it to ourselves? Wake up, I beg you! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, one thing we do know about climate is that it is a pretty odd old thing. We know that it was warmer on the globe in the Holocene period; we know it was warmer in the Roman period; we also know it was warmer in the medieval period. It was cooler in the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century. We also know there has been no significant change in climate over the last 6 000 years and we also know that most scientific organisations have confirmed that there has been no significant statistical global warming in the last 15 years? I have these figures in front of me. They are the same figures that Mr Davies quoted. He is very careful in what he selects. What I would like to suggest before everybody disappears to Durban, saving the world as they travel on first class airfares and sip their martinis in expensive hotels, is that I have old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week … and you are picking up the tab. I would suggest, given this fiscal crisis that we have, that it would be a nice gesture – particularly from you, Commissioner, who does not pay much income tax and is on a very good salary – for you to offer to pay for your own trip. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, it is a shame that the Commissioner has gone. He would learn so much from me, since, unlike most of the people here, I actually have commercial experience. I have actually run companies. I actually know what I am talking about. I am going to talk about jobs now. We have 40% youth unemployment in parts of the European Union, and it is being suggested by people here that this is some sort of act of God. It is not an act of God: it is sheer, unadulterated incompetence. Look at what the EU is doing. Look at the barriers it is putting in front of companies, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, preventing them from employing people. We have minimum wages. We have pensions. We have holiday entitlements. We have a job tax – called national insurance in my country – which is absolutely huge, so the employee does not actually get half the money that is being paid by the employer. Trying to get rid of lazy and incompetent workers is virtually impossible, so sacking people is very difficult. And if you cannot hire, you cannot fire, so you lose flexibility. We have maternity leave, paternity leave, stress leave and all the rest of the nonsense that is invented by people here who have absolutely no commercial experience at all. It is not an accident that we have 40% of our young people unemployed: it is your fault. And let me remind you of liberty of contract. In a free society, we should have liberty of contract so that an employer and an employee can get together, sign a contract and get on with their lives without interference from this place. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Madam President, Mr Sturdy is an eminent businessman very close to where I live. He is one of the few exceptions and I apologise to him. (Laughter) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Madam President, I rise with some humility as representing a country which managed to elect a Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, a Scotsman, the only Scotsman in the world who actually does not care how much money he spends: it is an interesting phenomenon! So as I say, I rise with some humility. However, I look forward with the great British sense of humour which is one thing nobody can take away from us in this place which gave us an energy policy, an employment policy, a fisheries policy, an agricultural policy that have been – as almost everything that this place has done has been – a complete and total disaster. We are now contemplating a response to disasters, most of which of course we create for ourselves in this place. So I can say I look forward to seeing how this develops, how it goes forward in the future, and I am just interested to see what kind of pig’s breakfast you are going to make of this one! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I am a baby boomer. I was born just after the war. From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally. I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on – largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned. I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard. It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt. Let me explain, because I do not think you really understand. It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation – more money than they can possibly raise in taxation –, most of which, in point of fact, they actually waste. The reason we are talking about countries which are broke – and they are broke – is because their ridiculous, ineffective, ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise. Then they borrow, and they borrow, and – worse – they then print money, because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money. If you do that as a private citizen, it is a criminal offence. You would go to prison for that, yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time. Let me explain to you that these countries are broke. They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians. It is immoral – immoral! – to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks. They have defaulted. They are broke. For God’s sake, let us all admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Absolutely right. I was not suggesting my politicians were any less stupid than anybody else. It is an absolute disgrace, and there was not even a debate in our national parliament on actually rescuing these bust banks. If you want to invest in bust banks, do so with your own money, not money from my old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week, you scoundrels! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I rise before the House today to mention one or two things which might perhaps be of help. I spent 35 years as an investment banker, investment manager, investment adviser and economic strategist, and I never bought a dud bank in my life. I never bought a dud bank for my clients, but over the past few years, I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head, as a taxpayer, and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at. These are not even British dud banks, they are foreign dud banks, and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal. If I want to invest overseas, I will buy an emerging markets fund. I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force. I say ‘Mickey Mouse bank’, Mr Maystadt, because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life. I do not know where you get your advice from, but statistically, the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years, so what are you going to shovel all this money into? I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people. I would counsel you, if you want to keep your AAA status, to ignore the pleas of this House – full of eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives – in particular, in relation to paragraph 48 of the report. Solar panels in the land of the wildebeest, giraffe and bongo drum will lose you your AAA rating in no time at all. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, I would like to go back to the matter of Libya if I may. When did the political class and the great and the good suddenly catch up with the fact that Colonel Gaddafi is an evil man? When, since that wonderful photograph with you embracing him, Mr President, did you suddenly come to realise that he was a “wrong’un”? I can tell you that the victims of Lockerbie in Scotland and the victims of IRA atrocities in my country knew very well what sort of scoundrel this man was. But he has got oil and he has got money so you all turned a blind eye, didn’t you? Well, the chickens have come home to roost. The most absurd figure in all this is the British Prime Minister, who stands there rattling his empty scabbard – having disestablished the Royal Navy, having disestablished the Royal Air Force – making threats from the sidelines, with no aircraft carriers, nothing, and calls himself a Conservative but is just a superannuated schoolboy whistling in the dark. We talk a great deal about violence against the people, we talk a lot about democracy. And yet we have had a homicidal baboon in Zimbabwe for years now, and we do not do anything about it, do we? We do not care because there is no money and there is no oil. That is so typical of this place: full of hypocrisy and humbug. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have been here six and a half years, and, my goodness, I have heard some nonsense. But I have not heard so much nonsense spoken as I have today. Many years ago, I used to lecture on this subject at Cambridge University, and I would suggest that you would do well to read some of my old lecture notes. None of you, it appears, seems to understand the concept of international money. Herr Brok, who has not come off the phone since he came in only to listen to himself, was rather interesting. He started off this debate by suggesting it was a great success – the euro. One wonders what planet Herr Brok lives on. Dear oh dear! It is a complete disaster. If he thinks it is such a success, I would argue that he speak to the millions of unemployed people, youngsters mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the rest of Europe, who are suffering from this disgraceful, fraudulent and deceitful currency which was rammed down the throats of the people of Europe against their will. There is no mandate, Mr Duff. There is no mandate, with your blue card hanging up there, let me tell you. There is no mandate for this. The British people have not been given a vote on this whole shebang of European Union, and neither has anybody else. There is only one way this ridiculous currency spanning many different economies against a whole background of failed ideals can survive – and if you understood international money to any degree, you would understand this – and that is by having a financial, central, statist fiscal policy. If you think you have a mandate for that, you are a disgrace and a scoundrel. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I have to say to Mr Duff that at the time, in the mid-1990s, some of the class greeted my views with some scepticism. I still now go back to the occasional reunion dinner and most of them come up to me and say, ‘My god, Godders, you were right’. And I am, by god! I was right in spades, was I not? (Applause) Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, there is a lot of self-congratulation going on here in the European Union on International Women’s Day. It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog’s breakfast of it. You talk about maternity leave. All that is happening with draconian maternity leave, let me tell you, Madam, is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business. So you have done them no favours. We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court, which means that even if young women could get a job, they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled. And now you are talking about quotas. What kind of madness is this? Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business – professional women – are being patronised on quotas. Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say, are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business? The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this is simply not true and is not borne out by the statistics in my country. Speak to any small businessman you like in my country. I am not interested in the honourable Member’s country or other people’s countries, I am interested in my country and my economy, and I can tell you that all businessmen and women will say that they will not employ young women because of the draconian maternity laws. I wish, I desperately wish, you would come into the real world; hands up any of you who have had a real job! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Oviir, I would simply counsel her to let companies do their business. The less you regulate, the less you tax, the less you interfere, the quicker our economy will recover. That is what it is all about, and that is something the honourable Member does not understand. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Estrela, I can assure her that the problem with my country is that we have given up self-government and we are Members of the European Union: that is my country’s problem. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki, I would say that I believe that children are the responsibility of their parents and nobody else. I do not accept that somebody takes responsibility for his neighbour’s children. It is for the parents to take responsibility for their children and that is how it should be. The more self-responsibility we had in Europe – and indeed, the world – the better it would be, in my view. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– The views expressed by Herr Schulz meet the case. He is an undemocratic fascist. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, yet again there is one rule for Herr Schulz and one rule for everybody else. This is a disgrace. I have been elected – re-elected – to vote in this Chamber by the people of Yorkshire (your own constituency, I might add), with a democratic mandate which you yourself do not enjoy, Mr President, because you switched parties and they voted for the Conservatives. I have no intention of apologising, I have no intention of leaving this Chamber: you must have me escorted out, Sir! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, about five and a half years ago, I caused something of a furore by suggesting that any small businessman with his brain in the right place would be mad to employ a woman of childbearing age. Since then, it has got worse and worse as the balance in favour of employees versus employers has got completely out of control. One of my constituents from York wrote to me last year saying never mind about employing women of childbearing age, any small businessmen who employs anybody has got to be out of his mind. We have an extraordinary situation here, do we not? We have young women desperately keen to get into work, desperately keen to work for companies, especially small companies – which are the driving force of the United Kingdom economy – and we have employers who are too terrified to take them on. That is the problem we have. We are making it – here in this place with so little commercial experience amongst our Members – almost impossible for small businesses to employ young women, which is something they want to do. I used to think it was some sort of Chinese conspiracy where this place made it almost impossible for a European economy to function, and that behind the scenes the Chinese were making it so bad that eventually we had to import absolutely everything from China. Well, I have another hypothesis here, namely, that perhaps the women who are making it so difficult in committees, in the Commission and in this place for small businesses to employ young women have an eye to the main chance. I would suggest that when the electorate quite rightly look at them and boot them out in a few years’ time for their incompetence and their stupidity, they will only be able to get back into the workplace because they are in middle or late middle age. The game will be cleared for them. That is my hypothesis. I can think of no other sensible answer to this sort of ludicrous interference between employer and employee. If you think that is a weird hypothesis, anything that puts up with the way you talk about climate change, believe me, nothing is too stupid for this Chamber. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, when last I met the Commissioner, I expressed grave concern that regulation of the City of London was going to move to Brussels. He seemed surprised that I was so concerned, but since he has taken office, he might have come to understand that a significant portion of the United Kingdom’s GDP actually comes from its financial services sector. It is very important to the United Kingdom. Indeed, it picks up most of the tabs. The GBP 45 million a day we send to this place to support the rather suspicious European Union project, which has not given any of our electorate an actual say, is one of those tabs. In fact, you must understand that big salaries and big pensions do not grow on trees. Commissioner, I also mentioned to you that we could learn something from the old dominions – Australia, Canada – who have not suffered from this problem, and you rather charmingly, and in a very Gallic way, suggested that Australia was a long way away. I hope, now that you have been in office for a little while, you will understand that perhaps such a parochial approach will not do. I still worry, Commissioner. I still fret that we will have regulation from the usual mishmash of ignorant bureaucrats, parliamentary committees with their usual complement of cryptocommunists, anachronistic socialists, journeymen politicians, fringe greenies, a sprinkling of well-meaning housewives, and grandmothers exploring their new third age. The outcome will be the same as all the other EU projects: fishing, agriculture, energy, employment, immigration and, horror of horrors, the ticking time bomb of the single currency. It is an astonishing litany, is it not, of failure? You would think the European Union would get something right once by accident. I am sorry, but I am not satisfied. I am desperately cross that the British Conservative Party has given away the City of London regulation. If Dave Cameron had been the Admiral at Trafalgar, it would be Admiral Villeneuve on the plinth in Trafalgar Square now. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Commissioners – the three amigos if I may call you such – last session, Mr President, you had to scamper away. I think you had an urgent appointment. You missed my words of wisdom and I am glad to see that you are here to receive them today because I feel I have some wisdom to offer. You are in such a pickle actually, are you not? One could almost feel sorry for you but of course, you know, you bring some of this on yourselves. The common currency experiment – which is an experiment that was doomed to failure; I remember lecturing at Cambridge University back in the 1990s, explaining why it was deeply flawed and could not work and I gave it about 10 years and I am afraid it looks as though I was right – was flawed even by your own rule book. What in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book. You threw it away! You welcomed every fiscal dysfunctional economy into the eurozone, including Greece – which was going to hasten the demise of the eurozone, and it thus comes as no surprise. I am not a johnny-come-lately to the demise of the euro. It was always written in the runes, as it were. To suggest now that we have only just found out that Greece was broke is intellectually dishonest. I was in the City at the time and we were buying Greek bonds at 10% coupons, they fell to five and it was a one-way bet – a bit like having the winner of the horse before the race had even started! Our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy junk debt. They redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple A ratings. What are our central banks doing now? The very same thing. They are buying in the secondary market and buying junk bonds, repackaging them as triple A. This is just how we got into this pickle to start with. If you want to get out of this mess, you need to get rid of the political-establishment support for commercial banks and get rid of central banks, which are actually part of the problem, not the solution. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment. He who pays the piper calls the tune. It inevitably led to misgrading. Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet. They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all. Paradoxically, it is usually the hedge funds who find out the truth behind the numbers. They exposed Enron, for example. But the truth about numbers can be unpopular, especially here, which is why we hate them. However, even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke. Kaput
 is kaput
 in any language! So what does this House propose? Our own credit rating agency paid for by us, guaranteed to dance to our tune. It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone’s failed economies. The question is, who would these fool? I suggest, with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents, virtually nobody. When the people of Europe realise that they have been the guinea pigs in a gigantic failed currency experiment, they will burn this place down and guillotine the lot of us, and who could blame them? Godfrey Bloom,

 Madam President, it is a shame that Mr Barroso has fled the Chamber. I feel he would have learned so much from me this evening! I would counsel you all not to worry too much about the EU in 2020 because I rather fancy it will not be here! It will go the same way as the Soviet Union which it so resembles, and for the same reasons: it is centralised; it is corrupt; it is undemocratic and it is incompetent; it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats; it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as ‘climate change’. Whenever the people of Europe get the chance of a referendum, they reject it. The British, of course, have not been given the chance to have their say, thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country, aided and abetted by an EU-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the BBC. The EU is already crumbling. The scenes in Greece today will spread through the other Mediterranean countries sooner than we can imagine, and they will eventually reach northern European countries, which are being left to pick up the tab. Our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I appear to have been living in some sort of parallel universe here, hearing about the success of the euro. Let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we? Unemployment, youth unemployment in the Iberian Peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic. It has been at 30-40% for years. Nothing to do with the crisis at all. A complete disaster. GDP per capita in the USA is miles ahead of the European Union. GDP in the Pacific Rim is miles ahead of the GDP in the Union. No, the euro has not been successful at all. It is already failing. It is already crumbling before our eyes. Just look at some economic basics. There is no lender of last resort, which is why we have this Greek crisis and a Portuguese crisis round the corner. There is no lender. This is impossible in global, in currency management, whether it is an optimal currency zone or not. There is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak. Let me just remind everybody here about something else if I may. There are two sorts of people: wealth creators, those people that go out and work in the private sector and create wealth, and there are the others who spend wealth, which are politicians and bureaucrats and there are too many of us. Far too many of us. We are the monkey on the economies’ back and, until these currency zones start cutting down public sector spending, it is going to get worse and worse and worse. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, a few weeks ago, my estimable friend and Yorkshire colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, brought the chairman of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to this assembly and presented him as a legend in his own lunchtime and a top climate science guru – and I have to say that he certainly looked like a guru to me – but it turns out that he is a railway engineer who writes mucky books. Now, I have nothing against railway engineers. Some of my best friends are railway engineers and no doubt they read mucky books – that is not the point – but it might explain perhaps, does it not, why the IPCC has come out with so much absurd nonsense in the last few years. Would it not be a good idea if the Commission, perhaps, were to write to the IPCC and suggest they get a new chairman, perhaps a tad better qualified? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, taxation as a concept has not really changed very much in the last 3 000 years, has it? The rich and the powerful stealing money from ordinary people to make their own lives more comfortable. Where there has been a change in modern times is that now taxation is ‘for the benefit of the taxed’: that somehow we are being taxed pro bono
. In order to perpetuate this myth, we invent periodic scares to frighten people into submission. The latest of these scares is of course that, if we do not cough up green taxes, we will all boil to death – reminiscent of the medieval religions, is it not, which played the same game: pay up or burn in hell. Tax harmonisation is a concept dreamed up by the modern political class to make sure that no government steals too little from its people: a sort of thieves’ cartel if you will. May I suggest, if you really want tax harmonisation, that the Commission and the bureaucracy pay the same taxes as the electorate, that they bear the same burden of tax as the rest of us, before the electorate storm this building and hang us from the rafters, as they have every right to do. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, you can, of course, tell that I am a sceptic because I do not dress like a scarecrow. I fought my way through the blizzard in Copenhagen, like many of you did. It is interesting, is it not, that we have had the coldest winter so far on record in London for 30 years? It is the same in Poland, Korea and China. We have had the coldest temperatures in Florida, Arizona, Texas – the first snow in Texas, I think, for a hundred years. Of course, as Giles Coren of the London Times
 said, my goodness me, we simply do not get it – of course that is what global warming is all about: we have got to get used to freezing temperatures. Well, we have seen the Al Gore hockey stick, which is still, I gather, being shown in London state schools – Al Gore, snake oil salesman, crook! We have seen Professor Jones from the University of East Anglia – crook! And now – you will not know about this yet because it has been kept out of the public domain – the New Zealand National Climate Database: I have the figures here – all fraudulent. When are you all going to wake up? Scam, scam, scam! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Climate, Mr Davies, is what we all have to put up with. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I rise very quickly and on a point of order. You said a few minutes ago that you were bound by the rules, and what can you do when you are bound by the rules? I fully understand that, and so does the House. Can I assume, and can we assume, that you will be bound by the rules of this House for your whole term of office? Because your predecessor felt he was not bound by the rules, and on the basis of explanations of vote he tore the rule book up because he did not feel bound by it. I leave it with you, sir. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I take this opportunity of wishing well the east European cities in the coming of the very early skiing season, with the snow and ice that have come there. Of course, this is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, and temperatures have been broadly flat since 1998. So we are all talking here about something which is not happening. Time and time again I have heard Members here talk of CO2
 as a pollutant. A pollutant! It is a life-giving natural gas. It gives me the impression that some of our Members have not had the benefit of a formal education. Isn’t this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people’s trouser pockets to steal yet more tax from them? Isn’t this all about political control? Isn’t this all about politics and big business? The whole thing is a sham – this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2
 is causing global warming. Enough please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy. Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, the influx of workers into the UK must be controlled by the UK Government. It is a simple matter of sovereignty. Britain already has a housing shortage. Hospitals and schools are not coping with the ever-growing immigrant population. Britain must protect its own citizens who have paid their taxes and built the country. The massive influx of immigrants produces an oversupply, adding to the unemployment problem, reducing job availability and reducing pay for working people. And yet, here we are facing yet more rules. These rules take control away from UK authorities, making management of the infrastructure impossible. Britain has not discriminated against foreign workers, and those willing to integrate with the existing population have been accepted, but now enough is enough. You say the free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom of EU citizens, a cornerstone of the internal market. I say a fundamental right of the UK is to roll away this stone and gain independence from Europe. We need our independence now. Sadly, a great British trade unionist and defender of working people, Bob Crow, died today. I wish the Left would embrace his views in this debate. Mike Nattrass  (NI
). - 
 Mr President, the Fourth Railway Package removes choice and dictates how to run a railway. Currently, Member States choose to directly award public service contracts or organise competitive tenders. This is yet another EU one-size-fits-all imposition inflicted on the UK, stopping any government from even considering alternatives to the current failed UK privatised model of railways.  So this EU package imposes: one, a dramatic cost escalation due to fragmentation; two, tax increases due to private train company subsidies; three, passengers facing the highest rail fares in Europe; four, minimal investment because profits are given to shareholders instead of reinvesting.  Directly-operated railways on the East Coast mainline prove that publicly owned and operated railways deliver increased performance, with much lower subsidy than private operators. UK governments must have the freedom to implement alternative models in line with the interests of passengers and of taxpayers. The UK Government must run its own affairs without EU interference in UK sovereignty. All the UK really needs is independence. Mike Nattrass  (EFD
). - 
  Mr President, here we have more legislation from the EU sausage machine to waste UK civil servants’ time and confuse citizens. I have listened to debates on the length of chickens’ beaks, inquiries into how much wine there is in a wine[nbsp ]gum and facts about rotten fruit leading to drunken reindeer which then savage people. The message-tapping CIA must be bored out of their tiny minds. You would serve your countries better by staying at home and chewing cardboard. There was a time when the British thought the Italians were amusing: ignoring the rules after making so many. We now understand that an over-supply of silly rules leads to disrespect for the law, and pedestrian crossings become suitable only for those with a suicidal tendency. We have far too much law. EU rules are openly broken and are not enforced by the Commission. This puts those who obey the rules into an adverse trading position. The failure to enforce EU law on the size of chicken cages, causing problems with egg production, is just one very costly example. Should you have further rules and mad-cap ideas up your sleeves, I suggest you shove them up your armholes or, like the Italians, make love not law. UKIP backs Westminster as the place where UK law must be made. For these reasons, UKIP will vote against this new law. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, you will be aware that many in the UK object – object – to the imposed EU citizenship and do not want it. They love Europe but they hate the EU because it is dictatorial and undemocratic. The following letter from constituent Alan Sheath illustrates this point. ‘Dear Mr Nattrass, on 7 February 1992, Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty. Unbeknown to myself and the vast majority of British subjects, every person in the UK, including Her Majesty The Queen, became a European citizen by ratification. Neither I nor 60 million other British subjects were consulted or asked to vote. I do not want this citizenship, so please advise me what measures there are in place to renounce it. I remain content with my British birthright’. I see from the papers on this debate that the EU is now forcing the UK to wreck its social security systems by opening the floodgates to Europe and the UK is being forced to abide by the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We do not want foreign legal frameworks, so when can the British people have a democratic vote please? Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, between 1958 and 1976, Iceland fought the cod wars with Britain. Now, cod stocks are rising because of Icelandic fish management. Compare that with the former UK fishing grounds, now in EU hands. Lost and ruined. The UK’s European dream turned into a nightmare. Established fishing communities die when the EU boats move in. My message to Iceland is obvious. If you join, you will lose your fish, your freedom and your currency and there is no regard for quotas or regulations in the EU. For the love of cod, do not do this. Say no. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Madam President, increasing the independence and powers of national bodies is good. The failings of the railway package are laughable, and the share of freight being moved by rail has actually fallen since the first railway package in 2001. Are the EU regulations enforced? The Commission will not enforce the regulations on battery cages for hens, which may well force producers who have complied out of business. So what is this about enforcement? Will cash-strapped national governments pay their fines? Some pay fines then continue to break the same rule, because the annual revenue collected exceeds the amount of the annual EU fine. The Commission has taken 13 Member States to the European Court of Justice for failing to correctly implement various parts of the railway package. Was anything enforced? Here, the EU sought control over national policy-making decisions on railways: for example, stopping the political will to run nationalised railways. These are matters of national sovereignty and the freedom of the voters – not the EU. The report criticises Member States for lack of investment to meet this package, but we are in the middle of an economic crisis. The legislation does not require clarification or improvement. It clearly should be scrapped. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President: So the EU seeks to raise EU revenue by taxation on trucks? Well, I ask UK voters what they think of the EU and the usual answer is ‘I do not think we should join’. The UK has been politically taken over. UK law is made in Strasbourg, a monster red-tape factory is closing industry, and now we have tax but, because it is not football, the people are not informed. The UK media avoid EU reality, brains are fed with TV soaps and reporters say the EU does not affect local issues. The EU is not news. This report seeks to raise tax from tolls on trucks, partly funding the trans-European TEN-T project, which includes linking high-speed EU trains. So, when the EU raises taxes in the UK, will the people respond by kicking the EU in the ballot box? No, because they are not informed. The final EU superstate takeover by stealth will be a taxpayers’ sleepwalk into Europe. The defences are down, the press do not care and the UK is asleep, so get those unfortunate truckers taxed. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, Mrs Kalniete wants to relaunch the Single Market and makes it sound like a V-2 rocket: extremely dangerous but never on target. Mr Correia de Campos is concerned about movement of workers. Well, so am I. The EU has swamped the United Kingdom with extra workers. The United Kingdom sees the world as the market. The straightjacket of the EU regulation is closing our industry, stopping innovation when it is ahead of the regulations and closing traditional industry, where the product is good but different from the approved continental version. Small business is the victim here. The United Kingdom is amongst those which do comply, yet it suffers because it does: for example, expensive compliance in the pig and egg industries with regulations that the Commission will not enforce, making our product uncompetitive. I have many more examples, but have been allocated just one minute to save small businesses. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, in view of what we have just been speaking about, I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us. I would like your reassurance that the investigation into Brussels security breaches, some involving firearms, is being vigorously pursued. These breaches have put our staff, our guests and ourselves at serious risk. May I also have your assurance that senior management will be held accountable where appropriate, and that these soldiers will not be sacrificed in order to protect the generals? (Applause) Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages, but it is about the ability of the EU to oversee the single market. States were given 10 years to comply by 1 January 2012 or the product would be illegal. The Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, British and others have complied, but certain large producers have simply refused. This involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money. The regulation has put about 15 pence on a dozen eggs. Those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage. Eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the EU. One producer borrowed GBP 10 million to comply with this directive. He did the right thing. Is the Commission going to renege and make his eggs uncompetitive? If more time is given, then the moral of this story is that, if the EU makes a directive, it pays to ignore it. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, the Commission proposed this directive in 2008 and there were concerns about placing excessive burdens on the scientific research industry. The proposal will dilute certain restrictions and I note that the requirement for sharing animal research data has been removed. Some 12 million animals are being used in experiments in the EU each year and this proposal could increase their suffering. We must reduce the need for experimentation on animals. Civilised human beings will try to strike a balance between the need for research and the obligation to respect the lives of other creatures on this planet. These decisions require the wisdom of Solomon. I regret, I have to say, I have to ask the question: does the EU Parliament have such wisdom? Mike Nattrass,

 Madam President, the British public are aggressively against whaling. If Britain’s hands are tied to one harmonised EU abstention on whaling, it will guarantee a return to slaughter. The inhumane Japanese are giving incentives to Third World countries to stop: and look at the return to whaling. It is murder. The Japanese Government should be regarded as socially unacceptable for doing this in a modern world. The British were once heavily involved but have consigned the mistake to a previous century. If the UK is stopped by the EU from voting against this, while the Japanese and others murder these beautiful, sensitive and intelligent mammals, the UK public will vote to leave the EU in uncontrollable anger. It will be the kiss of death for Britain’s membership of the EU. John Stuart Agnew, Marta Andreasen, Gerard Batten, John Bufton and Mike Nattrass  (EFD

 While we recognise that Cuba is a Communist tyranny and while we want to see Cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state, we do not recognise the EU in this process. Mike Nattrass,

– Mr President, to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom, the UK Government has implemented the EU rail package. This is mainly because, these days, the Lib-Lab-Con sit at Westminster and like to be told what to do, having given away control to the EU. The separation of train operators and separation of the rail network is leading to major problems, courtesy of the EU. No wonder 21 countries are too wise to get caught in an EU rail web leading to mayhem on all stations to Brussels. I am not a Socialist, but if you need an integrated transport system, then state ownership is best – and not separation into multiple private hands. Having six different companies on the network between Birmingham and Berlin will create a complete ‘dog’s breakfast’, or should I say a ‘Dachshunds Frühstück
’. When Eurorail is broken up to allow the surplus capacity to be run by different companies, we will no longer have rolling stock, just laughing stock. Brian Simpson, who is responsible for this debate, is a member of the Labour Party. Labour was once Socialist, and he was elected by people who still think Labour is Socialist. Yet here he is, hiding in the EU, away from his faithful supporters. What is he calling for? He is calling for privatisation. More than that; he is calling for an EU model which does not work and is against the wishes of his own voters. He is, in fact, the ‘Fat Controller’, creating fat pay packets for fat cats. The one thing that we can be sure of is that there is fat chance that this EU directive will be accepted, as it will derail the EU rail network. Mike Nattrass,

– Madam President, I come from the West Midlands, the home of the so-called ‘Tipton Taliban’, who were detained at Guantánamo. As a UKIP MEP, I must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another, without judicial oversight, and to face foreign imprisonment, is an alien process. It is an affront to liberty, democracy, accountability and natural human rights. I can give you a list of British citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way, into squalid and unfit jails, not at the hands of the CIA and its rendition programme, but at the hands of the EU Member States under the European arrest warrant which this House created. It was made in the EU. So, before you condemn the USA, look in the mirror and see your own hypocrisy.

 Mr President, in his introduction President Barroso said that the First World War was an industrial war. Indeed, you have only got to drive two hours up the A4 motorway from here and visit the battlefield at Verdun to see exactly what he was talking about.  For those who have not visited, I think it is probably the grimmest battlefield on the Western Front or indeed anywhere in the world, and certainly the grimmest I have visited. It was something that had such a huge psychological effect on France that it very much dominated the thinking of Monnet and Schuman post-1945 – that this awful thing must never happen again. Those of us in politics will all remember that famous photograph of a quite large German Chancellor Kohl and a rather small French President Mitterrand holding hands, standing in front of the ossuary at Douaumont. The whole European project comes from the disaster that was sparked by the First World War. It is entirely understandable that people should have sought ways to prevent such awfulness. The difficulty is that they chose the wrong target. Monnet and Schuman decided – and this view is shared today by Mr Barroso, Mr[nbsp ]Cohn-Bendit and others – that it was the existence of the nation state that led to war and therefore we had to abolish the nation state. Actually, what we should have focused on, post-1945, was not the abolition of states, but making sure that the European states were democratic, because democratic nation states do not go to war with each other. So I have to say that I believe the whole European project is based on a falsehood. It is potentially a dangerous falsehood, because if you try to impose a new flag, a new anthem, president, army, police force, foreign policy – and whatever else – without first seeking the consent of the people, you are in danger actually of creating the very nationalisms and resentments that you sought to snuff out in the first place. We have done all this before. We did it after the First World War in the Balkans. We said that we could not have all these little Balkan states going around fighting with each other. We said that we should bring them together and give them one flag, one anthem and one president and call it Yugoslavia. It led to horrific wars from 1990 and the deaths of tens of thousands of people, as they fought to get out of a false state.  The European Union is making a very similar mistake, because there is no consent for this project. I have heard people this morning talking about the need for a United States of Europe on a federal model. You can only have that if people give consent for it, and nobody has done so. When the EU put the constitution to the peoples of Europe – the first time it really came clean with the electors – they rejected it.  I am not against Europe, but I am against this Europe. I want a Europe of independent, sovereign nation states that trade together, work together and cooperate together. I believe the European elections this year will mark a turning point. The tide is turning. The EU is backing an outdated model that seeks to get rid of a problem that actually has not existed since 1945. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, even by the standards of this place, today’s atmosphere has been leaden. A great global political leader, Mr Barroso, comes along and out of 750 Members, 44 people turn up to listen. Why is that? Well, I have noticed something: I have been here fifteen years, but in the last five years something really big has changed. The European dream is crumbling, absolutely crumbling. There are a few maniacs in the front row here and in your Commission who of course still want a United States of Europe, but actually out there in the Member States they do not. And most of the MEPs here, yes, they want a job, yes, they want to be re-elected, but the enthusiasm for this project is dying. Why? Well you have made two big mistakes. The first mistake was of course to extend the eurozone. It would have been OK had it just been Germany and a few northern European countries, but to bring the Mediterranean into the eurozone has been a disaster. The second mistake was to allow the free movement of people to southern and to Eastern Europe. We in the United Kingdom – who have been the most open country with regard to immigration of any European country through a history that has lasted hundreds of years – now have 4[nbsp ]000 migrants a week who come to Britain from the European Union and stay for a year or more. These are the two realities that have hit home to people: the EU does not work economically, and open-door migration is fundamentally changing societies in ways that people do not want. Listen to the economics. Mr Barroso, you talked today about the possibility of an industrial renaissance in Europe, which sounded good. Lighter-touch regulation – all very encouraging. And then you say: but we must pursue our climate-change carbon targets. The Americans have gone for shale gas and reduced energy prices. The Chinese are digging up coal in quantities we cannot fathom and building two coal-fired power stations every week. This policy of economic unilateralism on climate change is what is destroying jobs in Europe, and the electors are going to have a chance in 72 days’ time to give their verdict. I suspect the next European Parliament will be very much more exciting than this one has been this morning. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Had there been a proper question there, I might try to answer it. Euroscepticism is growing right across the European Union. Nobody here, not even the maniacs that believe in the project, would question that. It is coming in all shapes and forms. It is on the right, it is in the centre, and it is on the left. The reason is of course – and you come from Ireland, so you should know better than anybody – that actually no one has ever given consent for a political European Union. The French clearly – followed by the Dutch – rejected the Constitution. They rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty, and only one country had a referendum on that. That was Ireland, and the people of Ireland rejected it. So you cannot tell me that there is popular support for a United States of Europe. Mrs Reding may believe it, Mr Barroso may believe it, one or two in the front row may believe it, but the peoples of Europe do not believe it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I have sat here this morning feeling like the odd man out. To me it is beyond parody for the Greek Finance Minister, Mr Kourkoulas, to come along here and tell us our fortune: the policies are bearing fruit, we are going to tackle unemployment. And no-one says anything! No, because, of course, everybody here is tied up with the same obsession that the euro must and will work; the obsession that you will use the crisis to build a United States of Europe. What you could have told them, Mr[nbsp ]Kourkoulas, is that, according to the respected medical journal The Lancet
, there are now 800[nbsp ]000 people in Greece without access to welfare or medical care. You could have told them that. But even if you had, they would not have listened, so obsessed are they with building the euro. OK, a simple lesson in economics: when you have two countries that are at completely different stages of the economic cycle, one currency needs to devalue. But if those countries are pegged or tied inside the same currency and they cannot devalue, you have to devalue the country – and that is what is happening to the Mediterranean. We are devaluing the Mediterranean, and it is leaning towards Third World status. No amount of socialist state spending can mend this imbalance. It is about time, if people here cared for the citizens of Europe, particularly in the south, that we admitted the euro does not work for southern Europe and it is time we broke it up and gave countries currencies that reflect their current economic status.

 The point that the late Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, made is that it is tough enough to have an interest rate that works for Newcastle and London, let alone to have one that works across the whole of Europe, so there is a valid economic argument.  However, the taxpayers in London do not object strongly to transfers going to Newcastle or Scotland or wherever they may be needed because we are part of the same country. The problem you have with the euro area is not just this huge economic imbalance between north and south, but that increasingly the taxpayers of the north do not want to go on subsidising the south because there is no sense of European identity. We are very different countries. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I must congratulate you, Mr Samaras, for getting the Greek Presidency off to such a cracking start. I am sure your overnight successful negotiations in the trialogue on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) will have them dancing in the streets of Athens. No matter that your country, very poorly advised by Goldman Sachs, joined a currency which it was never suited to; no matter that 30 % are unemployed, that 60 % of young people are unemployed, that a neo-Nazi party is on the march, that there was a terrorist attack on the German embassy. No, do not worry about all that, because the trialogue on MiFID has been a success, and in many ways it sums up the two Europes: the Europe that is talked about in here by the dreamers, who want to impose a united states of Europe with an identity and currency, and the real world out there. And you come here, Mr Samaras, and tell us that you represent the sovereign will of the Greek people? Well, I am sorry, but you are not in charge of Greece, and I suggest you rename and rebrand your party. It is called New Democracy. I suggest you call it No Democracy, because Greece is now under foreign control. You cannot make any decisions, you have been bailed out and you have surrendered. Democracy: the thing your country invented in the first place, and you cannot admit that joining the euro was a mistake, because of course Mr Papandreou did that, didn’t he? He even said there should be a referendum in Greece – and within 48 hours the unholy trinity that now run this European Union had him removed and replaced by an ex-Goldman Sachs employee puppet. We are run now by big business, big banks and, in the shape of Mr Barroso, big bureaucrats, and that is what these European elections are really going to be all about. It is going to be a battle of national democracy versus EU state democracy. Whatever you may say in this Chamber, the people out there do not want a united states of Europe, they want a Europe of sovereign states trading and working together, and I believe the European elections are going to mark a watershed. Until now everybody has thought – much as they may not like the development of the European Union – that it was inevitable. That myth of inevitability will be shattered by the European elections this year. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, I know it is seasonal to talk about the 12 days of Christmas, but I want to talk about the 21-day count down to the opening of the doors to 29 million poor people from Romania and Bulgaria. It does, I think, mark a pivotal moment in British politics. Very often in Britain, MEPs complain that they do not have a high enough profile with the public. I want to try and change that today because Brigadier Geoffrey Van Orden sitting behind me here, British Conservative, was the rapporteur, the sponsor for Bulgaria joining the European Union and for us having a total open door to all of those people. So well done, Brigadier, I want all the British people to know who you are and what your achievements are and of course what free movement means – it means free health care; it means free education; it means free access to the benefit system; it means an open door to the criminal gangs and the modern day Fagins who will of course benefit from the fact that London is the most successful and wealthy international city in Europe. Already the situation is so bad that 92% of ATM crime in London last year was committed by Romanians. I am not scapegoating in any way and I know that a lot of people that come from Bulgaria and Romania will be very decent people who want to work hard and want to better their lives, but free movement does not work in the European Union now that we have countries that are poor. For a man that comes from Bucharest and works in London and gets child benefit for the two children back home: that child benefit is worth more than he can actually earn doing a menial job in Bucharest and that is the reason why the numbers that come to Britain will indeed be absolutely enormous. I have said for some time, and now the British people agree, enough is enough. 80% of the British people do not want those borders to come down in 21 days’ time. It is unfair. It is unfair on working people. It is leading to lower wages. It is leading to higher youth unemployment and it is leading to divided communities. But of course it does not end here, because our Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, with the full support of Labour and the Lib Dems, now wants to extend this principle of open borders, as he says himself, from the Atlantic to the Urals. So it means countries like Kazakhstan, indeed the Ukraine, joining the European Union. I see that Tony Blair is now helping Albania join the European Union. Well good luck to them with that. We even want to extend it to Turkey joining the European Union. Our message is that a turkey is just for Christmas; it is not for political union; we do not want open borders. And, Mr Cameron, do not, next week at the summit, surrender in any way to deeper European military integration. Many in this room would have bombed Syria had Europe had that capability. Thank God it did not. On open doors, on European armies, the voters will have their say next May, and I think there is going to be a radical change. I think there is going to be an earthquake in British politics next May. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr Brons, thank you for the question. Can I make something clear to you? UKIP is not against immigration. We welcome immigration. We want immigration; but we want an immigration system based, as the Australian one is, on saying we want people who have got skills to bring to our country. We do not want people who have got life-threatening diseases. We do not want people who have got criminal records – though of course in Australia, in the old days, that was a prerequisite – and we want to make our own decisions on who comes to Britain. We are not discriminatory, we are not scapegoating, we just want to control our own borders and live in our own democracy and we cannot do that as members of this European Union. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, there is only one real debate going on here this week in Strasbourg: it is the fear stalking the corridors, the concern you have got about the rise of euro-scepticism. Years ago you were less worried. The few of us here who were euro-sceptics were treated as being mentally ill and sort of patted on the head. Now we are evil populists; we are dangerous; we are going to bring down western civilisation. It is clear that you do not get it, you do not understand why this is happening. Well, let me help you. In 2005 it was the pivotal moment of this project: the French and the Dutch had said ‘No’ to the EU Constitution. Mr Barroso stood up and said: ‘They did not really vote ‘No’. They did not understand what they were doing’. But they did. You see, ever since 2005, the real European debate has been about identity. What we are saying – large numbers of us – from every single EU Member State is: ‘We do not want that flag. We do not want the anthem that you all stood so ramrod straight for yesterday. We do not want EU passports. We do not want political union’. If you think about it, there is nothing extreme about that position. There is nothing right-wing about that position; there is nothing left-wing, indeed, about that position. It is a normal, sensible assertion of identity. What we are saying on our side of the argument – you see, you can scream and shout all you like, which really rather proves to me why you are going to do so badly in the European elections next year, because you are not listening – we want to live and work and breathe in a Europe of nation-state democracy. We want to trade together, we want to cooperate together. We are happy to agree sensible common minimum standards and, yes, we want to control our own borders, which is the rational, logical and sensible thing for any nation state to do. We are not against immigration or immigrants. We believe there needs to be a degree of control, and that is the message that is picking up support right across this continent. I genuinely think that there is an opportunity for an electoral earthquake to happen in the European elections next year, with a large number of people from all sides of this House who will come with a nation state agenda, who will come saying: ‘Let us have a Europe, as de Gaulle might have said, of the patries
; let us not have a Europe of political union’. You can abuse us all you like, but what we stand for is fair, principled and democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, not one in a thousand British people would know who Commissioner Andor was. They would not be able to pick him out of a line-up and yet he is really rather powerful. He is the governor. He is the man who decides who can come to Britain and who can claim benefits. He has more power than a British Government Minister. But I have to thank him for his study, because he is the one who has told us that there are 600 000 economically-inactive Eastern Europeans in Britain – something our own government was not able to tell us. I suppose I have to admire his commitment to his job. After all he is going to take the UK Government to court to make sure that we do not treat Eastern Europeans any differently to our own people. So it is certain that he means business. I know that this is a very complex area, but let us just look at one in-work social benefit, shall we? Child benefit. From Eastern Europe, at the moment, there are people to whom we are now paying child benefit for 50 000 children who do not even live in the United Kingdom. There is no possible justification for us doing that. It is costing us GBP 1 million a week, and it is yet another pull factor. But of course, this whole issue is going to get bigger, because we appear to have learnt nothing from 2004. If you allow the unrestricted free flow of people between poor and rich countries, do not be surprised when you get a big result. We had a government prediction of 13 000 people a year, and it was something like 400 000 a year for the first two years. So we open the doors next year to Romania and Bulgaria. It means more oversupply in the unskilled labour market, a greater burden on the National Health Service and our schools and, yes – sadly – it is going to mean more crime too. This issue will be the central issue of the European elections next year. It will be the central issue of whether Britain remains a member of the European Union. We are not against anybody from Eastern Europe, but we do believe that it is right and proper that we should restrict and decide who comes to live in our country. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the problem is not just Mr Barroso but the entire unelected government of Europe – and perhaps there is a chance for our citizens to reflect on where the real power lies in this Union. I have listened to Mr Barroso for nearly 10 years and I give him full marks for consistency. He is a man who likes fixed ideology. He probably picked it up when he was a Communist or a Maoist, or whatever he was, and for the last 10 years he has pursued Euro-federalism combined with an increasing green obsession. And yes, it has been good! For bureaucrats, big businessmen and landowners it has not been a bad decade, but it has been a disaster for poor people, unemployed people and those on low wages. The euro, which you, Mr Barroso, believed would give us monetary stability, has done the very opposite. It was a misconstruction from the start and it is pretty clear that youth unemployment, at nearly 50% across the Mediterranean, is probably nearly double what it would have been, as a direct result of the misconstruction that is the euro. The countries in question are in the wrong currency, but I know that you will never admit to that. I think the euro will die a slow and painful death, but you are all in denial about that. However, it is the green agenda that I really find more interesting. You keep telling us, Mr Barroso, that climate change is an absolute top priority and you have been greeted with near-hysteria in this place over the last 10 years. Those of us who have been sceptical have been mocked, derided and called deniers. We argued from the start that the science was not settled, and we have argued very strongly that the measures we are taking to combat what may or not be a problem are damaging our citizens. We have been proved to be right. Tens of millions have been forced into fuel poverty; manufacturing industry is being driven away because our competitors in China and America are going for cheap fossil alternatives; and wind turbines are blighting the landscapes and seascapes of Europe. Yet still today you go on about green growth. Well, the consensus is breaking down behind you. Commissioner Tajani said the other day that we face a systematic industrial massacre. It is time to stop this stupidity. To help you, there is the NASA photograph taken last August of the northern ice caps and there is the NASA photograph of the ice caps taken this year. The ice has increased by 60% in one year. Leading American scientists are now saying that we are going into a period of between 15 and 30 years of global cooling. We may have made one of the biggest and most stupid collective mistakes in history by getting so worried about global warming. You can reverse this in the next seven or eight months. You can bring down people’s taxes. If you do not do so, they will vote on it in the European elections of next year.

 Oh no, I’m sorry, old son, I haven’t accused you of not working – far from that. I have accused you of doing far too much and actually, collectively in this House, forming a consensus, and I am going to come back to this green agenda. You all formed the view that carbon dioxide emissions were leading to rapid global warming and that it was the greatest crisis that has ever faced mankind, and therefore we had to start taxing carbon. There has been no global warming, Sir, for twenty years. The ice caps have grown significantly over the last twelve months, and I am making a positive proposal that would put back into work tens of thousands of people, and I am saying: let us scrap these climate levies and let us see where the science goes over the course of the next few years. I cannot think of a more positive thing that has been said in this House this morning. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, next year’s European election will not be contested on the old division lines of left and right and several group leaders have agreed with that today. Frankly, that is all irrelevant. It will be contested between those of us that believe in national democracy within the nation state and those that believe that the 28 countries that are part of the EU are better governed by these institutions. That in a sense is what this comes down to.  But, Mr Barroso, those of us that believe in national democracy do not want to take us back to the Western Front or 1914. Those of us that believe in national democracy will say to you it is a healthy assertion of identity, but it also shows a deeper understanding of why the problems of Europe were caused in the past. It is democratic nation states in Europe, that are stable, that will not go to war with each other, which are a force for good and I would remind people that, without the vote in the House of Commons two weeks ago, we would now be at war in Syria. What better proof can there be that nation state democracy can be a force for good? Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, I represent a group which is against military action in Syria. We are against it not because we are pacifists; we are against it not because we do not care about the awful things going on there. We are against it because we think there is some pretty poor thinking going on. The idea that somehow the rebels are the good guys and Assad’s regime are the bad guys really is an over-simplification of a situation in which we know that al-Qa’ida has significant representation amongst the rebel groups. Of course, we have seen it all before: an endless series of military adventures over the course of the last 10 to 15 years. One such, in Afghanistan, is still going on and is not achieving any of the original aims. I was worried when I heard the Americans telling us, to begin with, that it was about punishing Assad and then, within a week, that it was about regime change – a position which I know the noble Baroness herself supports. We think that firing a thousand cruise missiles is likely to make an unstable situation even worse than it is now. In a sense, Baroness Ashton, you are sitting pretty because, as the highest-paid female politician in the world, luckily you have a non-job because the EU, thank goodness, has not yet got a foreign policy and, as a result of that, what we saw two weeks ago in the UK House of Commons was a nation-state democracy standing up and saying something. As a direct result of that vote in the House of Commons, we have not gone to war in Syria: we have entered a period of negotiations and Assad has a chance to prove to all of us whether he is a good man or a bad man. I do not know how this will play out but at least, Mr Verhofstadt, there is a chance of peace, and I know that you represent the kind of political class who believe that global influence can be achieved only through bombing. Well, luckily – unlike extreme EU nationalists like yourself – British democracy has proved that nation-state parliaments can actually made people rethink. And, Mr President, I have to say, as somebody who has been here now for 14 years, it is ironic that the view which I used to represent was called extreme, but you can see who are the extreme militarists now.

The ‘good guys versus bad guys’ story is really something I take from your own Foreign Secretary and party member William Hague, who was urging the international community to arm the rebels – which struck me, given that we know of al-Qa’ida’s involvement, as total and utter madness. I will remain cynical and sceptical, like much of the European public, about who has used those weapons until we get the full report and we get the intelligence right. We went to war in Iraq being told that Saddam had weapons of … (Interjection to Mr Verhofstadt, who had been shouting objections: ‘Why don’t you shut up and listen for a change? You really must be the vilest, rudest man in European politics and you rant on and the Chair lets you get away with it because you are the former Prime Minister of Belgium. Well, there we are.’)
 So, Mr Tannock, I understand what you are saying. I understand that something ghastly has happened here, but before you take military action you need to be certain you are going to make things better and not worse.

But I am saying this: that whether it is through the use of gas, or whether it is through the use of other forms of high explosives or bullets, there are terrible things happening in Syria – I understand that and I agree – but rushing to war as we did in Afghanistan, as we did in Iraq, was a mistake and Mr Cameron tried to bounce us into war and, thank goodness, the House of Commons has given us pause for thought. Surely that must be a good thing. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, for the first time this year not just Mr Barroso but also President Van Rompuy have come to the Chamber, and yet look around you. What have we got? Five percent turnout amongst Members? They have not missed much. Just the usual drivel about the fight against youth unemployment.  With 62% youth unemployment in Greece, and with Spain not far behind, it is perhaps about time we were honest and admitted we are causing it ourselves. We are doing it through the misconstruction of the euro, through the obsession with global warming and the over-regulated business model. Yet your recipe is more bureaucracy: a youth guarantee scheme, another six billion for the youth employment initiative, the setting-up of the European alliance for apprenticeships, backed up by the quality framework for traineeships, and the list goes on, and on: yet more highly-paid civil servants setting up organisations that will achieve nothing.  Until the euro is broken up, until you reverse the social market model you will not help youth unemployment. However I must concede you have had one great victory. A couple of years ago Mr Barroso said that the European Union was an empire, and your empire has just expanded. Indeed David Cameron appears to be the biggest cheerleader for the EU extending all the way to the Urals. No, you have got Croatia. You have planted your flag on Croatian soil. Not that there was much public support for this: only 22% of Croatians turned out to vote in the European Parliament elections. But there was plenty of support from the Croatian political class.  Oh yes, the Prime Minister who negotiated entry, Mr Sanader, who was jailed for ten years last year for selling national assets, has been backed up by the whole of Croatia. They have sold out their country for personal gain and to be on a bigger stage. A country that fought for 800 years to be independent has given it away after twenty years to these guys in front of us today. Well you may be getting away with it for the moment, but it is not going to last very long. There is a gathering electoral storm. It is coming on the left, in the centre and on the right. You can hardly fail to notice what has happened in big countries like France or Italy, what is happening in Finland, the Netherlands, and even in Britain. The European elections next year present the opportunity for us to show you, Mr Barroso, that the European project is reversible, and it needs to be reversed for the betterment of the peoples of Europe.

 Well there was a referendum in theory. You will notice that less than 50% of people turned out to vote; you will notice that millions of euros from the European institutions were poured for many years into Croatia; and you will notice that there was something called pre-accession aid – we can call it bribery if you like – that was poured into Croatia, and there was a prize.  We, in turn, offered a prize for the first Eurosceptic article that appeared in a Croatian newspaper. In the three years leading up to the referendum we did not have to give away any money. That is the point: it is a one-sided political debate and it is all about the power of Brussels and the greed and vanity of politicians in Member States.  I am paid by the European Parliament and what I am doing – just as the Scottish National Party do, and just as the Irish Nationalists in the 19th century did – is using that money to expose the waste, the fraud and the extent to which our countries are now governed by these Chambers. The sooner I get the opportunity, Sir, to be the turkey that votes for Christmas, I will do so! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, well, there is a great degree of unity here this morning. A common enemy: rich people and successful companies evading tax, which is of course a problem – avoiding tax, which is not illegal but gives this whole Chamber this morning a high moral tone and, as Mr Barroso says, it is all about the perception of fairness. There is the added bonus, of course, that it drives a wedge between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans. But before we declare our virtues, perhaps we ought to look just a little bit closer to home, and I hope that the taxpayers all over Europe listen to this. If we look at the officials that work for the Commission and for Parliament, the highest category are people that earn a net take-home pay of just over GBP 100 000 a year and yet, under EU rules, they pay tax of 12%. It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, and I would say to Mr Barroso: how can that be deemed to be fair? How can people out there struggling – the 16 million unemployed in the eurozone – look at these institutions not only paying people vast sums of money but allowing them tax and, also of course, pension benefits on a scale not seen anywhere else in the world? So I suggest we have a bit less of this high moral tone. And what have these officials given us? Well they were the architects of the euro, which is a complete disaster. Their obsession with global warming, which chimes very strongly here, means we are despoiling our landscapes and seascapes with these disgusting wind turbines and driving up energy prices. But never let it be said that I cannot acknowledge success when I see it, and I am sure the citizens of Europe will all clap and cheer loudly that the grave mortal danger of olive oil in dipping bowls has been removed by the officials. Well done, everybody! (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

I agree with you that tax evasion is a problem and is costing governments money, but we should remember that tax avoidance is legal. The biggest reason that tax havens are allowed to prosper is that we have got this very statist mindset that we must try to get as much tax out of successful individuals as we possibly can. If you do that, and if you have a very complicated tax system, people will do all they can within the law to avoid paying tax. The answer for Western governments is to learn some of the lessons from the 1980s in Britain and America: bring taxes down, simplify taxes, and then those who wish to obey the law have no need to use tax havens.

Madam President, 25 years ago Mrs Thatcher recognised the truth behind the European project. She saw that it was about taking away democracy from nation states and handing that power to largely unaccountable people. Knowing as she did that the euro would not work, she saw that this was a very dangerous design. We in UKIP take that same view, and I have tried over the years in this Parliament to predict what the next moves would be as the euro disaster unfolded. But, even in my most pessimistic speeches, I would never have imagined, Mr Rehn, that you and those in the Troika would resort to the level of common criminals and steal money from people’s bank accounts in order to keep propped up this total failure that is the euro. You even tried to take money away from the small investors, in direct breach of the promise you made back in 2008.  The precedent has been set, and if we look at countries like Spain, where business bankruptcies are up 45 % year on year, we can see what your plan is to deal with the other bail-outs as they come. I must say, the message this sends out to investors is very loud and clear: get your money out of the eurozone before they come for you.  What you have done in Cyprus has actually sounded the death knell of the euro. Nobody in the international community will have confidence in leaving their money there. And how ironic to see the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, say of your actions: ‘I can only compare it to some of the decisions taken by Soviet authorities.’ And then we have a new German proposal that says that actually what we ought to do is confiscate some of the value of people’s properties in the Southern Mediterranean eurozone States. This European Union is the new communism: it is power without limits. It is creating a tide of human misery, and the sooner it is swept away the better.  And what of this place? What of the Parliament? This Parliament has the ability to hold the Commission to account. I have put down a motion of censure debate on the table. I wonder whether any of you have the courage to recognise it and to support it? I very much doubt that. I am minded that there is a new Mrs Thatcher in Europe, and he is called Frits Bolkestein. He has said of this Parliament – remember, he is a former Commissioner – that it is not representative of Dutch or European citizens any more, and is ‘living out a federal fantasy which is no longer sustainable’. How right he is! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the air is thick with denial in this Chamber this morning. There has been a major political event that has happened since we last met and no one has mentioned it: Italy had an election. 55 % of the electorate voted for euro-sceptic political parties. Indeed, Mr Grillo’s movement managed to get 26 %. It is quite tough in European politics these days to tell who the comedians are.  What is absolutely clear is that eurozone membership is completely incompatible with nation state democracy. You can do what you like to take away the powers of national parliaments but people will go on voting, and there is a trend developing right across Europe towards euro-sceptic parties getting and stronger.  There is complete denial about the eurozone crisis. You would think listening to everybody this morning that it is over. Mr Barroso comes out with a technocratic speech that everything is fine and dandy. Mind you, this was far better than the unutterable drivel we had from Olli Rehn yesterday, which sent many Members to sleep. But the EU is not facing up to the consequences of what it has done. Mr Verhofstadt talks about a lost generation in Spain; Mr Daul talks about youngsters struggling to be fed by their families in Greece. All of that is true, but it is being caused by the euro – and that is what the EU is failing to recognise.  The eurozone has been a complete economic disaster. But the real problem that the EU will not face up to though is the state of the French economy and the fact that France is now diverging by the month from Germany. So right at the very heart of the European project and the eurozone project there is a disaster coming down the track. I am afraid that, in the end, the whole thing is going to break up.  I would also point out that you are in denial over Romania and Bulgaria. Those countries are wracked with corruption and organised crime. They should never have been allowed to join the European Union and I want to make it absolutely clear: we in UKIP do not believe it is right and fair to have total open borders from next year for unlimited numbers of people from those countries to come to Britain to work but also, if they want, to claim benefits. As the results in the recent Eastleigh by-election showed, the British electorate are increasingly saying that enough is enough. It is not just us: the Mayor of Duisberg in Germany has now publicly said that the massive influx from Romania and Bulgaria is causing huge social problems. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to face up to it. We should not be in political union with Romania and Bulgaria. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Let me give you
 some figures. They are not ones that I really feel comfortable talking about as they are so shocking. There are 68 000 Romanians living in Britain. Over the course of the last five years in just one police area, the Metropolitan Police, there have been – believe it or not – 27 000 arrests of Romanians. Over 90 % of ATM fraud that takes place in London is now being committed by Romanian criminal gangs, and that is just the Met figures. We have not got the figures from across the rest of the country. Whilst with immigration you can get good people coming from other countries, you can also get bad people. The point I made in my speech is that I am afraid that Romania and Bulgaria are in the grip of organised crime. We do not want those people coming into our country. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, the highlight today of this debate was the Liberal leader, Mr Verhofstadt, comparing the seven-year EU economic plan with the Soviet Union’s five-year economic plan – and it was said without any sense of irony at all, which I thought was delicious.  Well, as the leaders meet tomorrow to discuss this budget, what a curious position David Cameron finds himself in. He made the big speech; he talked about a referendum in the future, and yet he has been criticised at home for making us wait for perhaps up to five years before we can have our say. Most people doubt his Eurosceptic sincerity, indeed he emphasised in that speech how pro-European Union he is, and yet here today he is met with a sort of venomous attack as if he is some terrible wrecker. I would have thought his chances of renegotiating very much look pretty limited, so I feel a bit sorry for him. He is like piggy in the middle, and you all remember from childhood what a frustrating and difficult place that is to be.  But he has made the speech, and we are going to have a proper debate in Britain about EU membership; but it is a debate that is changing. You see, the budget is not our top line issue. We pay in GBP 53 million a day. Whether that goes up to GBP 60 million or not, many of us are saying: why pay in a penny piece? Mr Barroso’s idea that a pound or a euro spent at European level is worth more than a pound or euro spent at national level – well, perhaps he has invented nuclear money, I have no idea. What perhaps we should recognise is that unemployment is actually being caused by Europe’s policies, in particular the mistaken euro project. The debate in Britain has changed and now it is about immigration. People in Britain are shocked at the change in every single city and market town since we opened the doors to eastern Europe in 2004. I have nothing against Bulgarians or Romanians, but it is unacceptable that we should open our doors to them unconditionally from 1 January next year. If Mr Cameron does not get a substantial renegotiation on the free movement of peoples then Britain will leave this Union. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, despite his own views, President Hollande is are doing rather a lot for the eurosceptic debate in France. President Hollande, the decision to reduce the retirement age, to increase the minimum wage and above all, of course, to introduce the ‘hate tax’ to make sure that all of your successful entrepreneurs – and now footballers – flee France, these all mean that the competitiveness gap between France and Germany is getting wider. That is now being reflected in a flight of capital from French banks. And people are beginning to notice that, ultimately, the euro is not just doomed in the Mediterranean, but it is going to be impossible for France and Germany to stay together inside the same economic and monetary union.  So, when your Employment Minister says the country is bankrupt, what do you do? The old trick of launching a foreign military intervention. Your troops go off to Mali; and yes, it is very good to see the smiling faces in Timbuktu for the moment, but you have done this on behalf of the European Union. It is now an EU mission. Just two days ago, Tony Blair said that the European Union is not about peace, but about power. I think what he meant is the European Union increasingly will be about war because the response to Mali, the response to it being an EU mission – and we have heard it all around the the Chamber today, the Liberals urging us to intervene militarily in Syria, support from right and left in this House – is that the EU should intervene militarily.  I have to say this: if you really think that taking on fundamentalist radical Islam in battle is something that we can somehow succeed in, I suspect we will launch ourselves in the same way we have in Afghanistan on a decade of unending, unwinnable misery. I do not want the United Kingdom to be part of a militaristic, warlike European Union, and that is the speech that I have heard both from you, President Hollande, and from most people in this Chamber today. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, we see there is nothing to worry about! Mr Barroso told us last week – I think I can say – that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome. Nothing to see here; move along – crisis over. Mr Draghi and Angela Merkel may well have committed the German taxpayer to unlimited sums of money in order to prop up the eurozone, and certainly ahead of the German elections there is perhaps not much else she could have done – and I do accept that the pressure from the markets, Mr Barroso, has eased for now. And from your perspective, Mr Barroso, and from everybody’s perspective I suppose, the champagne is still flowing, the chauffeur-driven cars are shiny, the salaries and of course the expenses are attractive, so everything is rosy in the EU garden. But I do not think we should be kidding anybody, Mr Barroso, because the fundamentals have not changed. In fact things deteriorated in 2012 – substantially. Unemployment has soared, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, with youth unemployment now up to 58% in two of those countries. Manufacturing, both in the north and south of the eurozone, is eroding with every single month that goes by, and there are the levels of human suffering that we are seeing – with pensions having been cut back, with soup kitchens growing all over the place, and with people in despair – and the prospects for 2013, particularly for the Mediterranean, are that it will be worse still.  And yet what the Commission and you, Mr Barroso, from your ivory tower, are saying is ‘let them eat cake’. You are showing that the European political class are out of touch, uncaring and simply plain wrong. But I am pleased to say that in Britain there is a proper European debate that is starting, driven I suspect by the rise of UKIP in the polls, and Mr Cameron, having postponed it for a few times, will speak this Friday on the issue. He wants to renegotiate the EU’s deal; he wants us to have an à la carte menu. Well, you may give him some concessions and you may not. His real plan is of course to deflect all of this so that there is not a referendum for five years. That or not, actually the longer this debate goes on, the more likely the UK is to leave the European Union. This debate will not stop and I am pleased to say that democracy, the arguments for democracy, are now staging a fight back and I look forward to when the United Kingdom does get that referendum. And I hope that many other countries will follow our lead, including Ireland, in claiming back their rights of democracy and self-government. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, there is a certain sense of irony here this morning because this is of course the week when you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, this great achievement. I thought the award bizarre, particularly as what we are discussing this morning is a new range of measures that will further pile on the agony for those southern euro zone states. Europe is now split from north to south, with increasing violence and enmity between the peoples of the north of Europe and the south of Europe, so I do not think the Peace Prize was really very appropriate. Not, of course, that that will pose you a problem tomorrow, because there are no leaders in those southern European countries who, frankly, have got the courage to stand up to the might of Brussels and challenge the euro zone project. However what you will have at tomorrow’s summit, yet again, is the curious case of Mr Cameron. On the one hand, he is a big ally. He resists having a referendum. He publicly states again and again that he wants Britain to remain a member of the European Union and, surprisingly, he has supported every one of your moves towards a fiscal union and banking union. Mr Verhofstadt indeed called Mr Cameron the greatest federalist outside the euro zone. Yet, on the other hand, he cannot go along with any of this because, politically, the financial transaction tax and the banking union are quite impossible in Britain. But every time there is a summit and the euro zone moves that little bit further forward, it leaves Britain — and Mr Cameron — even more marginalised. In fact it is barely worth him turning up tomorrow.  The great debate in Britain has always been that the single market has been the victory of our membership of the Union, and that we have great influence over that single market. Well, increasingly we are going to be excluded from the key decisions that affect that single market. Given the hostility – and I am sorry to disappoint my Conservative friends here, but there is hostility towards Britain in this place now, where people blame their economic problems on our City of London — frankly, the argument that the single market benefits Britain and that we have any influence over it is now disappearing, and very shortly I think you will be glad to see the back of us.

The story goes – Mr Cameron’s story and Mr Barroso’s story and the story of most people here – that the euro is something that needs to be saved. Therefore, the more money we throw at it, and the more guarantees we put behind, the better it is, because the break up of the euro zone would be a very difficult and perhaps perilous course to go down.  I am afraid that there is a problem with this. Nothing that is being done, whether it is the banking union or the fiscal union, does a single thing to change the problem that there is a massive gap in terms of competitiveness between the German economy and the Mediterranean economies. If we carry on down this route of saving the euro, we will probably finish up with violent revolution in those southern Mediterranean states. So I would say that it would be better, if we were good Europeans, to break up the euro zone and recognise that Greece, Spain and Portugal should never have joined in the first place. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, when I first starting standing up in this place and saying that I thought the euro project was flawed and would end very badly, I was met with a wall of derision in this House, and I must admit it was a very lonely old game. But now there is a growing number of people here who recognise the flaws in the euro project, and out in Europe roughly half the population of the EU and the euro zone now regret going into the currency.  But I was pleased to see this week that an even bigger voice is now being heard amongst the experts in the financial community. The Danish Bank – Saxo Bank – said that the euro zone leaders are behaving like drug addicts and alcoholics. And how right Saxo Bank are, because you keep on taking that same drug that is doing you and the peoples of Europe so much damage. It is time for some recognition. The Mediterranean states do not fit into the euro zone, and if this summit pushes on towards banking and fiscal union, it will not help anybody: it is going to break up in the end. Nigel Farage  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, it is received wisdom here that all the economic problems in the European Union, and in particular the shambles of the euro zone, are all caused by the Anglo-Saxon capital markets and therefore they must be attacked. That is what the financial transaction tax is really all about. And it says two things to me.  Firstly, this unilateral approach on financial transaction tax, on global warming policy, on all of these things, is rendering Europe the low-growth economic disaster zone of the world. This is a self-inflicted wound. These countries that are doing it are damaging their ability to do this business.  Secondly, even though the British Government sensibly are not going along with this, the very fact that this was proposed and that over two thirds of the tax would have been raised from the City of London, tells me we should not be in this club at all. It was put in place to damage financial markets and in particular to damage Britain. It is a bad idea for us and it is a bad idea for you too. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, Prime Minister Cameron heads to Brussels tomorrow – I think, on ‘Mission Impossible’ – but it is a remarkable debate, in that the European Union is talking about taking another trillion euros from European taxpayers, despite the fact that the accounts have not been signed off for 18 years in a row. If this was a company, the directors, in this case the Commission, would all be in prison. But never mind; Mr Cameron will go and he will argue for a freeze, or what he means by a freeze, which is the same over-bloated budget with increases for inflation. And that actually is the very best that he can achieve in these negotiations. I have no doubt that, when he comes home, the UK taxpayer will have an even bigger bill. This will not work because the public mood in Britain is now very clear: what our taxpayers are saying is that enough is enough. No longer do we wish to pay money to Hungarian companies involved in projects that improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs. And our patience has completely snapped at such cultural absurdities as the EUR 400 000 given to the Flying Gorillas dance troupe who, using their own language of ‘rhythm, music and gibberish’ – they would fit in well here, would they not? – give performances such as the brilliant Smelly Foot dance, with an acoustic score that includes some ‘spectacular belching’. No, I am not making it up. I think the British public are angry at the fleets of chauffeur-driven cars, at the extravagant buildings and the never-ending travelling circus that is the European Parliament. We pay GBP 53 million a day to be a member of this organisation for no benefit whatsoever. Mr Cameron, when you come back from this Brussels summit, why do you not accept my challenge and let us have a proper full debate on Britain and whether it is worth staying a member of this Union or not. The last opinion polls over the weekend show that, by a majority of two to one, the British people now want us to leave this Union and not to pay you a penny piece.

– There is a parliamentary tradition of MPs entering assemblies but wishing to use their position in the interests of secession. We saw it with the Irish nationalists in the 19th century. Indeed, Sinn Fein run for elections to the UK Parliament, and the Scottish National Party sit in the UK Parliament. We came here because we felt that the British public were not being told what was happening in Europe and how much it was costing. We have used our position here to try to get that information back to the British public. Given that now, by a majority of two to one, the Brits want to leave this Union, I would say that we are doing a pretty good job. (Applause) Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, what we have seen this morning from the Commission and Parliament is a passionate defence of high salaries, index-linked pensions, chauffeur-driven cars and a lifestyle that none of you would actually enjoy out there in the real competitive world. It is the status quo: convincing itself that it you are doing a good job despite the fact that the public increasingly doubt you. I would remind you that every time taxpayers’ money is thrown at common European projects the results are less than a success. The common fisheries policy and its environmental degradation and now of course the euro are not just an economic but a social disaster which is engulfing the Mediterranean and it is all based on flawed thinking that the State if it has power and money can create wealth. The dead hand of bureaucracy is destroying innovation and destroying jobs in Europe. National democracy and free markets would be a much better model. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President: Mr Van Rompuy, when you first appeared here, in what proved to be a rather expensive speech I said you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy – and sure enough, in your dull and technocratic way, you have gone about your course. But I have to say you are even worse than I thought you were going to be. I thought it was just going to be a federal Europe – a federal Union – but actually it appears, with every statement you make, that what you now want is the total subjugation of states to completely undemocratic structures based in Brussels. I misread the bailouts. I thought that when the bailouts happened and I could see the panic around this Chamber, with people fearing economic meltdown... But you, of course, were calm through it all, because you saw the bailouts as your opportunity to take control. Just think how Ireland today has managed, and Greece, for that matter. The sinister-sounding troika come in, 50 officials spend a few days in the country, investigate the situation and then tell puppet prime ministers what they may or may not do. I note great enthusiasm in this Chamber for Spain to have a bailout: lots of Members here want Spain to accept the bailout, so that they too are subjugated to this new order. Indeed in Italy, the appointee there, Mr Monti, is very keen for his own country to be bailed out because, to quote him, he fears that parliamentary democracy could bring down the European Union. It is pretty clear that your next phase is for those that have not been bailed out and may not need to be bailed out. You now want them to sign budget guarantees and to have the power to strike down national budgets after they have been through parliaments. I have to say I feel that the eurozone is now in a very dark place economically, socially and politically, and I fear that the countries trapped inside it, in that prison, will be there for many years to come. So it is odd that, against this backdrop, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the European Union. It is true that Germany has not invaded France since 1945, but I do not think there is any prospect of that happening – unless what you are all saying is that the Germans are inherently bad people. No, the threat actually came from Russia, and we should be thanking NATO and millions of American soldiers who served on European soil to maintain peace. Yet I do not hear a word of that, because we loathe America and everything that it stands for. No, this is now a divided, split Europe, with neo-Nazi politics on the rise and violent demonstrations in the streets. Frankly, I think that the award of that Nobel Prize devalues that whole organisation. It is not all bad news, because in Britain the opinion polls are clear that a clear, settled majority of Brits now want to leave this Union, leaving David Cameron as piggy in the middle, trying to pretend to be a Eurosceptic when he comes over here, going back home and claiming victories – but he is stuck. I predict one thing: big political change is coming in Britain, because he is losing the support of millions of his own voters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 The EU has a vindictive, neocolonialist trade and aid policy towards the world’s poorest countries. It refuses to trade on fair terms with them, and has a desire to bully them economically. Much of the poverty and insecurity in the world’s poorest countries was created by the EU in the first place. Outside of the EU, the UK could pursue policies that genuinely help. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, I begin today on a happy note remembering that it is 20 years ago this very week since the United Kingdom, having been signed up by the Conservative Government to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, broke out of the ERM. It was a great liberation for us and, of course, once having been bitten we did not join the euro project, thank goodness. Sadly, the same is not true for much of the rest of Europe. I thought, through the last 18 months or so, that the economic logic of why Britain left the ERM would apply, particularly to those Mediterranean countries, and I foresaw that actually those countries would leave the euro zone, probably with Greece leaving this year. But I now have to accept that I have been wrong about that, because I had totally underestimated the complete fanaticism of you, Mr Barroso, your college of Commissioners, and the European Central Bank. You have come out fighting on all fronts. Today you announced that there is going to be a banking union, yet more centralised control, yet more regulation. You make it clear that whilst you think the nation state should continue to exist, it must not have any democratic powers. All democracy is to be vested here under what you call the ‘Community method’ which of course means that your unelected Commission has the sole right to present that legislation, so I do not believe you when you say that and I find the tone of much of what has been said and done over the last few days really very worrying. Mario Draghi, now known by some that believe in the euro as Super Mario, showed us his big bazooka the other day. He upped the stakes and he told us – and to me it is an odd concept – that he had unlimited money. Now, I do not think money grows on trees and I think that money is limited to what the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayers are prepared to put in, but he has made clear his intention: he will fight to the last German taxpayer to keep the Mediterranean countries that should never have joined the euro in there. And now you have of course the Prime Minister of Italy – perhaps we ought to call him Monstrous Mario – who made it clear last week that he feared that nation state democracy could bring down the European Union and therefore we have to by-pass nation state democracy and pass all the powers here. Your henchman Olli Rehn, who is here today, dares to tell countries when they should and should not have general elections. He is urging Spain to accept a full bailout so that they too are trapped in the euro prison. I have to accept that you now have the whip hand over the citizens of Europe and I now think that this euro crisis will go on for a whole miserable decade. In the end, you will have to face the reality that even France and Germany cannot survive together in the same economic and monetary union and certainly with President Hollande reducing retirement ages, upping minimum wages and bringing in a hate tax for the successful, which will see all the entrepreneurs leave France, I am afraid that gap will get bigger. I wonder where the hope comes for those who believe in nation state democracy. We have heard that the German court this morning has decided that the ESM is OK. Maybe the Finns will say they have had enough. Maybe the Germans as a country will say they are no longer going to go on feeling ashamed and guilty for what their grandparents’ generation did and will start to stand up for their own economic interest. I do not know, but I suspect that the best hope we have actually comes from the United Kingdom, where the demand for a referendum is stronger than it has ever been, where our Conservative Prime Minister is in very deep trouble. I think today, Mr Barroso, the British people hearing you calling for the European Union to become a global power, making it absolutely clear that Member States must obey what you tell them, whether they are in the relatively wealthy north or the poorer south, I think those comments, this emerging, creeping, Euro-dictatorship is something that will repulse millions of British people. The only good news I take from today is that you have helped to bring that referendum just a little bit closer. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I think the point about listening is a very good one – a very good one. You should have listened when the French people voted ‘No’ to the European constitution, but you chose to ignore them. You should have listened when the Dutch by a massive majority of two to one said ‘No’ to the constitution, but you did not. You rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty without conceding a single power; you bulldozed it through, and here this morning we hear talk of a new treaty and a new constitution. When little Ireland not once but twice dared to vote ‘No’ in a referendum on European integration, you did not listen, you bullied them to make them vote again. You are the one, Sir, who is not listening. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, Mr Barroso claims to be a good democrat. It is a very twisted form of democracy when he says that all of those political parties that get votes with which you do not agree are not relevant. It is a pretty obscene definition of democracy to decry those of us that believe in national democracy and European cooperation. Mr Barroso calls us populists, extremists, xenophobic and nationalistic. Surely Mr Barroso, the point about democracy is that you engage in debate. You listen to what the other person has to say, you put it to the public and you accept the result. That is what real, genuine parliamentary democracy is about, and you seem to actually despise that and everything that those of us that stand for national democracy believe in. And to tell me that you are in this position because this Parliament voted for you! We were only given the chance to vote for one candidate! Is that your new model of European democracy? (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

blue-card answer. 
–
 I think I had better be slightly careful how I answer the last part of that question. Mr Brok, the British Prime Minister is taken from the floor of the House of Commons and in fact nearly the entire British Government are elected Members of that House of Commons. That is the Government of the United Kingdom. The fundamental difference between that and the European Union is that this College of Commissioners that you see over here – the people who have the sole right to propose legislation with the European system – not one of them has been voted for by anybody in Europe and therefore they cannot be removed. That is why the European system is not just undemocratic, it is anti-democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, under the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament, if you, as the President, wish to enter into a debate, that is fine. You are allowed to do so but you first have to leave the Chair. I would suggest what you just did was to enter into that debate from the Chair, and that is not the way this, or any other Chamber, should be conducted. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, that is the 19th crisis summit that Mr Cameron has been to. As the Rolling Stones might say, the 19th nervous breakdown, and that is reflected I think by the funereal mood in this Chamber this morning. Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off. This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble. There is also a massive crisis of leadership. It is lovely to see you, Mr Van Rompuy. You have not been here for many months; it is delightful to have you back. Last time you were here, you told us we had turned the corner, that the worst of the crisis was over. With every one of your predictions, it goes on getting worse. I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America. You have made yourselves an international laughing stock. You do not have any credibility. But one piece of helpful advice from me: do not this summer go on any billionaires’ yachts on extended holidays, because the markets guarantee we will all be back here in August. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, another one bites the dust. Country No 4, Spain, gets bailed out, and we all of course know that it will not be the last. However, I wondered over the weekend whether perhaps I was missing something, because the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, said that this bailout shows what a success the eurozone has been. I thought, well, having listened to him over the previous couple of weeks telling us there would not be a bailout, I have the feeling, after all his twists and turns, that he is just about the most incompetent leader in the whole of Europe – and that is saying something because there is pretty stiff competition! Indeed, every single prediction of yours, Mr Barroso, has been wrong, and dear old Herman Van Rompuy, well, he has done a runner has he not? The last time he was here, he told us we had turned the corner and that the euro crisis was over; he has not bothered to come back and see us since. I remember being here 10 years ago and listening to the launch of the Lisbon Agenda. We were told that with the euro, by 2010, we would have full employment and, indeed, that Europe would be the competitive and dynamic powerhouse of the world. By any objective criteria, the euro has failed and, in fact, there is a looming impending disaster. This deal makes things worse, not better. EUR 100 billion is being put up for the Spanish banking system and 20% of that money has to come from Italy. Under the deal, the Italians have to lend to the Spanish banks at 3%, but to get that money they have to borrow on the markets at 7%. It is genius, is it not! It really is brilliant. So what we are doing with this package is actually driving countries like Italy towards needing to be bailed out themselves. In addition to that, we have put a further 10% on Spanish national debt and I will tell you – and any banking analyst will tell you – that EUR 100 billion will not solve the Spanish problem; it would need to be more like EUR 400 billion. With Greece teetering on the edge of euro withdrawal, the real elephant in the room is that once Greece leaves, the European Central Bank is bust. It is gone. It has EUR 444 billion worth of exposure to the bailed-out countries and to rectify that there will need to be a cash call on Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy! You could not make it up, could you? It is total and utter failure. This ship – the Euro Titanic – has now hit the iceberg and, sadly, there simply are not enough lifeboats. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we are in the midst of an economic and increasingly humanitarian crisis and yet Commission President Barroso is not here. Indeed, Herman Van Rompuy is not here either, not that it really matters because they are not prepared to listen to any debate or any argument. They are intent on pursuing their political dream of a United States of Europe and are prepared to commit economic suicide for an entire continent. And tomorrow night Mr Van Rompuy has called yet another summit at which he is going to present a strategy for growth and jobs. Elected MEPs, representatives of the people of Europe, from left and right, we have heard it all before. Remember the euro itself was supposed to create growth and jobs and yet it is actively destroying both of those things. The remedy we are being offered is more of the same. I would suggest that the medicine is killing the patient and to increase the dosage is madness. Do not listen to those who will tell you that the only alternative is for Greece to stay in the euro. Everyone is pushing this. David Cameron and all the other leaders are saying that we must keep Greece in the euro; if she leaves, the sky will fall in. It will not. There will be a few difficult weeks and then things will settle down. There will be a boom in tourism. Investment will start to come back into Greece. Innovation will start to come back into Greece as people start making products to beat expensive imports. Indeed, Greece outside the eurozone may well prove to be an inspiration for Spain, for Portugal and for many other countries. We need to recognise that a terrible mistake has been made. We must resolve to put it right. We have got to give people hope because out there now is absolute despair. We all remember Dimitris Christoulas, the 77-year-old former pharmacist who shot himself dead outside the Greek Parliament, but he is just one of a growing humanitarian disaster. There have been huge increases in suicides in Italy and in Greece, particularly by people running small businesses who cannot see a way out of the problem. Children are being left in increasing numbers outside the doors of churches because their parents cannot afford to feed them. Our leaders are too callous to listen and care. You can do something about this. You can rise up and say – and I know from my conversations with you that many of you agree with me – that I am right. We have got to break up the euro. We have got to restore democracy. We have got to restore human dignity. We must ignore Messrs Barroso and Van Rompuy. They have been proved to be wrong. We must provide people with hope.

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, I would say to Mr Papanikolaou that a reintroduced drachma would probably be 50 to 60% lower than its current value in the euro, something like that. Clearly, I am not advocating that we move to a new fixed peg; I am advocating floating currency rates because history shows us that every time we try to fix currency pegs, we get it wrong. The risk, of course, is that the cost of imports would rise, which is why I said that what it would also lead to is innovation in Greece, as people started to make products to undercut the price of foreign imports. But I tell you what it would give: it would give Greece a chance, because stuck inside the euro you are going to be literally destroyed. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, happy Schuman Day, or Europe Day as you now call it, although I thought the celebrations were rather muted. The only bit of real passion we had was Mr Schulz slagging off the English, but that now appears to be a sort of popular sport in this Parliament. When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I am not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore. I think we are celebrating the wrong day. We should not be celebrating 9 May; we should be celebrating 8 May: Victory in Europe Day. We should celebrate the last time the Germans tried to smash the continent and they foundered and at least half the continent got its democracy back. What we are celebrating on 9 May is another attempt, through different means, to smash democracy across Europe. I do not doubt for a minute that Jean Monnet was well intentioned at the start; he thought that if you abolish nation states, you would stop there ever being another war. He did not, at the time, of course, have the benefit of seeing that theory as it played out in Yugoslavia. But, like Communism, this has all gone badly wrong and the EU Titanic has now hit the iceberg. It is a European Union of economic failure, of mass unemployment, of low growth but, worst of all, it is an EU with the economic prism of the euro and this now poses huge dangers to the continent. We face the prospect of mass civil unrest, possibly even revolution, in some countries that are being driven into total and utter desperation. But there is perhaps an opportunity; there is perhaps some good news. Now a democratic rebellion has begun. It began in Finland last year with the True Finns getting nearly 20% of the vote and we are seeing in country after country new political movements on the Right and on the Left making big scores. But that may not be all good news because what we saw in Greece last Sunday was rather reminiscent of the German election of 1932. We saw the status quo Centre collapse and the extremes of Right and Left rise. You know, this project could even cause the rebirth of National Socialism in Europe. We are headed the wrong way. We must break up the eurozone; we must set those Mediterranean countries free; we must try to build a Europe. I want a Europe, but a Europe based on trade, a Europe based on cooperation, a Europe based on us sitting round the table and agreeing sensible rules on crime and the environment. We can do all of those things but we cannot do them if we are asked to rally behind that flag. I owe no allegiance to that flag and nor do most of the people in Europe either. (Applause from the EFD Group) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is a great shame Mr Van Rompuy is not here, because a month ago, he told us that the worst was over and we had reached the turning point; he even told us that he had solved the euro crisis. Today, we have a more realistic Mr Barroso, who says that if we follow his policies and stick together, we can solve this in the end. Sorry, no one believes you anymore, and actually, in the face of the rapidly deteriorating situation, these comments look ridiculous. In Spain, mass unemployment gathers by the day, and internal democracy in Spain is now under threat. In Italy – where we were told Mr Monti would sort it all out – growth figures are falling and the bond spreads are worsening. Now an IMF official has come out and said that it is obvious that at some point a euro break-up will happen. These are big changes: the euro is doomed, and with your policies, Sir – even if Greece accepts the austerity you are imposing on them, and even if, for the next eight years, they obey all this – in 2020, they will still have a debt GDP ratio of 120%, which makes one ask: what is the point? In Spain: if Spain was able to increase ... the difference is, Sir, Britain is not trapped inside the economic prison of the euro. Now take this: if Spain was to increase, if she increased her productivity growth by half a per cent a year (which at the moment looks unlikely), it would take her forty years to close the competitiveness gap with Germany. These countries were sucked in to a totally false economic boom with artificially low interest rates, and they are now paying the price. These policies cannot succeed. Mercifully, outside of this institution, economists the world over now say it is inevitable that the euro will break up; it is just a question of how. I really hope that the IMF now decides to stop pouring good money after bad into these bailouts, and I really do hope that not one penny piece more of British taxpayers’ money goes into propping something up that should be allowed to die.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I see that Mr Van Rompuy is back for another two-and-a-half years, no doubt a reward for his great success. Indeed, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you, I thought perhaps I had got it all wrong. You talked about how positive the last Council meeting had been, that we have reached the turning point, that everything is going swimmingly, and I was beginning to believe it. And then I realised that you did not mention the D word: Default. No, that cannot be talked about. We pretend there has not been a default when we know, in fact, that in Greece last week, there was a very major credit event. Indeed, listening to all of you this morning reminds me of the great British comedy classic Carry On Up the Khyber
, where the colonial English go on having dinner, ignoring the fact that impending disaster is all around them. You are determined but delusional in this attempt to keep the euro propped up. And whilst you are enjoying your dinner, incoming shells are landing all around you: youth unemployment in Greece went through 50% last week. That is fine, carry on, serve the main course. And you will have seen yesterday that 110 German bondholders of Greek bonds are now going to take legal action against the banks and against the Greek Government. But do not worry chaps; carry on; everything is going to be fine. But perhaps the biggest bombshell is the German Finance Minister saying just yesterday that nobody can exclude a third bail-out. Pass the port. Do enjoy the party. It is a farcical situation, and why is it happening? That is what people in Europe want to know. Why is this happening? Is this being done to help Greece? No. It is going to crucify Greece. It is being done to prop up a failing project because you know that once Greece goes, others will go as well. And some of the language is telling. Mr Barroso, when leaders stand up and say that political moves are irreversible, history has one lesson: you are always, always, going to be proved to be wrong. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the Commissioner picked the right man: puppet Papademos is in place and, as Athens caught fire on Sunday night, he rather took my breath away. He said: ‘violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country’. What democratic country? He is not even a democratically elected Prime Minister. He has been appointed by you guys. Greece is not run through democracy now, it is run through a Troika: three foreign officials who fly into Athens airport and tell the Greeks what they can and cannot do. The violence and destruction that you saw on Sunday is being caused directly because people are having their democratic rights taken from them; what else can they do? If I were a Greek citizen, I would have been out there joining those protests on Sunday; I would be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people. In the puppet’s efforts to get the MPs to vote for the bail-out package, he warned them that if they did not do so, there would be a dramatic decline in living standards. Has he looked outside the front door? Has he seen the fact that 50% of the young people are unemployed already? Has he seen the fact that the economy, far from stalling, has contracted for five years in a row, and is now accelerating on a downward debt spiral, a contraction of 7% per annum? Greece is being driven into the ground, and when it comes to chaos, you ain’t seen nothing yet. These policies are driving Greece towards a revolution. They need to be set free. If they do not get the drachma back, you will be responsible for something truly, truly horrible. (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP MEPs abstained on this resolution because, although we agree with some elements, we strongly disagree with others, in particular, the imposition of a financial transaction tax.

on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, first of all I would like to say: congratulations everybody! David Cameron had you worried for a bit, you even thought he was a Eurosceptic, but it is OK. You have had a quiet word with him and the real David Cameron is back. Whatever happened to the veto? No more vetoes any more. Indeed, Mr Cameron is now actively supporting this quite despicable pact, this plan to destroy and humiliate nation states that do not live up to a Germanic view of how economies ought to be run. I must say I thought the weekend’s proposals from the German finance ministry suggesting that a European Commissioner and his staff occupy a big building in Athens and take over the running of the country – a Gauleiter, some might say – must be joke. Even this EU, I thought, could not possibly sink to those depths – but of course it was just a negotiating position and what we now have for Greece is diplomacy at gunpoint. It is the kind of strategy that Palmerston used against Athens back in the 19th century. Nobody can deny today that Greece is no more than a colony. And this is all a terrible, huge mistake. Greece is not a failing subsidiary company where head office needs to come in and take control. Greece is a nation with a soul, a nation with pride, with history – goodness me, they invented democracy in the first place. They are suffering. They have youth unemployment of 50% caused, Mr Van Rompuy, because they are in the euro. You are causing the misery in these countries and you blather on about creating jobs and growth. None of this is actually going to happen. And remember, these people are being driven into humiliation and desperation. Desperate people do desperate things, and I am deeply fearful for what will happen in Greece if we continue with this mad course. And of course, as Mr Barroso knows, it is going to be Portugal next. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Blue-card answer to Reinhard Bütikofer. 
–
 Mr President, I did not use the word ‘Gauleiter’, I said ‘as some might say’, and indeed the biggest selling Sunday newspaper in Britain used that word. If you want to talk about hatred, just look at what this European project is doing. We have German newspapers slagging off the Italians for being cowards, slagging off the Greeks for being lazy and useless, and we have Italian and Greek newspapers depicting leading figures in Germany wearing Nazi uniforms. Surely the whole point is that this project that was designed to bring us all together in peace and harmony is actually ripping us apart and bringing back nationalisms. And if there was one country I really had a go at in my speech, it was actually the United Kingdom because I admitted the way we behaved towards Greece in the 19th century was not acceptable. Nigel Farage,

–
 Mr President, there is a very bad case of denial in this Chamber this morning, a total refusal to accept that the euro project is failing. Greece is on the verge of a default. The bail-out fund is creaking. The credibility of the European Central Bank itself is now being called into question. It is all on the verge of going belly-up, and yet when the credit rating agencies tell the truth you try and pretend it is not happening. In fact Mr Brok and others were suggesting that it is all some dastardly plot by the Americans, the British and the Anglo Saxon markets to bring down the euro. The agencies are nothing more than the canary in the mine. They are telling you the truth, so please listen to Standard and Poor’s when they say that austerity alone will not work. You are driving these countries into depression just to save your euro project. But I must acknowledge that you have lost absolutely nothing when it comes to your powers of deception. No, that is still very much on course. It was Nick Clegg who gave us the clue – a man who, I suspect, is rather more popular here than he is back home these days. Clegg was asked whether there should be a referendum on the forthcoming treaty. He said there was no need for that because it was all going to be ‘folded into’ the existing treaties. I thought, ‘What the dickens is he talking about?’ Well, now I have learnt. Mr Cohn-Bendit made it clear: it is to be the ‘Community method’. It is to be legislation where you know you have a majority in this Parliament and you know, under qualified majority in the Council, you can get everything through. Why are you doing it this way? It is simple, is it not? – it is to avoid referendums. Because you know that if a treaty was put to Ireland and many other countries, the answer would be ‘no’. The peoples of Europe do not want this sado-monetarist package. The peoples of Europe, particularly in the case of the South, need to get out of the euro, to have devaluation and a chance to re-establish themselves again. You are denying them that chance and, by pushing the ‘Community method’, you are destroying democracy in Europe. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President – President Schulz – good morning to you. I know it is my job to congratulate you but, given that we knew this result two-and-a-half years ago, as a result of a stitch-up, there really does not seem to be much point. After all, nobody in modern-day Europe would ever have a big, powerful job that was decided upon by a full, open process. I am sure Mr Barroso would agree. I was musing this morning. I was thinking about what kind of President Schulz we were going to get. Are we going to get a dignified, calm figure who behaves like the Speaker of all great parliaments around the world, somebody who puts himself above politics and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day arguments and is an ambassador, indeed a statesman? Or are we going to get the Martin Schulz we have got to know since 2004 as leader of the Socialist Group? You know the one I mean: snarling, angry, unable to control his temper, intolerant of anybody with an alternative point of view, somebody who is contemptuous when, in free referendums, people have the temerity to vote ‘no’, somebody who is anti-British to his fingertips and does not like free markets? I was wondering which one we would get. Well, your opening speech has settled that question for me. It is pretty clear that we are going to have two-and-a-half years of political fanaticism from the Chair. I have to say that only a third-world country, only a banana republic, would want to have an overtly political President of a parliament, but that is what we have got. Mr Schulz, I may represent the smallest group in this Parliament, but I can tell you that it is a group whose ideas and whose views are now being echoed by a growing number of citizens right across this continent. I am sure you would agree that the opinion polls show that it is about 50-50 whether people think this EU is a good thing or a bad thing. What we represent is not anti-Europeanism. That is not what it is about. We believe in nation-state democracy. We want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of cooperation and we want a Europe that is responsible. We do not want a Europe that seeks to be a global superpower. We do not want a Europe run by Mr Barroso and the Commission, and the so-called Community method. I will do my very best to provide political opposition to your Presidency over the next two-and-a-half years and I hope you give us a fair hearing.

– UKIP supports democracy and human rights. However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers. We do however, feel the accusations of vote rigging in Russia are serious, and would like to see these allegations investigated by a third party. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have often asked myself the question: why would a successful country that has enjoyed a thousand years of independence give up its right of self-government to the unelected nonentities that we see sitting before us this morning? The answer that comes back from the Foreign Office and the great and the good is that we must have influence in Europe. We must have a seat at the top table and we can change things. We have done our best to prove what good Europeans we are. We go on paying you GBP 50 million a day. We have helped the euro bailout fund, even though we did not join the currency, thank goodness. We have given you 80% of the fish stocks that swim in our waters – your fleets can come and take that from us – and we have applied every directive you have given us absolutely to the letter, all of it to gain influence. In fact, Nick Clegg is so deluded he still thinks we can take the lead in Europe. When a British Prime Minister goes to a summit with a very modest proposal to protect a uniquely important British industry, a snarling President Sarkozy tells him where to go, with German approval of course, and we find ourselves without a friend in the room. Some influence! Well you have decided to head off on the Titanic towards economic and democratic disaster, and we are now in a lifeboat outside the Titanic, but we are threatened by a bow wave that is going to come and engulf us if we are not careful – and it is retribution. We have heard the language of retribution this morning. Financial markets legislation is going to be imposed upon Britain and we will have no influence whatsoever over any of it. Something changed though on Friday. Mr Cameron may not know it, but we are now on course: Britain is going to make the great escape. We are going to get out of this Union. We will be the first European country to get our freedom back. I suspect many others will follow, and then what we will have is our democracy back, our liberty back, and we will have influence in the world as you lot head for disaster. It is going to happen.

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, I have to say that that is a very difficult question to answer because there were half of dozen of them thrown in there. David Cameron did what he had to do; he was forced into an impossible position but, you are right, Mr Smyth: he has gained no concessions whatsoever and he has actually now left the United Kingdom even more vulnerable than it was before. We are in a permanent voting minority, we simply have not got a friend in the room, and we have heard this morning that they want to have our rebate, they want financial market legislation. However, he has opened a debate in Britain. The European debate has now started in earnest. Cameron does not know what he has unleashed. I think the momentum for us to have a referendum to divorce ourselves from these failing structures and to replace them with a genuine free trade agreement now has an unstoppable momentum, and that is good for the UK and it is good for Scotland. It will be good for your financial sector based in Edinburgh and will provide many, many jobs for Scottish people. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, I recently visited Croatia; I wanted to find out whether a proper national debate was going on, whether there was a fair campaign. What did I find? Well I found that the EU is doing everything it can to bribe the political class in Croatia. Doing it quite well too. Already the EU has given EUR 320 million to Croatia in what is called pre-accession aid; the EU has just spent a million euros on a blatant propaganda advertising campaign telling Croatia that the EU is their only hope. Cleverly, you have even given jobs to Croatians – highly paid jobs to Croatians in the European Parliament and in the European Commission – just to show them how well off they – the ruling class – will be if they join. And you have got EU flags flying on official buildings all over the country, to give the impression that it is a done deal. You have some willing helpers because the old Communists are still there in Croatia. They still hold all the positions of power and they will all become personally enormously wealthy if Croatia joins the European Union. There is an even more sinister side to this because there is not a free press in Croatia. There is no national debate going on at all. Indeed a prize has been offered – HRK 10 000 – if anybody can find an article in any Croatian newspaper suggesting that joining is not the right thing to do. The whole campaign is bent, corrupt and distorted. We have seen this before from the European Union, but I think it is happening on a scale in Croatia that is worse than I have seen before. This country has for nearly a thousand years sought independence and for 20 years they have had independence. They got out of the failed political experiment that was Yugoslavia. If they vote to join the European Union, they are voting to rejoin a new Yugoslavia, a failing political experiment that will implode. I hope there is, in the last month or two, a debate in Croatia. Sadly, I doubt it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, here we are, on the edge of a financial and social disaster, and in the room today we have the four men who were supposed to be responsible. Yet we have listened to the dullest, most technocratic speeches I have ever heard. You are all in denial. By any objective measure, the euro is a failure. Who is actually responsible? Who is in charge out of you lot? Well of course the answer is none of you, because none of you have been elected. None of you actually have any democratic legitimacy for the roles that you currently hold within this crisis. Into this vacuum, albeit reluctantly, has stepped Angela Merkel. We are now living in a German-dominated Europe – something that the European project was actually supposed to stop, and something that those that went before us actually paid a heavy price in blood to prevent. I do not want to live in a German-dominated Europe and nor do the citizens of Europe, but you guys have played a role. When Mr Papandreou got up and used the word ‘referendum’, you, Mr Rehn, described it as ‘a breach of confidence’, and your friends here got together like a pack of hyenas, rounded on Papandreou, and had him removed and replaced by a puppet government. What an absolutely disgusting spectacle that was. And not satisfied with that, you decided that Berlusconi had to go, so he was removed and replaced by Mr Monti – a former European Commissioner, a fellow architect of this euro disaster, and a man who was not even a member of the Parliament. It is getting like an Agatha Christie novel where we are trying to work out who is going to be the next person who is going to be bumped off. The difference is that we know who the villains are. You should all be held accountable for what you have done. You should all be fired. I have to say, Mr Van Rompuy, that 18 months ago when we first met, I was wrong about you. I said that you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy, but you are not any more. You are rather noisy about it, are you not? You, an unelected man, went to Italy and said that this is not the time for elections but the time for actions. What, in God’s name, gives you the right to say that to the Italian people?

– Mr President, I am always prepared to accept that I might be wrong and I thought the democratic revolution against this euro lunacy was confined to Northern Europe, but now we see that Slovakia has joined it and I must say what a wonderful result that was last night in Slovakia. I am sure many of you here will agree. It has produced, I think, the quote of the crisis. Richard Sulik, who led the rebels said: ‘I would rather be a pariah in Brussels than have to feel ashamed before my children who would be deeper in debt’. Well I know how he feels because I have been somewhat of a pariah here perhaps for the last 10 years, but he has got it right because he summed up the detachment between Brussels and the real people of the European Union. Listening to this debate today, it is almost as if this debate has been going on inside a padded cell that is the European Parliament, as people compete for who can be the most stupid; who can waste the maximum amount of taxpayers’ money. I really do think as a political class you are all wrong, and you are all wrong democratically because nobody has ever given consent for this behaviour. When people vote ‘no’; when the French vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Dutch vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Irish vote ‘no’, you say vote again and get it right. When Slovakia votes ‘no’, we are told today it will all be OK because they can vote again this week until they get the right answer. We have 17 countries trapped inside this economic prison of the eurozone and all you can do, Mr Barroso, is stand up and say: we need more power. People like you – who have been the architect of this failure, the architect of the misery that is being inflicted upon millions – want more power. It is like Barroso in the bunker, unaware of what is happening in the outside world, but planning world domination. In economic terms, it is getting madder and madder. I hear that the new idea is that the bail-out fund will be multiplied, geared up times five, by the European Central Bank so that you have got your two trillion, Mr Verhofstadt. Two trillion – good God! Greece is going bankrupt. If you lot continue, the whole banking system in Europe is going to go bankrupt. The former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, this morning described the attempts to save the euro as the most gigantic Ponzi scheme. I am tempted to think he is right. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, Mr Barroso told us this morning that the European Union is an inspiration. Mr Barroso, whilst you admitted to there being one or two little economic problems, you made it perfectly clear that jobs and growth were to follow, that everything is going well. In fact you painted a vision that a new period of European renewal is upon us. As a former Communist yourself you probably remember the old Soviet leaders getting up to give their speeches and telling everybody that there was a record harvest or that tractor production figures were terribly good, and they of course believed that history was on their side. In fact President Khrushchev got up and said to the West: we will bury you. So much did he believe in his own Union. Now of course we look back at that and we laugh. I think that in our tomorrows people will look back at you and they will say: how on earth did this unelected man get all of this power and how did Europe’s political class sitting in this room decide that the Community method should replace national democracy? I think people will look back in astonishment that we have surrendered democracy. But what you want to do is to say, right, we have a European Union and what we have to do now is have more of it. So, as an architect – and you are one of the key architects of the current failure – you say that even though everything to date has been wrong we are going to do more of the same. I thought that was a definition of madness. I cannot believe that this is a rational response to any situation in which you find yourself and, far from it being a State of the Union, I would argue that the Union is in a state because just look at the confusion. We have got you as President of the European Commission, we have a President of the European Parliament; we have got my old friend Herman van Rompuy who is the permanent President of the European Council; we have got the Poles, they are now presidents temporarily of the European Council; we have got presidents all round this room. Goodness me, even I am a President. I am not sure what the collective noun for presidents is, perhaps an incompetence. I do not know. But certainly when you take away democratic accountability it is clear that nobody really is in charge and it is developing as a Union of intolerance. Anybody who stands up here and dares to give a political view which is different from the received wisdom is written off as mad, insane, violent and fascist; we have heard it for years from these people. The intolerance is so deep that, when we get referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland that reject your view, you as a political class see it as a problem to be overcome. So I am very worried about the whole root of this Union. There is a new nationalism that is sweeping Europe. You want to abolish the nation states, in your case, Mr Schulz, perhaps because you are ashamed of your past. And you now want this flag and a new anthem to replace nation states and you do not care how you get there. If you have to crush national democracy, if you have to oppose popular referendums, you just sweep this aside and say that it is populism. But it is not, it is democracy. What is sweeping northern Europe now, starting off in April with that amazing result in the Finnish general election, is a new democratic revolution. It is not anti-European. It wants a Europe of trade; it wants a Europe of cooperation; it wants a Europe where we can do student exchanges and we can work in each others’ capital cities; it wants those things. But it does not want this European Union model. Frankly, you are all now yesterday’s men. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, this point is often made, namely that a country like Britain is only 62 million people and are we not better off being part of a big European club so that we can have more of a voice on the world stage? Funny that, is it not? Here is Britain, the world’s fifth largest trading nation, which is now prohibited from going into World Trade Organisation talks because all of that is done, on our behalf, by an unelected European Commissioner. Mr Duff, the answer actually is that an independent Britain that trades and cooperates with her European neighbours in an age of globalisation would be able to forge her own trade relationships across the world. It would make sense for a country like ours to start off with the English-speaking world, which shares common law – our own kith and kin in the Commonwealth who we turned our backs on so shamefully. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, your detachment from reality is almost unbelievable. You are behaving like a political ostrich, pretending none of it is happening. You just told us a few moments ago that Greece fundamentally has no problems because it is a member of the eurozone. I mean, that is just deluded. You wrote recently that the euro’s 13-year history is a success story. Well, it is a very odd kind of success, is it not, and actually saying that frankly beggars belief and I think hardly makes you credible. I think it is about time that you and others in this room woke up to the fact that we are inflicting misery on millions of people through unemployment, through poverty, through a loss of democracy, and that it is an error to try and keep countries trapped inside the euro prison. The recent proposal is that Greece should write down her debts by 50% and remain a member of the eurozone. Surely, Mr Juncker, if that happens, the same would happen to Portugal and Ireland too. Do you think it is possible for any Member State of the euro to write down their debts and stay a member of the eurozone? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Very good, Mr Juncker, very good. Interesting. On this very point of credibility, you yourself said back in April that, when things become serious, you have to lie. That is what you said back in April. It seems to me that things are pretty serious and that, frankly, everything you say is a lie. The euro cannot, and should not, be held together under its current construction. It is about time that you admitted – you and all of you in this room – that you have got this wrong and countries like Greece need to be set free. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, there is a new mood in Strasbourg today, and during your speech, Mr Barroso, there was an all pervading sense of gloom. I saw for the first time even your own supporters shaking their heads. They do not believe in what you are saying. The European people do not believe in what you are saying, and I do not really think even you now believe in what you are saying. Because we all know that Greece is going to default. The end game for Greece is near. And you cannot say you were not warned. You were told the Treaties were fatally flawed. You were all told that Greece should never have joined the euro. And when I stood up here five years ago and talked about Greek bond spreads you treated me with such utter derision, it was as if I had been led out of the local lunatic asylum. No, you have been warned all the way through. So now what you have got is economic governance, and everybody here in this front row supports more European economic governance. What is European economic governance? I will tell you what it is: it is a plane landing in Athens airport out of which get an official from the Commission, an official from the European Central Bank and an official from the appalling IMF, and those three people – the troika you call them – go in, they meet the Greek Government and they tell the Greek Government what they may or may not do. You have killed democracy in Greece. You have three part-time overseas dictators that now tell the Greek people what they can and cannot do. It is totally unacceptable. Is it any wonder that Greek people are now burning EU flags and drawing swastikas across them? Frankly, unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and political prison you may well spark a revolution in that country. I suppose there is some good news at least, and that is that in Germany people are waking up; right up to the President people are saying all of this represents the death of democracy. None of this can work, and the German people will simply refuse in the end to pay the bill. Your one achievement is that you have split Europe between north and south. The Greeks now badmouth the Germans; the Germans badmouth the Greeks. I have one last plea, Mr Barroso: will you please help Greece? Help it to get its currency back. Help it to reschedule its debts. Help it out of the mess that you have put it into. Your policies have failed. Stand up, be a man, admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the Member is quite right. London has had some huge social problems, but they are not there today. The difference is that in Greece these protests go on day after day. I put it to you that if you rob people of the most powerful thing they possess in a free society, their ability to vote for and to fire their governments and their ability to be the masters of their own destiny, all they are left with is civil disobedience and violence. So what you are doing in the name of economic governance is something which is incredibly dangerous. Far from this European project being something that will engender peace, it is likely to do the very opposite. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in replying to Mr Tusk, having listened to his words this morning, I have to ask him this. In an age when the gap between ordinary voters and the European political class grows wider by the day, just what planet are you on? Why the pretence that everything is going incredibly well? The EU is mired in deep structural crisis. Greece, Portugal and Ireland cannot survive inside the euro. The Danes have torn up the Schengen agreement, and good for them, because the total free movement of peoples is a completely irresponsible thing to have done. Public opinion is saying that, whilst they want a European cooperation – yes, of course I agree with that – what they do not want is this Europe, run by unelected bureaucrats like Mr Barroso. You say the EU is fantastic in a recent comment. You are supporting the destruction of national democracy. But it is with reference to Greece that I am most concerned about you because, when faced with their recent enslavement, you said: ‘we lived for many years as a non-sovereign country, under Soviet occupation. For us, European integration is not a threat to sovereignty because we experienced not long ago a serious threat to our sovereignty’. So what are you saying? That this is not quite as bad as the USSR? Is that really good enough for your people? And today you describe Greece’s problems as trivial. I am sorry; there are hundreds of thousands of people out there on the streets of Greece fighting to get their democracy back. It beggars belief that you and our President, Mr Buzek, can talk about the Solidarity movement, about Poland getting its democracy back 20 years ago. Yet here you are, surrendering the democracy and sovereignty of Poland to a failed European Union. Yes, sir. We all want a shared European cooperation for the future, but this most definitely is not the model. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Mr Goebbels, post-1945, there were some very sensible ideas put together, namely, the Council of Europe. Let us have a Europe where we sit down together, where we have a free trade agreement and where we agree minimum standards on work and on the environment. We can do all of these things without a European Commission, without a European Parliament and without a European Court of Justice. We have done it in security terms with NATO. Yes, it will mean you will lose your job, Mr Barroso. But, apart from that, why can we not do things as mature democracies? Yes, Mr Schulz, I want you sacked as well – I want you all fired! We can do these things, and that is a positive way forward. By taking away from people their ability to govern themselves and transferring that power to the European Commission, we are headed for a Europe of rebellion and violence. Let us take the democratic route. (Mixed reactions) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– 1. We have previously voted against the following legislation, which removes our right to control our own food labelling. We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 – which prevents us labelling our own products as, for example, ‘Welsh beef’ and ‘Cheddar cheese’, without EU permission. 2. Further, it also gives the Commission unspecified powers to apply delegated acts in the future, thus changing the legislation in a manner which they choose, without reference to the EP members or any voting process in the EP. 3. We also have previously voted against the following legislation, which removes our right to control our own food labelling. We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, which even removes our power to freely designate a product as ‘English’ or ‘Welsh’ or ‘Scottish’: Article 2, section b: “ ‘geographical indication’ means the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country ...”.

 Mr Orbán, you are one of the few European leaders who has a grasp of history, believes in the nation state and champions democracy. I would say Hungary is lucky to have you. You have shown you are not prepared to be bullied by these EU nationalists. When you say that previously Hungary was dictated to by Moscow, and now it is Brussels, and you say that you are going to stand up to it, you actually mean it. So I think you have proved to be the secret weapon of the Eurosceptic movement. Your six-month tenure in this presidency has indeed been historic, because in the last six months the peoples of Europe have finally woken up to what a completely undemocratic and failing project this is. There have been some real highlights in your six months. In particular, one thinks back to the Finnish general election and the stunning success of the True Finns party. Who can blame ordinary taxpaying voters, in Finland or elsewhere, for saying that they do not want to go on bailing out this failed project called the euro? Well, hard on the heels of the Finnish result we had the third catastrophe, the third casualty; Mr Barroso’s own Portugal needed to be bailed out. Then of course we were back to Greece for the second bail-out, with people out rioting on the streets. But perhaps to cap it all, the real highlight of your presidency was that the Danes tore up the Schengen Agreement. So, all in all, I would say that you have had a remarkable, superb six months in office. More has happened to reawaken democracy and the future of the nation state perhaps than ever before. I think there is a growing realisation, both here and elsewhere, that the worm has turned, and we have seen the beginning of the end of this extremely dangerous project. Mr Orbán, jolly well done!

 I voted against the Balzani report on the mandate for the trilogue negotiations from the Budget committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for 2012 by 3.7% for commitments and 4.9% for payments. I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2011 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations.

 These two amendments (10 and 11) were supported to stop a cap or ceiling being introduced for direct payments. The effect of such a cap would be to create an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare as landowners sought to divide up large holdings to avoid the ceiling cutting their money: it represents the very worst sort of bureaucratic perverse incentive for questionable but probably legal behaviour. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is, he says there is no need for one. Mr Barroso, every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say, ‘no no, there is no problem’. Here we are, on the verge of the second Greek bail-out, and you say, ‘there is no alternative’. We must continue down this route. We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next. What a fine mess you have got us into. You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won’t. It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out, which we will be discussing in a just a few months’ time. I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package. They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression. They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy. They are on the streets and there is violence, and frankly this can only get worse. You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy. What good Europeans, really good Europeans, would do, is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency, to allow them to devalue, to let them renegotiate their debts, because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return. Then, and only then, can real austerity packages work. Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts. If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, the United Kingdom went through this exactly twenty years ago. We were part of the exchange rate mechanism. We were trapped, trying to peg ourselves against the Deutschmark with interest rates that were double what they should have been. It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily. Mercifully we crashed out of exchange rate mechanism, interest rates came down and we had a happy time during the 1990s. You cannot fuse together different economies with different rates of growth and with different patterns of trade across the world. We learned our lesson. We did not join the euro, thank God. Those who did are, I am afraid, currently trapped inside an economic prison. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro. Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out, you have come back and said, oh no, they don’t, everything is fine. And now we face the fourth bail-out – the second Greek bail-out – unless, of course, today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either. But the question I want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in Greece or Ireland or Portugal to date. It is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks, and which concerns the integrity of the European Central Bank itself. Month after month, I have warned that you cannot go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt. Mr Barroso, do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Backing up some of my rhetoric, just yesterday, the respected think-tank, Open Europe, came out with some figures on this. It said that a staggering EUR 190 billion of the ECB’s exposure is exposure to the Greek state and Greek banks. Should the ECB see the value of its assets fall by just 4.25%, its entire capital base will be wiped out. Do you accept the findings of Open Europe, or do you go along with Mr Juncker’s assertion a couple of weeks ago that, with the situation in the euro being as serious as it is, you actually have to lie in public? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to say to Commissioner Rehn that I have been looking at the IMF Charter. There is nothing here that will surprise you; it is there to promote balance, growth, exchange rate stability, to lessen disequilibrium and to help countries that are in trouble. The classic method uses is to shore up the finances and organise a competitive devaluation. Nowhere in here does it say that the IMF is there to support political experiments and, in so many ways, that is what Dominique Strauss-Kahn did. He used the IMF to help bail out the failing euro project and, as such, he was a very poor choice of candidate. Now you want to compound that by approving Christine Lagarde – another member of the European political elite, another euro fanatic, somebody else who believes in propping up this euro project – and I would have thought that, as she has got a vested interest, she is, in fact, a highly unsuitable candidate. It is as if the EU has hijacked the IMF, that it is now there as part of the support mechanism for the euro, so that it is not just the taxpayers of the eurozone and the non-eurozone EU members, but the whole world that now has to help prop up the euro as the Greek problem compounds by the day. Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question. I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well. I would have thought this is a very poor choice. The international community at some point will tell you where to get off – perhaps not just quite yet. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, yesterday indeed was Europe Day and in the courtyard here we had armed soldiers, we had the Luftwaffe band and imperial eagles, we had the flag being paraded, being raised, the European anthem; it was the display of militarism and EU nationalism. I thought and hoped it was all just a bad dream, but today we have got you, Mr Barroso. You begin of course by reiterating the fact that the free movement of peoples is the embodiment of the European project. You then go on to say that it is the duty of Member States to share the burdens of migratory flows into Europe. You advocate a common EU immigration policy, but of course you know that you are losing because the row that has blown up between Italy and France shows that when there is a crisis, between the theory of European integration and the practicality of nation state, it is the nation state that wins. So you are worried that you are losing and, in your defence of your position, in your defence of your beloved acquis communautaire, your body of law, you resort to intolerance, you resort to nationalism, you make me realise that what I saw yesterday was actually for real. You attack those who want to control their own border policies. You attack them today as xenophobes. You attack them as extremists, but worst of all, oh worst of all, you attack them three times for being populists. Is that not a dreadful thing? The power of the ballot box. When people dare to vote no in referendums, they are populists; when they want to control their own borders, they are populists. I put it to you that populists are actually democrats and you abuse those who want to fly the flag of populism. Well, here it is, Mr Barroso. Here it is. (Mr Farage, Mr Agnew and Mr Bloom held up small Union Jacks)

– Madam President, under Rule 110 of our Rules of Procedure, the Commission may, at any time, request permission to make a statement on an urgent issue. Overnight, we have had the economically calamitous, but unsurprising, news that another country has bitten the dust and that Portugal is going to have to be bailed out. Can I ask whether you have received any request from the Commission to make a statement on Portugal today? If not, would the Commissioner say why not? Does he think that the bailing-out of Portugal is not important enough for this Parliament to discuss, or is he just burying his head in the sand? Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others. Therefore, UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments, but voted a resounding ‘No’ to the report as a whole. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr Barroso, I am confused. Help me. What is the EU’s policy on Libya? I got a letter on 1 April from the noble Baroness Ashton telling me that the EU had provided more than EUR 75 million in humanitarian assistance and that, although the situation remains uncertain, the EU has offered to assist in fostering dialogue. Yet she wrote this many days after the bombing had begun. That is what she has been saying. On the other hand, we have got hard man Herman Van Rompuy, who has made it clear that regime change is the aim of this Libyan adventure. He also said that the action in Libya could not have happened without the European Union, and that France and Germany could not have taken military action without first getting the support of the European Council. So we have two big chiefs within the European Union directly contradicting each other. Could you please shed some light on the matter, and tell us what is the European Union’s policy on Gaddafi and Libya? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Well there is certainly a broad range of opinions here. I wonder whether Mr Barroso would agree with me that appointing as Head of your new Foreign Office and in charge of external security a woman who has been an extreme left-wing, life-long passivist, the former treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, somebody who has proved to be incompetent in the job, was not in fact one of the better decisions of the European Union. I can only say thank God for Baroness Ashton, without her I suspect all of us would be very much deeper into Libya. Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report threatens with the prejudice a reduction of the budget would have on European solidarity and economic development. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break. Nigel Farage,

– Madam President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso’s view of the world today, but it was perhaps rather more ironic than he had intended. He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere, saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy. I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then, if you do not like what they do, you can get rid of them, turf them out and put somebody else in. It was ironic because his next sentence was ‘and that is why in Europe, facing the euro crisis, we must reinforce the Community method’. For the public watching in on this – which increasingly they do – the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats – people like you, Mr Barroso. I know the European Parliament voted for you, but you were the only candidate that was offered to us. That is not democracy! So Mr Barroso is saying, on the one hand, that democracy is good, but on the other hand, that we cannot have it in Europe. That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt, who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished – well, perhaps his own will be very shortly. He is saying that we want an economic union. Nobody has voted for that. Nobody has been asked whether they want it. He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it. What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal. After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland, it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message – ‘Come in number 3, your time is up’. Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6% on Monday. Mr Barroso knows that himself. It was when yields reached 7% that Ireland had to be bailed out. In April, we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt – another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over. Let us remind ourselves that, in the last six months, 80% of Portugal’s debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank. We cannot go on as a European Union buying our own debt. If we do, the next debt crisis will not be in a country, but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, I am pleased that Mr Schulz has asked me that. The difficulty is that when you form an artificial state that has within it more than one language group – which is clearly the case in Belgium – you may, for a period of time, be able to hold it together, but whether it is Belgium, whether it is Yugoslavia or whether it is the European Union, if you have entirely different languages and cultures, it will not hold together. The reason you are so upset about Belgium, and Mr Van Rompuy got terribly upset about it and Mr Verhofstadt never likes it, is that – is this not the truth, Mr Schulz? – Belgium is a microcosm for the whole European project. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, that is a good question. Mr Schulz, you are quite right that Belgium was a British invention, and a British mistake. We have made many over the years. We have got some things right and some things wrong, just as your country, Germany, has. Germany’s history has not been whiter than white, I think you might agree. You are quite right. Actually, holding together the United Kingdom has been something that has been deeply troubling. Indeed, Ireland went its own way, back in 1921, I think, when independence for Ireland was established. You are right. It is very difficult to hold together different cultures. I do think that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland works, at the moment, because it has consent. If it did not have consent, then there would be popular calls for referenda and those nations would be able to break away. But my point is that in this European Union, nobody is being given that opportunity. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the theory of a Tobin tax has been around for years – the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange – but, of course, it has never seen the light of day. What is being proposed here – and, of course, it is because the European Union is so desperate for money and is in so much trouble that it needs its own resources – is to use an opportunity to bash the financial sector because they are very unpopular at the moment and to introduce a financial transaction tax just in the European Union, as if somehow that will gain us great revenue. I am sorry, but we are living in a global economy. If we become uncompetitive through tax or regulation, people simply move – and they can do so in the space of 24 hours. To do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics. The biggest foreign exchange market in the world – the biggest financial sector in the world – is in London. If I did not know better, I would think perhaps there was a plot afoot here to stop the Anglo-Saxons going on doing all of their business. In 2010, as a result of the AIFM Directive, one in four hedge funds left the City of London. If we continue down this route, Britain will have lost its biggest single industry. I think the time has come when the City of London and Britain’s financial markets are going to rise up against membership of this European Union. Maybe, if we vote for this tomorrow, it will be so bad that it will be really rather a good thing for UKIP and our view that we should not be part of this massive socialist experiment.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service. The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK. We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, what is the most commonly used word in association with the euro? No, it is not ‘failure’ – although it could be. It is ‘stability’, is it not? A decade ago, everybody said that once we had the euro currency, it would bring us stability. Well, a decade on, I would suggest that what it has brought is chaos, discord and misery for millions, and yet the word ‘stability’ is still being used this morning. Mr Barroso used it, Mr Van Rompuy used it: ‘stability’. In fact, we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in Portugal went well last week, whereas the reality is that the European Central Bank was actually using taxpayers’ money to buy their own debt. Your reassurances that all is well do not work. Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Van Rompuy? Bond yields in Portugal rose to nearly 7% yesterday. The public right across the Union no longer supports the currency, and the battle for Spain has not even begun. The model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail-out fund. You even want to increase the scope of the bail-out fund so that, along with the ECB, you, too, can go on buying yet more of your own debt. You are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union. If you succeed, then we should change the name: get rid of ‘European Union’ and call it the ‘Debt Union’. If you do succeed, you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison, in which people’s suffering will be untold, while the northern countries will find themselves paying, forever, a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies. We have reached a point where it actually does not matter what any of you say. Nobody believes you. The public does not support you. I hope and pray the markets break you. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I did say a decade ago that you could not have Greece and Germany put together in the same monetary union and that it would not work. If you go back through history, you find that when people are put together in false currency unions, when governments think they know better than the markets, governments always lose. You ask me what my solution is today. It is absolutely as plain as a pikestaff. Greece, Portugal and Ireland do not fit inside the euro. What we should be doing, what Mr Van Rompuy should be doing in order to give real leadership, is to be introducing a plan B and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency, to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance, because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I welcome Mr Orbán. After the six months’ farce of the Belgian Presidency, it is nice to see an elected Prime Minister from a proper country. How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology – and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union. Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically, you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union. In fact, you are going to meet lots of Communists over the next six months, including the boss of the Commission here, old Barroso who was an advocate of Chairman Mao! You will see centralised economic planning and control and, above all, what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of Europe without their consent. Wake up Mr Orbán. Look at how they are trying to bully you this morning. They are trying to tell you how to run your own country. Tell them where to go. Stand up and fight for democracy once again. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
–
 Mr President, 2010 will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in Europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders. So here we have another summit, another crisis, confidence in the euro ebbing by the week. It is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism. You think that, if you have a fund of say a billion euros, all will be well. Well it will not be well. The failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation. It is nothing to do with the markets, be they currency or bonds, it is because the North and the South in Europe cannot today, or at any point, be put together in a single monetary union. It will not work. And politically, of course, you have to change the treaty. The reason being that the four German professors will win at Karlsruhe and prove that the bail-outs you have put in place already were in fact illegal under the treaties. Well, in many ways I welcome this treaty change because it will mean that there has to be a referendum in Ireland. And you never know, David Cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the United Kingdom. I am sure that, as democrats, you would all welcome a referendum on the EU in the United Kingdom. We should also reflect at the end of 2010 not just on the state of the Union, but on the state of Belgium. For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply. What a farce this is. You have not had a government in your own country since June. Here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation. It truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial. Belgium is a microcosm of the entire European Union. Belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow. Happy Christmas, everybody. David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, the recent WikiLeaks storm has led to mixed feelings, with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy. However, I was particularly amused by the references to you in WikiLeaks, where it mentioned your trip to Russia and the fact that you were ignored and excluded and the Russian view from upon high that you were nothing more than a glorified international civil servant. Mr Barroso, remember: we have discussed this before here. I have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy. Is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage, and why increasingly, the peoples of Europe are holding you and the entire Commission in contempt? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Well, Mr Barroso, I enjoyed that enormously! That you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept I have come across in my entire life. The fact is that the Commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging Europe’s economies in the way that it is. Are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of Europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues? (Interjections from the floor from various Members) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy has been in office for one year, and in that time the whole edifice is beginning to crumble. There is chaos. The money is running out. I should thank Mr Van Rompuy. He should perhaps be the pin-up boy of the Eurosceptic movement. But just look around this Chamber this morning, Mr Van Rompuy. Just look at these faces. Look at the fear. Look at the anger. Poor old Barroso here looks like he has seen a ghost. You know, they are beginning to understand that the game is up and yet, in their desperation to preserve their dream, they want to remove any remaining traces of democracy from the system. It is pretty clear that none of you have learned anything. When you yourself, Mr Van Rompuy, say that the euro has brought us stability, I suppose I could applaud you for having a sense of humour. But is this not really just the bunker mentality? Your fanaticism is out in the open. You talked about the fact that it was a lie to believe that the nation state could exist in the 21st
-century globalised world. Well, that may be true in the case of Belgium – which has not had a government for six months – but for the rest of us, right across every Member State in this Union (and perhaps this is why we see the fear in the faces), people are increasingly saying: ‘We don’t want that flag, we don’t want the anthem, we don’t want this political class, we want the whole thing consigned to the dustbin of history’. We had the Greek tragedy earlier on this year, and now we have the situation in Ireland. I know that the stupidity and greed of Irish politicians has a lot to do with this. They should never have joined the euro. They suffered with low interest rates, a false boom and a massive bust. But look at your response to them. What they are being told, as their government is collapsing, is that it would be inappropriate for them to have a general election. In fact, Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget first before they would be allowed to have a general election. Just who the hell do you people think you are? You are very dangerous people indeed. Your obsession with creating this euro-state means that you are happy to destroy democracy. You appear to be happy for millions of people to be unemployed and to be poor. Untold millions must suffer so that your euro-dream can continue. Well it will not work, because it is Portugal next. With their debt levels of 325% of GDP, they are the next ones on the list. After that, I suspect it will be Spain. The bailout for Spain would be seven times the size of Ireland’s, and at that moment, all the bailout money will have gone. There will not be any more. But it is even more serious than economics, because if you rob people of their identity, if you rob them of their democracy, then all they are left with is nationalism and violence. I can only hope and pray that the euro project is destroyed by the markets before that really happens.David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, I was prevented from speaking earlier. One of the claimed benefits of EU membership is free movement of peoples, and the EU is quick to condemn Switzerland’s democratic referendum results. So why were seven qualified British ski instructors, legally working in France, treated like criminals, thrown into freezing cells and now facing three months in jail when they have every right to work there? Should this Parliament not demand their immediate release, and – I must be careful how I say this – is this ‘piste war’ not totally in breach of EU rules?

 Mr President, I happen to have been at the United Nations and Security Council yesterday, in snowy New York. I support this UN multilateral treaty on controlling conventional arms sales both in general terms and because it has been signed by the UK.  It is vital here to stress the difference between the United Nations, which is intergovernmental – i.e. agreements are made between the governments of 193 individual nations, 154 of which have signed this agreement – and the European Union, which is supra- or trans-national – i.e. it cuts above or across nation states. I do not agree with that approach. Indeed, the official UN brochure I have here says that the UN is not a super-state, nor is it a world government. The states members of the UN remain sovereign and equal and have no intention of delegating this sovereignty to any supra-national entity. The point is that, as long as this report does acknowledge decision-making is done at national state level, then it is an advance. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

I made the decision to vote against this report as I do not agree in principle with a new EU action for the European Capitals of Culture, which it has seized from the Council of Europe. This is the European Union promoting a shared European cultural identity which I see as undermining the identities of Member States. I do not see the European Capitals of Culture as a valid use of time and funding and it will be even more of a detriment if used as a political and ideological tool to foist a non-existent cultural brand on Member States. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Madam President, all of us here value and support human rights, but people are deeply concerned about excessive rights for criminals, murderers and terrorists. The European Court of Human Rights, across the water over here, wants the UK to give the vote to prisoners, and in the EU we have the Fundamental Charter of Human Rights, under Lisbon, and the havoc caused in trade deals as a result of it.   At the same time, the EU is supporting Edward Snowden, who is a traitor in the US. And in this report we have the European instrument for democracy and human rights. It has a budget of over a billion euros and what is it doing? Well, it spent USD 2.6 million in the USA to oppose the death penalty. That is a matter for America, not the EU. The EU must stop trying to run the world when it cannot even get its own accounts signed off. I oppose yet more EU waste. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I voted against this report as it is a gross intervention in national affairs and national sovereignty. There may indeed be rights abuses in Hungary, but it is for the Hungarian people to address these concerns and not the EU. This is how the EU works: it takes a good cause such as this and it makes it its business, but it is not the EU’s business. This idea of a wise men group, an investigative body of MEPs looking into the rights of all 28 Member States – we are not just talking about Hungary in this report – takes away our democratic rights; it does not add to those rights.  I think this proposal crosses the Rubicon and, just as when Julius Caesar crossed that Rubicon, there is no way back. It marks the start of a European empire interfering in nation states’ matters. And as Julius Caesar said, the die is indeed cast. I think this report absolutely says that. We must go against this. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I know that Mr Duff is commendably honest and direct about being an arch-federalist – a true believer in the European superstate. That is something that five million people in the East of England have no desire for at all, and it is noticeable that his party, the Lib Dems, is not supporting a democratic ‘in/out’ referendum vote this Friday in Westminster.  However, this report is outrageous even in federalist terms. It advocates that European political parties should stand in British elections, complete with their own emblems and their own political broadcasts on TV. I believe that the EPP here is already busy raising GBP 5 million to spend on the forthcoming election. The report is in favour of European political parties nominating candidates like Mr Barroso for the post of President of the European Commission. I think this is a false and worthless measure, a sort of GDR-style democracy. The report also advocates extending candidacy to EU citizens … (The President cut off the speaker) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, these proposals have created great concern in my constituency in the east of England. They cover powered two- and three-wheelers, light trailers, tractors and older cars. It does seem to be a case of just trying to harmonise because of a political super-state, rather than because of any real need, value or urgency. If you take motorcycles in particular, EU studies actually find that less than 1% of motorcycle crashes are directly caused by defects, so this proposal really is not needed. Parliament’s own Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have rejected these proposals. I feel that this proposal is completely disproportionate to any problems it claims to solve. It goes against subsidiarity, which should enable national measures for national road safety priorities, and it really does seem to be another case of looking for a solution to a problem that does not exist, and merely increases cost and bureaucracy. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, I welcome the limited reforms passed today. All credit should go to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall for his sterling efforts on this issue, and also to the ECR group. I fear, however, that this is still rather like spraying perfume on a long-dead fish: the bad odour lingers. The common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a disaster. Not only has it failed to secure fish stocks, but it has also failed to help the employment situation in fishing, around the UK and around Europe. The fishing community in the east of England has been devastated by the CFP. And the issue of discards in particular, the fact that good, perfectly edible fish – up to 90% of them in some areas – are dumped back in the sea, is a complete disgrace. Given that Norway and Iceland have not had a policy of discards, and call such a policy criminal, why has it taken the EU so long to follow them? Provisions such as Amendment 119, which I voted against today, seeking to allow discards, are still a disgrace. The problem continues. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, this proposal is the thin end of a giant EU wedge. It is an attempt to introduce harmonised EU taxation and a common tax regime for the EU. It is intended to save the euro zone, but it is a bit like a drowning man pulling others down with him. While it only applies to eleven countries now, it will be expanded. You can see that happening. The City of London, as one of the largest financial centres in the world, will be its aim. Therefore, I vigorously oppose this proposal. The Dutch Finance Minister called it catastrophic, and the Swedish Finance Minister called it a very dangerous thing. This is a disastrous proposal and I voted to veto it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, the people of my country are very concerned at paying yet more money to the EU. We are paying GBP 53 million a day gross, which is GBP 30 million a day net. We are also talking now of GBP 118 billion a year in terms of red tape or regulations, and the accounts have still not been signed off for the EU for 18 years in a row.  This is not good enough – and now the EU wants one-and-a-half billion more this year and yet more for the next seven years. What planet is the EU living on? Is it Mars or Venus or Pluto? This is not real. What is real is that the people of Greece are suffering; the conditions in Greece now are worse than Germany in the 1930s because of the political euro. That is a disgrace, and here we are in Strasbourg – 200 million euros a year to come back and forward between Brussels and Strasbourg. This is a disgrace; we must cut back on the budget. Not a penny more till the EU gets its house in order. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, this resolution is completely unacceptable. It is the equivalent of sending EU tanks across national borders. There is no acceptable EU role in these vital, strategic and offence responsibilities, and no role for Commission legislation. Just look at the language. The EU ‘should be a global political player on the international scene’ it says, ‘to protect its
 interests in the world and to ensure the security of its
 citizens’. All under the roof of a single political authority. It says, the EU has ‘an important role to play as security provider for the Member States’ and it wants mergers of European businesses to contribute to European defence industry. Well, here is the real aim of this shameful BAE/EADS merger proposal. But worst of all, it wants to take the EU to war. It talks of having the ‘full range of possibilities for action on the international scene’, of intervening ‘in all types of crisis, including […] high intensity conflicts’ – and that means war. No, this resolution must be stopped in its tracks. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Madam President, I very much welcome Russia joining the WTO. I think the issue, though, is about whether Russia successfully adopts WTO procedures. What does joining the WTO actually mean in practice? The official commitments include non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, reducing tariffs and binding tariff levels, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights and foregoing the use of local content requirements and other investment measures which limit imports. It also requires them to open government procurement contract opportunities to foreign firms and to accept that the WTO will settle trade dispute procedures. That is quite a long list for Russia to sign up to. It is quite a challenge for Russia. For example, Russia has export duties on no less than 450 types of products at the moment, and duties will be reduced from 19 % to an average of 8 %. Russia is still a tough place to do business. It is ranked 120 in the world ‘ease of doing business’ rankings, and Putin called the accession process to the WTO an ambush of Russian economic interests. So I very much welcome the move towards the WTO, but there are some tough challenges ahead. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have to say that I can scarcely believe these proposals. I feel that they are utter nonsense and it should worry democrats that two-thirds of MEPs supported this motion. I did not. How can we throw money away on such nonsense when the peoples of Europe are hurting? As they are in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in France and in my own country. The EU is clearly hopelessly out of touch with the people it purports to represent. At a time when Angela Merkel today is threatening to veto the entire budget summit if David Cameron vetoes anything but a freeze, this is crazy. David Cameron is trying to do the right thing. Are the peoples of Europe, in between paying higher taxes, in between job cuts and riots, turning to one another to say that what we really need is a Year of European Citizenship? No, absolutely not. Nor am I a citizen of the EU, but a loyal subject of the Queen. The idea is flawed, insulting and an utter waste of money. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against this report as I find the notion of a single European railway area a ridiculous, unnecessary and unwelcome intrusion into domestic affairs. There is no need for Fritz the Tank Engine or for a single EU Fat Controller for our railways. It is true that international, rather than regional, agreements are valuable for air and maritime transport, as are single market measures for rail suppliers. But the United Kingdom is a large island with only one rail connection with continental Europe and it has no road connections at all. So for road and rail, it does not work. I think this proposal does nothing but confuse priorities and drive up costs. In East Anglia, my constituency, hard-pressed rail users do not stand on platforms demanding a single European railway area. They need better services, less crowding and reasonable ticket prices. This is a silly single rail area proposal and it should not be allowed. It should not leave the station. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, the ACTA agreement is one I wish I could champion. I very much agree we need measures to counter piracy and protect intellectual property, which is vital to business, but I cannot support this ACTA. It is not acceptable in its current form. It is too catch-all. Whilst the thrust of the agreement is worthy, the devil is in the detail. In the detail, we find that Internet service providers will be forced to spy on all their customers, Chinese-state style, becoming legally responsible for pirated files. Search engines could be closed for aiding and abetting. In this ACTA, we have what I call ‘pre-crime’, as in the movie Minority Report
, where you can have your PCCs on the mere suspicion of infringement. You have a loose definition of commercial scale, which could see many law-abiding citizens prosecuted for very low-key usage. You have customs officers able to go through your files at airports, and we have this unaccountable ACTA committee which has the power to make changes without referring back to this Parliament or others. In conclusion, I support the aim but I do not support the detail of ACTA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– I have read it in English so I do understand it. I have taken the trouble to go through this and so have my researchers. I think honestly you have to judge it on the legal detail in that agreement. That is what I have made my decision on, not on a lot of e-mails I have received – we have all received those – but on the actual detail and what it says in that agreement. I do not think, unfortunately, that that is acceptable. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted for this as I believe that trade, rather than aid, is a better way to assist less developed countries to prosper. However, I want to make a wider point about tariff reduction and trade agreements relevant to all of us. Here, we see preferential access to the EU single market being given to nations which are not members of the EU but which get reduced – or even zero – tariff walls from the EU customs union. Yet they do not have to sign up to financial contributions to the EU or to a whole body of law, the acquis
, and can trade pretty freely. It goes to show how far we have travelled from the 1970s world of high tariffs and menacing trade walls and how much has been achieved by the WTO and GATT in reducing barriers to trade around the world. We can all benefit from much looser trading relations and lower tariff walls. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report as it is another classic case of the right idea but in the wrong place. Of course we all want to see better human rights records around the world. I personally raised the issue of human rights with President Santos of Colombia last year and I was impressed with his commitment to improve human rights in a country which has suffered from 50 years of guerrilla warfare. But this is to confuse political agreements about political measures with trade agreements, which should be about jobs and market access. Trade agreements are not trade agreements when they become weighed down with non-trade issues. No matter how worthy those issues are, it is not desirable or effective to confuse the two, nor can you switch trade agreements on and off like light switches, as this report suggests, so that every accusation on human rights leads to the suspension of the agreement. That is a recipe for chaos, confusion and misery, for lost jobs and lost opportunities, and we cannot afford that, especially not at this time. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have two questions to ask Baroness Ashton as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Firstly, I do not understand what the EU role is in this United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Here is a very welcome agreement concluded by the intra-governmental United Nations with 193 nation states involved – only Zimbabwe voted against it – so nation states and the UN are at one. Why, then, do we need a supranational trespasser, in the form of the EU, to muscle in on the action? A second related question is what role does the European Defence Agency (EDA) have, given its arms export control policy? At least EDA, again, is international, not supranational. But why did it allegedly take you from 1 December 2009, when you were appointed as Head of the EDA, to January 2012 – two years – to actually visit its premises? It is only 15 minutes from your Brussels office. Is it actually so low priority? David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I am very much in favour of equal work for equal value and of fair treatment, but the issue here is: who enforces that? We do not need the EU to dictate to sovereign nations yet more top-down equalities legislation in yet another power grab. Pay should not be set at the EU level. With the state of the European economies at present, this enforcement really does not help – it is like tying weights to someone who is already drowning. Already the engine of our economies – small businesses – are suffering from too many unnecessary, costly and over-the-top regulations, such as the disgraceful, out-of-control UK employment tribunal system, where 90% of those laws come from the EU and which really acts as licensed blackmail. Thankfully, the UK Government is cutting that back. But business really does not need this – not when one in five young people in the EU are out of work and when the EU share of GDP wealth is falling so alarmingly. We have to ensure that all intervention is constructive; this is not. Then there is the EU’s Equality Directive, which was dressed up as Harriet Harman’s Equality Act. Civitas actually estimated that that directive alone cost GBP 150 million in the service sector and 210 million across SMEs, across the UK. It is too much.

Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Kolarska-Bobińska, no, absolutely not. I do compliment the report. As I said quite clearly, I am in favour of equal pay for equal work. That principle is very important. What I query is whether this should be done at EU level. I do not believe it should be; it should be for nation states. However, I absolutely agree with you on the principle. It is the intervention at EU level, the heavy costs of that and the power of the EU over sovereign states that I object to. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Morin-Chartier, I agree with that. I accept in this report that career breaks actually cause a lot of loss of income and affect this. As I say, I am very much in favour in the thrust of it. What I am saying is that this should be down to nation states to do and should not be enforced – which this legislation associated with a good report does. That is the problem. It is not the report, because that is a very good report in many respects. It is the legislation, done top-down from the EU, which I object to. The great thrust of it is very good, but it should be done through nation states. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the ECR Group. 
– Mr President, I am alarmed at the tendency of the European Union to trespass into areas of national sovereignty where it does not belong; this is another example of that trend. It is the rightful business of the Canadian Government – and not us – to decide who it lets into its country, and why. Canada is not discriminating against us Europeans: it introduced similar restrictions for Mexicans, even though Mexico is in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada has successfully lifted the requirement for temporary visas where conditions are met. It has done so for Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary. There seems to be serious confusion in the Commission’s stance in two regards. Firstly, there is confusion as to whether such visa matters belong in free trade agreements. They do not; just as ‘Mode 4’ worker access is not appropriate in the draft EU/India free trade agreement, so traveller visa matters do not belong in this Canadian free trade agreement. Border issues like this are a matter for Member States. The second point of confusion is about the European Union being a country. Yes, it aspires to be a country, but it is not one yet. So it is not the business of this place to force Canada to treat every EU nation equally, as if we were one country. That is a matter for individual nation states working through their own embassies. The Canadians have laid down fair and reasonable criteria, including low immigration violation rates, low asylum claims, high integrity of travel documents and good cooperation on removals. Those are reasonable terms. If this principle is breached, however, every EU Member State can expect the EU to start dictating all its border matters, and many EU Member States may well dislike losing control of their own borders to EU diktats. France and Spain have suspended Schengen on occasion, as has Spain this month, and the Dutch have tried to block Bulgaria and Romania. So in conclusion, Mr President, this is a line in the sand; a legal and political border that the EU must not cross. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Parvanova, I think the point you are missing is that they are all nation states. The objection I have is to pretending that the EU is one country and saying that we are trying to force equality on Canada as if the EU were one country. By all means let the national embassies argue with the Canadian authorities and do it for themselves, but I do not think the EU should be acting this way, and certainly not within free trade agreements. I am on the Committee on International Trade, and too much leeway is being given to items which are not to do with trade and jobs. Europe desperately needs trade and jobs at this point. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– The answer is that, as part of being a member of the European Union, every member country, such as Britain, has to hand over the negotiation of free trade agreements to the EU. I personally think that Britain should be outside the European Union and negotiate its own free trade agreements, as do Norway and Switzerland – and we would get a better result. That is the reason that is driving it. I am in favour of trade and of helping Europe get better jobs – I think we all are here – but I think there are better ways of doing it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because I do not believe that the EU should be involved in social security matters. I think it is trespassing on international responsibilities, and it seems to be a world away from the trade agreement that the EU is meant to be about. I am particularly concerned about one aspect. I was self-employed myself: I ran a consultancy. This report refers to paying unemployment benefits to the self-employed throughout the EU. This again is undermining our flexible economy. In Britain, when you are self-employed, you do things your own way and it gives people a lot of freedom. I think that is undermining this freedom. This report may be about technical matters but I am totally against it on principle. The EU should keep out of social security, pension and benefit matters. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report, not because I do not believe in human rights – I very much do – but because Conservative MEPs and I all feel that human rights are really about balance and getting the balance right. I have to say that my colleague who wrote this report, Richard Howitt, did not show much balance when he supported the rights of illegal travellers on illegal pitches at Dale Farm, whilst ignoring the rights of those local people who were so badly affected by them. That showed contempt for the rule of law. I am concerned that there is also a lack of balance in this report over things such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Just yesterday, the British Government acted – quite rightly – to arrest Abu Qatada, who is an alleged terrorist and a man who has actually praised the hijackers of 9/11, after eight years. It took eight years to do that because of human rights legislation. This report supports that move towards the EU Convention on Human Rights and EU support for it. So, let us get the balance right. Human rights are good, but if the balance is not correct, it weakens the whole case for them. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, at a time of economic difficulty across the world, and particularly in the eurozone, and with the EU budget itself under enormous pressure, I cannot see the justification for shelling out huge amounts of cash this way. The report talks of up to EUR 6 000 per head per refugee, and a minimum of EUR 4 000. Britain has a noble history of providing shelter to genuine asylum seekers and takes more than its fair share of the load, but these common EU priorities of ‘resettlement’ are unwelcome, unhelpful and unaffordable. That is why I voted against this fund. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because it shows all so clearly that the British people were lied to about the true intention of the European Union project. It is about take-over, not about trade. This Vălean report wants harmonised tax, social security, state benefits, pensions, even divorce laws right across the EU. What is this to do with trade? What is this to do with the common market? It is about harmonising arrangements to create a single European state. Well, I am not an EU citizen and I will not be an EU citizen. I am a loyal subject of Her Majesty The Queen, in her 60th year of rule, and this Vălean report is an insult to that loyalty. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, I voted against Iceland joining the EU because I think, as two-thirds of Icelandic people thought in a poll just last month, that Iceland would be mad to join the EU. Mad because membership would destroy Iceland’s key industry – fishing – through the disastrous common fisheries policy, just as it has destroyed 100 000 jobs in the UK in fishing and nearly all the fishing in my own constituency of the East of England. Mad because they would have to join the disastrous euro as well and abandon the free floating króna, which has brought a boom in exports. Mad, too, because its economy would be weighed down with a barrage of EU red tape. Its growth rate is currently 3.1%, whereas the EU’s GDP forecast is 0 for this year. Why risk it? As for Icesave, there are other legal mechanisms outside the EU, such as the EFTA court, which has already ruled that Iceland must pay up. So we must stop kidding ourselves in the EU that Iceland wants to join. Iceland’s sane option, as I believe Britain’s is too, is to stay proud, independent and self-governing. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against EU stability bonds, or Eurobonds, as they fail to address the central problem: the euro itself. It is clear the euro is a dangerous and failed construct, and no political posturing or economic gesturing gets us away from the basic truth that the euro is disastrous for the world economy. The sooner troubled nations like Greece devalue and default, the better. The cure is now more dangerous and deadly than the malady. Is there no end to these desperate measures to prop up this political currency? The trampling of democracy in Greece, Italy and elsewhere by the EU’s new inner politburo, the Frankfurt Group, so that Europe erupts in flames. Barroso and Van Rompuy going cap in hand to China for rescue funds – and at what price? Gerrymandering Lagarde into the IMF so the IMF is misused as a new euro bailout fund. Weimar-like plans to print EUR 2 trillion to buy rubbish bonds; new wheelbarrows to carry all the notes. For God’s sake, for all our sakes, let the euro go. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report. Whilst I salute what David Cameron did for defending vital national interests over the rules at the recent summit, actually the purpose of it was to put in place a financial plan to save the euro and it failed to do that. In my view, what is much more scary than the full or partial collapse of the euro – damaging as that would be – is the notion of the European Central Bank printing EUR 2 trillion or more with nothing to back the paper they are printing. I think Angela Merkel is right, but she has been isolated on this because she wants to avoid the nightmare scenario, quite rightly, of a return to the Weimar Republic. In my view, it is better for an orderly end to the euro, or parts of the euro, than wheelbarrows full of worthless notes. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). 
 – Mr President, this vote reflects on the similarities and differences between the United States of America and the aspirate United States of Europe, or USE. The US is democratic, free-trading, entrepreneurial and capitalist; the USE is corporatist, protectionist, statist and interventionist. The US are states of a federal country with one prevailing culture and speaking one language; the USE is made up of nation states, very different to just states, and has a multitude of cultures and languages. The US has the dollar, a single currency that is still strong despite a debt of USD 12 trillion. The USE has a single currency on the point of collapse. And when Americans have frequent referenda and elect even insurance commissioners and registers of deeds; the USE puts Soviet-style placemen, little Honeckers at the head of its nation states. This statement may accentuate the similarities, but in truth, the differences are plain to see. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I am deeply unimpressed with this idea of a European Heritage Label ‘to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the EU’. Once again, we seem to have a scary 1984-style rewriting of history, just like the wasteful Museum of European History, where no-one can agree when this history is due to start and where, of course, no-one can mention the war. This is an Orwellian exercise that seeks to term World Wars as mere European civil wars, with the realities obscured in a haze of half-truths. In Brussels last week a French lady insulted my red Remembrance Day poppy as ‘out of date’. I find it disgusting that a symbol of the huge sacrifice that has guaranteed all our freedoms should be treated with such contempt. That poppy commemorates, too, the British soldier who died just last week in Afghanistan. History may be inconvenient and painful but, by God, you get into far more trouble seeking to deny its realities. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I speak as someone with a railway industry background. I worked for Britain’s passenger railways, the Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link, and as a ministerial adviser. Whilst I support the concept of a British-style model of liberalised rail services, which has given the UK the fastest-growing railways in Europe, of track charges, of open access, of train leasing and of a strong and independent rail regulator, I simply do not see this as anything to do with the European Union. Britain has 10 000 miles of rail lines and only one line is connected to Europe. Continental-gauge trains would not even fit on our lines in Britain. They would demolish our bridges and tunnels with their bulk. So I am sorry, but this idea of a single European railway area is a nonsense. It is unnecessary, undesirable and excessive interference in the responsibilities of national governments, so I do not support this report. In short, will the EU please keep off our tracks!

 My hobby is writing film scripts so I declare an interest in this subject. But whilst this report might claim to be about new ‘Cinema Paradiso’s, it is more likely to lead to ‘Cinema Disastroso’. Why does the EU want to discriminate against non-European films? Firstly, this is a form of non-tariff barrier and against WTO rules. Second, filmmaking is incredibly international these days – defining a non-European film is difficult: is Harry Potter or James Bond an American film for its production, finance and distribution, or British by dint of talent, theme, location and studios used? The ‘Fifth Element’ may be directed by Frenchman Luc Besson but Bruce Willis is the star. Even the iconic French film ‘Chocolat’ had substantial US support. Third, you simply cannot force people to watch films they do not want to see. European movies can be winners without giving away seats: ‘Chocolat’ took USD 71 million at the box office, ‘Amélie’ USD 152 million and “The King’s Speech” USD 386 million. Any support for film is better targeted on developing good stories or in skills development, not in seeking to prop up films no one wants to see. That is why on principle I could not vote for this report, whilst being very much in support of the film industry. David Campbell Bannermann  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I am a friend of Israel but I am a critical friend of Israel. I myself worked with the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process and it is illusory to believe in a military solution; it has to be a political solution, and that involves negotiation. Legal settlements do not help that process. I do feel for the Palestinian people who have been very badly treated; I do believe that they need a state living in peace with Israel, side by side. However, I am not sure that this measure – which is a good negotiating tactic – of going straight to the UN to create a state is the right way forward, so I abstained on this vote. However, I do wish that the peace process moves forward. I think that is essential. But only painstaking negotiation, as we saw in the Northern Ireland peace process, can bring a political solution of benefit to everyone. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, many people have no idea how much national legislation emanates from the European Union. In the UK, it is estimated that there are now 100 000 laws, regulations, directives and decisions which come from the EU and have been imposed on the country. It is estimated that this collective legal burden, known as corpus juris
, costs between 4% and 10% of annual wealth in Britain. It is also estimated that the cost of such over-regulation is EUR 600 billion a year across the EU, and GBP 118 billion within the UK. Surely it is time to turn off this legislative sausage machine. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I commend my colleague, Sajjad Karim, on a sensible report that takes us back in the right direction. The emphasis on subsidiarity is correct. 90% of the British economy has nothing to do with trade with the EU, and 80% of that economy is trade within the UK, but we have to apply all of these EU laws – 100 000 of them. On better legislation, the Agency Workers Directive, which will shortly be coming into force, is a disaster for Britain because, in the UK, we have a far more flexible workforce, which is vital to our prosperity and to our recovery. The question is why, when 80% of agency workers are in the UK, the EU should have any role in this legislation at all. The same is true of the dreadful Fund Managers Directive, where again 80% of fund managers are only in the UK. The lesson is this: overregulation destroys jobs, and we need less regulation now. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

– Mr President, I may have changed my seat here to the ECR Group this week, but I have not changed my perspective on the European Union. When it comes to Schengen, it has been the ECR view that this is generally a matter for Schengen area members to decide, including Switzerland, of course, which is in Schengen, but not in the European Union. But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis. Pragmatism dictates that the implications of Bulgaria and Romania joining are profound for those way beyond the Schengen area. A leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the UK can reach Calais without hindrance, for example, and Bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime. In summary, this proposal is simply a border too far. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, Europe Day this week was supposed to be a celebration of European national identity. It is not. It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government, meaning above nation states. This is in contrast to intergovernmental, where nation states freely cooperate, but do not cede powers to a higher central authority. The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference. The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain, France and the United States, whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons. The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation. In contrast, the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron’s proposal for a no-fly zone. It is ironic that the Red Baroness herself, Cathy Ashton, stood against this no-fly proposal, her aide reportedly calling it ‘headline grabbing desperation’. The lesson of this is that principal nations act intergovernmentally while supranational bodies merely fiddle as Libya burns.

– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others.

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

– Mr President, in Britain, the first day of April is called April Fool’s Day and people take great delight in fooling one another. So when some report that Iceland is on course to join the EU next year, I think: ‘April Fool!’ In reality, a survey has shown that 64% of Icelanders want to remain independent, only 24% want to carry on applying for EU membership and, indeed, 60% of Icelandic businesses are against it. It is also said that Iceland wants the security of the euro. April Fool! Even Portugal’s own banks are currently refusing to buy Portuguese bonds. Iceland will neither give up its rich fishing grounds – producing 40% of its exports – to join the disastrous common fisheries policy, nor abandon an Icelandic Parliament that is more than 1 000 years old and the winner of a UNESCO award for democracy. Even with a banking hangover, Iceland, like Britain, remains better off outside. No fooling there! David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, whilst good Libyan people are being bombed and terrorised by Mr Gaddafi, the EU has been shelling out on projects for Libya like ‘enhancing respect for international humanitarian law’. It is pretty obvious that has not worked. Meanwhile, Baroness Ashton here is demanding yet more resources, on top of the almost EUR 3 billion the External Action Service is due to receive. Instead of being immersed further in this bloated, duplicating and insatiable EU foreign service and European Defence Agency, Britain should spend the GBP 48 million a day we pay for EU membership on our own national defence interests. The Libyan crisis has shown the value of having aircraft carriers with fast jets stationed off crisis zones. I appeal to David Cameron to see sense and reprieve both the carrier HMS Ark Royal, and at least a minimum number of Harriers. During the Falklands crisis, Mrs Thatcher successfully reprieved the Ark’s sister ship, HMS Invincible. We must do the same for the Ark Royal. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

 UKIP wants the UK to leave the European Union and retain friendly trading links through a UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, similar to that with non-EU Switzerland and Norway. I voted in favour of this EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement as it can be a model and a template for a future UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, and because it demonstrates that tariff-free and favourable trading access to the EU can be achieved without the UK (or South Korea) being a member of the EU. This is especially true in the case of the UK, which would be the EU’s largest single trading partner. A UK-EU Free Trade Agreement would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the UK as a member of the EU, and would therefore require far less negotiation (e.g. over tariff reductions) than did the agreement with South Korea.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service.

 Madam President, this banana is the stuff of war – an EU-inspired trade war with America that has lasted 16 years and has now been lost spectacularly. The EU has now been fined nearly USD 200 million by the World Trade Organisation and been forced to drop its illegal tariffs – all because of the protectionism that lies at the heart of the EU, in this case protection of French colonies. May I say that this very banana which I bought today in the European Parliament supermarket is illegal! It does not conform to EU rules in terms of the length, the width and the straightness of bananas. What is going on? With such barmy protectionism and such silly rules as this, one has to ask: is the European Union crazy or has it merely gone bananas? David Campbell Bannerman,

 – Madam President, in discussing the Black Sea area, one word leaps to mind, and that is ‘caution’. All must tread carefully here. The Black Sea area is Russia’s backyard. It has its fleet anchored in the Crimea at Sebastopol, close to the bloody battlefields of the Crimean War. We have seen the unfortunate conflict in Georgia, where there was fault on both sides. Had Georgia been in NATO, the consequences could have been disastrous. Whilst I support Georgian independence, it is unwise to goad the Russian bear in its own lair. Then there is Turkey which the EU is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as France will veto an application. Turkey has just 4% of its landmass within Europe. It should not be in the EU. There are real dangers in leading Turkey on. Disappointment could drive Turkey into the hands of Islamic extremists. Finally, underlying all of this is the fact that the Black Sea is the hub for vital Caspian oil and gas. Tread carefully indeed. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, back in 2007, President Sarkozy denied any link between the release of five Bulgarian nurses from Libya and the Libyan order for French missiles worth EUR 240 million. These arms were sold to a country held responsible for the Lockerbie bombing and the supply of terrorist weapons. Yet even Gaddafi’s son suggested that there was a link between the two deals. It was arms for prisoners. In 2004, the EU removed the arms embargo against Libya in exchange for migration controls. That was arms for borders. Now, the London Times reports that Baroness Ashton suddenly wants to drop the EU arms embargo against China, which was imposed because of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, saying it is ‘a major impediment to developing stronger EU-China cooperation’. Actually, I believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro, is it not? Just like the Libyan deal, it seems the EU is so desperate now to save the euro that it is prepared to risk our collective security, as only the Chinese have enough money to rescue the euro. This is arms for bonds. Chinese foreign exchange reserves are USD 2.9 trillion. It has already bought Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds. However, China is also the country that bans the word ‘democracy’ from its search engines and executes thousands every year. So, I ask in all sincerity, just how low will the EU go to save the euro?

 Madam President, whilst we all unite in condemning flagrant human rights abuses in countries such as Iran and China, we must start distinguishing these from the grossly over-the-top EU-inspired human rights industry. The public are now bamboozled by this human rights fest. There is the EU Fundamental Charter of Human Rights in the Treaty of Lisbon; there is a European Court of Human Rights over there, which seeks to give British prisoners the vote – even murderers and paedophiles. There are excessive EU employment rights and American-style rights too for damages, and national legislation such as the UK’s disastrous Human Rights Act, which allows foreign terrorists and criminals to stay in Britain because their rights are now seen to be more important than those of the decent citizens they threaten. The truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough, with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists, criminals and the greedy. This has to stop. David Campbell Bannerman,

 Madam President, thank you for using my full name. I think we should celebrate the fact that NATO’s Lisbon Summit has strengthened protection for our peace and democracy, in direct contrast to the Treaty of Lisbon which is already doing quite the opposite. But NATO is threatened by the savage cuts being imposed on European armed forces. These are deeply dangerous. It is unforgiveable that the UK Government is slashing spending to below the 2% base level every NATO member is meant to honour. It is a false economy too, because defence spending brings good jobs. Today the British Harrier jet is removed from service. This month we lost the carrier HMS Ark Royal prematurely with the loss of 6 000 dedicated personnel. The USA cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us. We should be under no illusion that the Americans could pull out of NATO, as top British General Dannatt has warned, and leave us to an emboldened Russian bear still prepared to launch cyber attacks against Estonia and to systematically probe British sea and air defences, in disturbing echoes of the Cold War.

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, I know Ukraine from visits to Kiev and the Crimea and collect Ukrainian artists such as Tetenko and Shishko. The Ukrainians are a good, generous, warm-hearted people, but politically I would counsel great care. Ukraine is a country divided between a pro-western west and a Russian-facing east. It is also a big player, with 45 million citizens, and Russia sees the country as very much in its backyard. I have toured the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula. The Russians will jealously guard access to the Black Sea from there. Any talk of Ukraine joining NATO would be a sharp kick to the Russian Bear. A clumsy diplomatic approach by Baroness Ashton could exacerbate tensions at a difficult time, whilst the cost of forcing Ukraine into the EU in terms of farming subsidies, regional aid and mass migration would be prohibitive. Better to help in other ways and keep Ukraine as a proud, independent, non-EU nation. Gerard Batten, John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark, Trevor Colman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Considering the illegitimacy, undemocratic structure, corruption and megalomaniac ulterior motivation of the European Union in general and the Commission, in particular, we of the UKIP cannot condone the Commission’s monopolisation of public funds for any purpose whatever and believe, consequently, that any monies it directs to the repair of last year’s flood damage in Ireland will not be properly used and will merely conceal the need for relief funding that is correctly disbursed and directed by democratically elected governments.

 UKIP accepts there are legitimate arguments about the death penalty, both for and against. However, UKIP feels that the decision to have or not have the death penalty is a decision that lies only with the individual nation state, and not the undemocratic EU. UKIP notes the attempts the EU has made to interfere with other countries’ policies in this area. It is not for the EU to bully any country into maintaining abolition or enacting abolition of the death penalty. UKIP also notes the way the EU has shut down any debate on this topic in the European context, despite public opinion on the subject. The maintenance or otherwise of the death penalty is, and should remain, a decision solely made at the nation state level via democratic means. Any state with the death penalty should ensure proper procedures of evidence collection, prisoner interrogation and fair trials.

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. David Campbell Bannerman,

– Mr President, the EU’s interest in the export of arms is clearly part of the increasing militarisation of the EU in the post-Lisbon era. Tony Blair himself told journalists just days ago that he wanted to see the EU develop a ‘military character’. A big part of this will be who the EU gets its weapons from and who it sells those weapons to. There is already talk that equipment produced for the EU army will not be interoperable with American equipment. The crazy notion of the British sharing an aircraft carrier with France would lose Britain access to US stealth technology overnight. It would also close the UK market to American imports and close the US market to British exports, destroying jobs on either side of the Atlantic. Defence exports are worth GBP 7 billion a year to the UK economy, that is the same as we pay to the EU in net contributions every year. We should oppose all such moves. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, there is something much deeper and more significant about the External Action Service, which is rooted in international law about what constitutes a nation state. Under the guiding 1933 Montevideo Convention, which the EU has accepted, there are four separate qualifications for a state: a permanent population, defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into diplomatic relations with other states. The EU already possesses three of these four: a permanent population – the Lisbon Treaty makes us all EU citizens; a defined territory – the EU nations all have clear, defined boundaries; a government – well, UKIP has long argued that this Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the real power, the Commission, are all part of an EU government. That leaves the fourth and final component: the capacity for a nation state to enter into relations with other nation states. I believe that through the Lisbon Treaty, through Baroness Ashton’s role and the External Action Service, the European Union now has all four criteria it needs under international law to declare itself a single nation state – a United States of Europe – and to do so overnight. (Applause from the centre and left)

– Madam President, I do not think any of us can fail to be sympathetic to the people of Kyrgyzstan for the recent suffering they have endured: 2 000 dead in rioting and 400 000 people displaced – mainly from the Uzbek community – placing enormous pressure on Uzbekistan. This is an immense crisis, in the words of the Red Cross. This country is already the poorest and the smallest of the former Soviet republics. It is tragic for a country that aspires so earnestly for parliamentary democracy to be in this kind of state. Indeed, the trigger seemed to have been the constitutional changes that they wished to aspire to. It is also one of the few Muslim nations in the world to be headed up by a woman; let us hope that Iran follows shortly. This lady, Roza Otunbayeva, is the first president of an ex-communist central Asian country – and good for her. All democratic nations should be doing all they can to support an aspiring parliamentary democracy of this sort, but it is swimming in a sea of powerful autocratic neighbours and with the ever-present threat of radical Islam on its borders. This nation is a bulkhead of democracy and deserves our support. I fear it has become a pawn in larger power games. It is now part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which China and Russia use to dominate the Central Asian landmass and whose agenda should be regarded with some suspicion. China and Russia have incentives to destabilise the country to threaten the presence of an American airbase there as well, with covert backing of opposition forces. May I conclude by saying that all democratic nations should support this brave, aspiring but deeply troubled nation. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer Report in the European Parliament because it is a sloppily-drafted dog’s dinner which does not clearly support country of origin labelling for simple foods like meats and eggs. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers selling their goods and for consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We have rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the consumer. The rapporteur herself has stated she is afraid the proposal is moving too fast. UKIP believe MEPs are acting without sufficient information on this matter. David Campbell Bannerman,

– Mr President, I have no doubt that all of us here are in favour of human rights. Indeed, many of these are rooted in the finest traditions of English laws – such as the Magna Carta of 1215, which outlawed arbitrary imprisonment, and the work of the British lawyers who wrote much of the European Convention on Human Rights after the war. But it seems that a worthy agenda of human rights has now been hijacked by greedy lawyers and political opportunists. Over the water from the UK, here in Strasbourg, sits the European Court of Human Rights. Now its Committee of Ministers has ruled that Britain must overturn its ban on allowing prisoners to vote because it violates the human rights of prisoners. But are human rights not meant to protect decent, law-abiding citizens, not terrorists, hijackers, murderers and law-breakers? Is it really any court’s job to ask us, as politicians, to seek votes from the likes of Ian Huntley, the paedophile who murdered two little girls in Soham, in my constituency? Is it justice to seek his approval? Is it right to knock on the cell door of Rose West, a serial killer, securing her support? And what of Abu Qatada, Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe? Who will he be voting for? Possibly the Liberal Democrats, because they support this nonsense! Yet, seriously, these large prison populations could swing marginal votes, especially at the local level. So there should be no equivalence of rights between decent, law-abiding citizens and those of murderers and criminals. They forfeited their right to participate in the political process when they took other people’s lives, other people’s rights and other people’s property. What about the rights of victims? What about human responsibilities rather than just rights? Like the euro, I believe the currency of human rights is rapidly being debased. We need a return to good common sense.

– UKIP do not support cancellation of debt on the basis that it is economically unsound on the following points: 1. A creditor nation is usually a debtor nation. For example, the UK is a significant donor of overseas aid. Yet the UK, and therefore its tax payers, are usually unwilling donors to aid recipients whilst debt mountains pile up for UK plc. 2. Debt cancellation impairs Third World debtor countries from raising further international finance. Therefore, it is not in the debtor nation’s interest. 3. Debt cancellation introduces moral hazard. What of Third World countries which meet debt obligations, of which there are many? 4. Cancellation implicitly condones fraud, corruption and the misappropriation of loans so endemic in African debtor countries. 5. Given the massive debt now of most international economies, who arbitrates where cancellation is appropriate? Further moral hazard. John Bufton  (EFD

– We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean. This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa.

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– We voted against this report in accordance with UKIP principles and on the basis that we support legislation only where it limits the power of the EU or returns it to nation states. Any amendments that we felt unnecessarily harmed British farmers were not supported, as were any amendments that expanded EU control in this sector. UKIP will continue to defend the interests of British farmers against EU interference, as we feel the British agricultural sector is perfectly capable of running its own affairs, and already has high standards of both quality and safety. UKIP opposes the way CAP has historically been used in corrupt ways (e.g. phantom vineyards) or the way it is used to top-up the income of certain politicians in EU countries who own ‘farms’. UKIP also objects to being forced to subsidise farms in other parts of Europe, which compete with our own farmers. UKIP is committed to trade in agricultural produce, under the terms of WTO rules.

 – Mr President, my French is not very good – pardonnez-moi –
 but I do understand that the French word ‘gouvernement
’ means government in English. I thought that was easy to understand. However, it does not seem to be easy for the British Labour Government or for President Van Rompuy. They seem to think it means governance, which is defined as the action or manner of governing. That is just dissembling, since the reality is that the EU Council’s agreement to improve economic EU gouvernement
 means the action of ruling and directing the affairs of a state. The truth, then, is that the Council has handed yet more powers over to the EU, including powers over the UK economy, which is the single most important issue to the British people today. When will people be told the truth? We are heading for an EU superstate, and Britain will have to pay to rescue those in the euro area – even though it is not, thankfully, a member of the euro itself.

It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability. If there were not open borders within the EU, and each country had its own immigration policy, serious organised crime and people-trafficking would be much easier to stamp out.

– UKIP is gravely concerned with the situation in Iran and calls for governments on both sides to come to a diplomatic, but above all, peaceful solution to the ongoing political and humanitarian breakdown in the country. The EU must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate the tense situation. Unaccountable EU bureaucrats, instead of elected politicians leading the negotiations, will end up with a bad outcome for Iran and the rest of the world. Negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments, not forced upon from above by the EU. There are many countries wanting to stay neutral, such as Ireland, and the EU representing those countries on this issue seriously undermines their democratically-backed policy.

Of course, we encourage government and individuals to give relief and money to help those affected and rebuild the country. However, this must be done transparently with the public and not by secretive, unelected bureaucrats with international ambitions of grandeur. David Campbell Bannerman,

– Mr President, Amendment 1 of this housing resolution proposes to extend use of the European Regional Development Fund to all Member States, not just those joining in 2004. So this is directly relevant to Britain. It is clear from the resolution that the Roma population is the largest marginalised community in the report receiving support, plus others of similar socio-economic condition. The overall budget for the European cohesion policy is a staggering EUR 347 billion over seven years – larger than many economies, even. My constituents in East Anglia are already deeply concerned at the scale of the traveller and gypsy communities, particularly so in Essex. They will be angry should any of these measures facilitate yet more EU mass immigration. Britain has already seen a rise in population of three and a half million – half the size of London – in the 12 years since the Labour Government came to power in 1997. Given, too, that nearly nine out of ten new British homes – 86% – will be due to immigration over the next 30 years, proposals like these seem to be yet another bridgehead for major immigration into Britain. We do not have the room. It is about space, not race. Controlled immigration through permits and visas is a good thing, but uncontrolled immigration is a bad thing, for that is the fast route to extremism, which none of us desire. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, in my English constituency this week, it was discovered that scientists from the University of East Anglia were allegedly manipulating data to try and prove man-made global warming. What a giveaway that was! It is clear now that the scientific consensus on man-made global warming is fast eroding: 30 000 sceptical scientists in the Manhattan Declaration; 600 scientists in a US Senate report; even German scientists this year writing to Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, the author of the key UN report on this, Sir Nicholas Stern, urges us to become vegetarian to stop cows farting. Maybe it is not just certain cows that have gone mad. I am on the Committee on International Trade. I am deeply concerned with the WTO talks starting this week. I worry about a drift towards green tariffs justified on the basis of such spurious claims. These new tariffs are just barriers to trade, they punish the poor and have no justification whatsoever. This is just enviro-imperialism. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate. The wicked Lisbon constitution already forces an unelected President and Foreign Minister on us all. Now this report adds a new European diplomatic service, the so-called European External Action Service, but embassies represent national interests. So what national interests will these new EU diplomats and embassies represent? They will not be those of our nation states, our trade or our companies. They will be those of the European Commission. All other national embassies will become redundant. Already, British embassies around the world are selling off properties. This master plan for an EU superstate is built on foundations of deceit, dishonesty and denial, but federalists are not creating a new United States of America. They are creating a new Yugoslavia. By forcing very different nations, cultures and economies together under a rigid, undemocratic Soviet-style bureaucracy, you are entering very dangerous waters indeed. I worked for the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process. I saw what happened when democracy fails. It is not pretty. Now I see democracy failing here in Europe. You profess to love peace but, by railroading through Lisbon and by this power grab of our embassies, you are putting Europe firmly back on the road towards war once again.

− We acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, particularly for beef and sheep farmers in the South and East of England who, by wholesale vaccination on their own farms, have created a firewall against bluetongue that their fellow farmers in the North and West have benefited from. In order to vote for EU funding for this vaccine we are obliged (in the same vote) to vote for increased funding for Eurojust and Europol. These are two agencies that operate outside the boundaries acceptable to British law, severely increasing the power of the state at the expense of the liberty of the individual. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, we could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains our voting abstention on the subject. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this is my first, or maiden, speech in this Parliament. As a UKIP MEP for the East of England, you will expect me to be a rebel and I will try not to disappoint you or my voters. We are discussing today EU trade agreements and, in particular, that with South Korea, due to be signed this year. As we do not have much of the detail on this particular agreement, other than the fact, I believe, that two thirds of the benefits will accrue to South Korea and one third to the EU, I would like to make some more general points. Many people are not aware that there are over a hundred separate bilateral EU trade agreements like this one; 116 is one estimate. There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa. In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein. There are also trade agreements with non-EU EEA and EFTA countries such as Switzerland and Norway. Norway’s trade agreement religiously protects both its fishing and farming, and Norway is not a minnow. It is the EU’s fourth largest import partner and sixth largest export market. What should a trade agreement like South Korea’s really contain, then? Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example. There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products. There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland. There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area. The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU’s film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants. There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters. In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost. It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access, but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion, a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year. Nor is Switzerland an insignificant trading partner either: 80% of Swiss exports go to the EU, and it is the EU’s fourth largest trading partner. My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources. Even the Commission website admits ‘Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings. It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.’ How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers’ Directive or the new Fund Managers’ Directive! So I conclude in asking, why not Britain? Why cannot Britain have a similar, friendly trade agreement with the EU like South Korea instead of full EU membership? Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year. We, too, can have the kind of assurances the Swiss enjoy. We could, and I believe we should, be an independent free trading nation once again such as Norway, Switzerland and even South Korea. John Bufton  (EFD

This summit sees us discuss, once again, the EU’s Youth Employment Initiative, its place within wider efforts to foster growth, jobs and EU competitiveness, and the aim of making it fully operational by January 2014. The UK currently has a youth unemployment rate of 21 %. This means that approximately 1 million 18-25 year olds in the country are out of work. And, as of 1 January 2014, when 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians will be allowed to enter the country freely, the youth job market – and, more than likely, the job market as a whole – is sure to reach saturation point. We can sit here and discuss and dissect the Youth Employment Initiative all day and all night but my party and I quite simply cannot see how this initiative will make any real positive impact in our country. It is clear to me that the only way to ease the youth employment crisis we are currently facing in the UK is to leave the EU, regain proper control of our borders and make sure that any available jobs are done by our own young people.

Against. My Party voted to send this report back to committee as we do not believe that Europe should be allowed to interfere in the sensitive issues it discusses. According to the EU treaties, abortion is a matter of sovereign competence for the Member States, yet this report attempts to interfere with and override that fact. Furthermore, it is a fundamental part of human rights that parents should have the freedom to bring up their children according to their own choices and moral beliefs – enforcing compulsory sex education across the EU, as outlined in this report, is contrary to this right. In short, the Estrela report is a mix of illegal, counterproductive, curious and shameful propositions not worthy of our support. John Bufton  (EFD

Firstly, it is important to emphasise that the UK is not part of this scheme. Moreover, we are against this directive as it supports a proposal, in the area of gathering and exchanging information on border security, which will give the Commission further power over immigration control.

I voted against this proposal as my party believes that the existing Batteries Directive prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated in devices or products, which contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight, with exceptions for certain categories of products.

I am not in favour of the creation or expansion of unified criminal law and criminal proceedings across the European Union.

This is an important issue, which should be covered by national legislation rather than by the EU. Ideally it should be possible to introduce and support practical anti-discriminatory measures.

This is another example of how citizens are fed up and disappointed with the EU: often, complainants resort to these petitions simply because it is seen as a way to protest. The Committee on Petitions has no real power to change anything and yet it continues to ask for more petitions – just in order to create more unnecessary legislation. Individuals with genuine complaints should be able to have those complaints resolved at domestic level through sovereign parliaments. John Bufton  (EFD

I voted against this because the agreement concerns steps and processes for establishing the European Banking Union, which my party opposes. This directive calls for regular exchanges of views with the relevant parliamentary committee, oral discussions behind closed doors with the bureau of the same committee and, ultimately, better access to information, including the non-confidential parts of the minutes of the Supervisory Board. In my view such measures are very harmful to the interests of British companies. John Bufton  (EFD

I am against this directive because the UK already faces a number of immigration and healthcare challenges which would only increase if the directive were to be adopted. On the one hand, introducing a virtual professional qualifications card that would make it easier for European healthcare professionals to move and practice in other EU countries would cause a brain drain in some European countries that are in dire need of qualified healthcare professionals. On the other hand, it would increase the difficulties in already challenged labour markets in countries such as the UK, which are struggling to support local workers while dealing with an influx of legal and illegal immigration.

I prefer not to give our consent to such agreements, particularly as we have our own immigration policies in the UK and do not want EU involvement in such legislative concerns. The question of readmission of illegal immigrants from Armenia, and those who are no longer in possession of a valid permit to work and/or live in the EU, should be dealt with through a bilateral agreement with Armenia, which I believe will be far more efficient.

I believe that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade block in order to sign trade agreements. Iceland, for instance, has now suspended its application for EU membership which in our view is a wise decision.

This is the reason we abstained on this directive. John Bufton  (EFD

A sovereign nation does not need to be a part of a large trade block in order to sign trade agreements, which is why I abstained from voting for EU-Taiwan trade relations.

My party has made it very clear from the outset that we oppose all aspects of this Directive. No-one can dispute that smoking is a major health issue that affects the whole of Europe. Indeed we have all seen the statistics – that over 700 000 people a year in Europe die of smoking. However shocking this figure is, though, it is ultimately these people’s right to smoke – and the EU certainly does not have the right to try and stop them. Ironically, the measures outlined in the Directive are flawed on so many levels that they are unlikely to stop people smoking anyway. Banning smalls packs will simply make people buy more cigarettes. Banning menthol and other flavoured cigarettes will simply increase the cigarette black market. Demanding that large health warnings be put on cigarette packs will make counterfeiting easier, fuelling the black market yet further. Once again, the EU has failed to see the wood for the trees here and, as a result, this Directive is not only misinformed and unfounded but entirely unfit for purpose. John Bufton  (EFD

Against. I voted against the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement on a Civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) between the European Community and its Member States and Ukraine for two reasons: firstly, because I believe that the British Government alone should have the right to conclude international agreements which affect the UK and secondly, because in my opinion the GNSS is a huge waste of money which is not proving to be operational and to the benefit of UK citizens.

I must laud the Commission Presidentʼs attempt to put a positive spin on the current State of the Union, however, I quite simply fail to buy into his over optimistic and ideological view. And I am sure I am not the only one. Europe is, in reality, nowhere near an economic recovery – fragile or otherwise. And this incessant pursuit of forming a Europe-wide banking union is unlikely to aid recovery. It is, if anything, more likely to lead Europe into an even deeper financial mess. Similarly, his suggestion that we continue to work in the same way to alleviate unemployment levels in the EU is simply absurd. One look at the figures tells us that the schemes and systems implemented to date have been ineffective – and yet he insists on forcing the Member States to continue down this road to ruin. To end on a positive note, although it is unusual for the Commission President to express opinions about the internal political situation in a Member State, I welcome his acknowledgement that UKIP is fast becoming a real fighting force in UK politics. The real brand of euro-scepticism that our party offers is finally receiving the recognition it deserves. John Bufton  (EFD

 I voted against the discharge of the Railway Agency in particular because of the wastefulness of its two headquarters in Lille and Valenciennes, two cities that are 50 kilometres apart.

 Mr President, when I was European Commission Chief Accountant back in 2002, I pointed out huge flaws in the accounting systems. Today it is still just as bad – or even worse – than it was back then. Yet MEPs will grant discharge to the budget, despite a hole of EUR[nbsp ]6.2 billion in the accounts. It is now clear to me that the discharge procedure is a pantomime. There is no longer proper scrutiny or any holding to account for taxpayers’ money by MEPs. What an anomaly! Those who approve the budget are the same voices asking for budget increases, year after year, for the same Member States they blame for the irregularities. We should instead be cutting the EU budget by a minimum of the same level of the error. In May, taxpayers should call to account all the MEPs who approve of this ludicrous situation. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 Madam President, it is that time of the year again when we put forward our wishes regarding what the EU budget should be spent on. Headlines like ‘investing in research and innovation’, ‘strengthening EU industry’ or ‘job creation’ are repeated year after year. We are supposed to have been investing in those areas for the last decade. It has made no difference, as the crisis has demonstrated, and yet the Commission keeps asking for more money. This is in spite of the fact that the auditors say that the level of irregularities has increased. As I see it, the Commission has totally failed to demonstrate any efficiency in controlling taxpayers’ money. Would anybody in their right mind invest in such a badly-run organisation? The answer would certainly be no. So why do we keep asking for more money from taxpayers? It is this Parliament’s role to call the Commission to account and say ‘no’ to business as usual.

 I voted against the Gardiazabal Rubial report on the General guidelines for the 2015 budget – Section III. The guidelines as always seek to increase the EU budget and turn a blind eye to the continuing high level of irregularities in the budget. In 2012 these were 4.8% of the budget. In addition the Court of Auditors has not approved the EU books for the nineteenth consecutive year. The EU budget exists to make the EU relevant to the citizens of Member States but in the light of the EU’s continuing role in the financial crisis, even it is not enough to make the citizens want to continue with the project.

 I voted against the Costello Report on the Fund for European aid to the most deprived. Our government strongly supports measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion. But it does not believe that the Fund for European aid to the most deprived will be an effective way of doing this. We were one of a number of Member States which argued that this was an area of national competence and we have not participated in the previous food-bank schemes since the mid-1990s.

 I voted against the De Backer Report on the European Semester. While the report is in the main part acceptable and supports Conservative priorities such as structural reforms, tax simplification and a stronger single market in services, there are too many concessions made to the Left.

 I voted against this report because it fails in its stated aims. Decreasing the length of delay after which compensation can be claimed from five to three hours would incentivise airlines to cancel flights in order to maintain their schedule and minimise compensation. Secondly, it would put a disproportionate burden on feeder flights. If adopted, these proposals would lead to a reduction in services (particularly from the regions) and would threaten ‘inter-lining’, thus increasing journey times and requiring passengers to check baggage in and out for ‘connecting flights’. In addition, the proposals would not remove a clause suspending the application of air-passenger-rights legislation to Gibraltar. In 2006, the UK, Spain and the Government of Gibraltar concluded the ‘Cordoba Agreement’ to ensure that Gibraltar Airport was part of the EU’s single market. I share the UK Government’s strong view that Gibraltar is an EU airport and that, in line with the Treaties, all EU aviation measures must be extended to Gibraltar. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I cannot support this joint committee report calling for the continuation of the 2020 binding targets on emissions reduction and renewables, as well as a mandatory target for energy efficiency.

 I voted for the oral question on female genital mutilation (FGM), asking the Commission about its intentions to propose a strategy and action plan aimed at addressing FGM. Although I do not want to see an EU legislative instrument, I would like to see more coherent policy, detailing how Member States can tackle this brutality. In particular, I would like to see Member States pursuing, prosecuting and punishing any EU resident who has carried out FGM, and I would like to see them recognise that FGM is a gross form of violence against women and violence against the child.

Presently most Member States require documents to be authenticated, either through legalisation or apostille procedures, where documents have been issued in another country, including other Member States.

 This directive updates the 2003 Market Abuse Directive by introducing maximum jail sentences of at least four years for market abuse, such as insider dealing, market manipulation and unlawful disclosure of information. It complements the regulation adopted last year which imposed large fines on companies involved in such practices. It should be noted that while the UK already imposes more severe criminal sanctions than required by the proposal, it has an opt-out on this legislation under Protocol 21. Nevertheless, as many Member States have hitherto imposed less severe penalties in this area, I voted in favour of the report to reduce the number of cases of market abusers taking advantage of lax jurisdictions.

 This regulation has been resubmitted to Parliament due to an incorrect legal basis being used in the original proposal. A notification mechanism will be put in place for Member States to provide the Commission with certain data and information regarding investment projects in energy infrastructure that concern the production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas and electricity. I voted in favour of this report as it will help to build a better understanding of the EU’s energy infrastructure, which will be particularly important when reviewing and planning energy security policies.

 Part of this report is dedicated to the procedure on the appointment of the Court of Auditors’ members and consultation with Parliament. It is stressed that some appointments to the Court have given rise to differences between Parliament and the Council, and it is considered unacceptable that the Council appoints members to the Court of Auditors despite Parliament’s unfavourable opinion. Here, I support the current application of Article 286 TFEU, whereby the Council has the right to adopt candidates for the Court of Auditors after consulting the European Parliament. I defend the Council’s right to override a negative opinion by the European Parliament. Consequently I voted against this report. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I am concerned that this report goes way beyond the competence of REGI and deals with questions that ought to fall within the sole competence of ITRE. Moreover, as Parliament has already adopted reports on the role of cohesion policy in implementing EU energy policy and on the implementation of energy efficiency measures under cohesion policy, this report is unnecessary and unhelpful. Beyond this question of competence, the report calls for ambitious strategies and policies for dealing with CO2
 emissions – in particular, the call for further ambitious binding energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. I am firmly opposed to the setting of any such ambitious targets which prioritise renewable energies over other low-carbon alternatives. Moreover, I am strongly opposed to the earmarking of 20 % of ERDF funding in the recent 2014-2020 Common Provisions Regulation for strategies to develop a low-carbon economy. The report is overwhelmingly prescriptive concerning this point. It is for these reasons that I voted against it. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Caspary Report on access of third-country goods and services to the Unionʼs internal market in public procurement and procedures supporting negotiations on access of Union goods and services to the public procurement markets of third countries. My vote was against the proposed regulation because it could lead to a net reduction in market access and could diminish growth potential at a time when it is needed most. This is the position of a majority of the Member States in the Council. There are significant risks in deploying the proposed instrument as a leveraging tool in trade negotiations as it could leave the EU open to damaging retaliatory measures, losing out on growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets.

I voted for the Macovei Report on the Hercule III programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the European Unionʼs financial interests because the new programme continues to place specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, which are estimated to cost Member States EUR 11 billion per annum. The programme reflects the Commissionʼs legal obligations stemming from agreements with four international tobacco manufacturers. Even though questions do remain regarding the effectiveness of such programmes, in this case efforts must be made to manage the administrative costs of the programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, there is no doubt that smuggling and the counterfeiting of cigarettes are matters of serious concern for us all. The large sums of money lost, which should be going to exchequers across the EU, are significant, and this means that front-line services are not being as well supported as they should be. But let us be honest: the amounts of taxpayers’ money wasted by the EU institutions are also significant. Some 4.8 % of the EU budget in 2012 was spent on regional projects which should never have received the money – a total of EUR 5.5 billion. Only in December did we learn that billions in aid to Gaza and Egypt cannot be properly accounted for, having been spent on out-of-work politicians. And almost every month we receive a new Court of Auditors’ report spelling out more errors and more wasted money. If MEPs are serious about looking after EU financial interests, they should look closer to home as well as to the Hercule III programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

Mr President, this report represents a broken promise. The Commission assured us that they would get errors under control. Instead, they are on the rise again: up from 3.9% in 2011 to 4.8% in 2012. That is over EUR 6 billion of taxpayers’ money that cannot be properly accounted for. Like the vast majority of the public I am disgusted that the Commission is paying lip service to getting their finances in order. However, what really bothers my patience in this House is the ‘business as usual’ mentality, where irregularities are tolerated despite the huge amounts of money involved. The Commission just gets a polite slap on the wrist. In any private enterprise, if almost 5% of the budget was in error, heads would roll and the shareholders would quite rightly demand change at the top. Instead, this Parliament, which blames the Member States for irregularities, is happy to ask for a bigger EU budget, to give to those same Member States. What a contradiction! Marta Andreasen  (ECR

The report of the Court of Auditors for 2012 has the level of ‘irregularities’ up to 4.8%. No responsible person can vote for this.

 Mr President, during my time as an MEP, this House has come every year, without exception, with a request to increase the EU budget and this, regardless of the current crisis and the austerity measures. Every year too, without fail, the Auditors have refused to approve the management of those EU funds. The problem is one of failure: failure to control that the taxpayers’ money is properly spent. As recently as July, the Court of Auditors reported EUR 3 billion of waste in road construction projects. This audit only covered four countries so I fear that the overall figure across the EU would be much higher. If we did a proper job we would not need to engage in a multi-million information campaign ahead of the 2014 elections. EU taxpayers do not trust us because we do not look after their interests; we should stop putting more money into this black hole. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, at long last the saga that was the negotiation of the EU long-term budget, the MFF, has concluded. This House backed away from the frankly ridiculous EUR 1 trillion that it had been asking. We agree that EUR 960 billion is still a massive figure but it represents, for the first time since multiannual budgeting began in 1993, a reduction in the EU budget. This is something that, as you will know, I have been asking for since I first became an MEP. But the public will not be rejoicing. They know that the MFF is still full of vanity projects such as Galileo and the ineffective European External Action Service, headed by Catherine Ashton. While today is a step in the right direction, I fear that Parliament will, as in previous years, return like Oliver Twist to ask for more money. I hope flexibility does not mean a blank cheque book. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

Mr President, if anyone needed evidence of how inefficient the EU institutions are, then the seven years it has taken to finalise a revision of the OLAF regulatory framework is surely proof enough. It seems that even when agreement has been reached among institutions there is need for further amendments.  However, the most important issue here today is the independence of OLAF, which this framework actually fails to put right. The Anti-Fraud Office is primarily aimed at avoiding fraud and corruption affecting EU funds. It should there be, by its very definition, independent of the institutions involved in handling those funds – notably the European Commission, but also the European Parliament and the European Council. OLAF should report directly, without EU intermediaries, to the European citizens who fund the EU budget, and its regulation must not be subject to any politics. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, no one denies that well-funded companies and wealthy investors may be trying to avoid tax. The tax avoiders are mostly in Europe, America or other developed countries. However, when we talk about tax havens, they are mostly in small jurisdictions outside of those countries. This report is really a request for the EU to start controlling tax policy over which it has no competence. Tax is the competence of national governments in the EU and elsewhere. The truth is that clamping down on tax havens requires agreement between all the governments involved; otherwise, it is a pointless exercise. In any case we already have the OECD’s Financial Action Task Force working on this. Europe just wants to get its hands on what is at present a sovereign matter for the nations of Europe. One cannot help thinking that this is exactly what they wanted in the first place. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

Mr President, once again we are being asked whether or not we approve the management of EU funds by the European Commission. The Court of Auditors has, for the 18th year in a row, refused to clear the EU budget, but this has never led this Parliament to actually act. When the auditors talk about significant material errors, breach of public procurement rules, claims for non-existent animals and incorrect activation of entitlements, they are actually describing the way in which European taxpayers’ money is being misappropriated. The level of irregularities has actually gone up to almost 4%, so the question here is: when is the European Commission actually going to be held to account for this abominable failure? Because whatever blame we want to put on the beneficiaries, it is actually the Commission which asks for our taxes to fund the budgets and which should therefore ensure they are properly spent before releasing them. I am not holding my breath. This Parliament will vote to approve the EU accounts once again. However, the UK and the Netherlands have refused to approve them and I hope many more Member States will follow suit. Marta Andreasenon,  
on behalf of the ECR Group

 Mr President, this House should be the first to lead by example and cut our own costs in line with the austerity measures being imposed around Europe. While I recognise that Parliament’s administration has made an effort to achieve some reductions, there are still many areas where more could and should be done. The most obvious is the ‘three seat’ cost of Parliament. Why not cut out this complex arrangement, for which taxpayers pay more than EUR 250 million per year? The proposed budget includes another significant increase for European political parties – an expenditure line which will have grown by 50% in the last couple of years. What is the purpose of this increase if there will not be a European constituency in the coming elections and Members will be elected from national lists? Projects like the European House of History or the Parliamentarium also continue to absorb more taxpayers’ money. All these costs will not increase the visibility or the credibility of this institution. It is only the hard work and the integrity of the Members which will convince citizens of the importance of this institution. If we continue to ignore this reality we should not be surprised when few turn out to vote in the next European elections. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

Mr President, since I became an MEP I have been fighting for a reduction in the EU budget. The economic growth promised by the Lisbon Agenda and financed by the current long-term budget has instead brought economic stagnation. I fully support the deal negotiated by the British Prime Minister at the European Council. It represents the first cut in the EU budget since 1993. I have therefore voted in favour of my group’s MFF resolution which endorses the agreement reached by the prime ministers of the 27 Member States early in February 2013. Like other political groups, the ECR emphasises the need to spend more efficiently, rather than simply spend more. It enshrines sound financial management as the guiding principle of the EU budget. I regard the rejection of the Council agreement by the other groups as a slap in the face of European taxpayers. We should lead by example and share the austerity burden; instead the European Parliament has shown its gluttony. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, I find it ludicrous that this House is trying to push ahead on the negotiation of the 2014 budget, on the one hand, while on the other it refuses to back the agreement made by Heads of State on the seven-year budget starting next year. On top of this, the guidelines on the 2014 budget refer to extra payments that need to be covered for past and current years, with the amounts remaining totally unclear. The Commission and Parliament insist on using the word ‘deficit’, whereas this concept does not apply to the EU budget, as revenues are raised from Member States to cover the agreed budget. It is time for Parliament and the Council to call on the Commission to assume its responsibility on the budget and its implementation by providing reliable accounting information as to where and when EU taxpayers’ money is being spent. I am not therefore in a position to vote in favour of the Jensen report. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Mr President, the Multiannual Financial Framework has not actually been decided so this debate on 2014 budget guidelines appears to be premature. That aside, and given the economic situation of Europe, I believe it is now time to perform a cost-benefit analysis in regard to the whole of the EU budget. That cost-benefit analysis should start with all the mini-institutions that have been growing like mushrooms in the last decade.  Take for example the EEAS, the European External Action Service. What is the benefit that this institution brings to European citizens? Baroness Ashton has said that it will not replace national embassies. Great! So why do we need it? And the Committee of the Regions, has it actually helped regions develop their economies. No, it does not seem so. If the EU really wanted to help Member States and taxpayers, it would simply abandon budget lines that have no added value – but this will not happen. We will only continue to spend our time trying to window-dress little cuts here and there. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, I must admit that my curiosity was raised by this report. Contrary to its normal strategy of centralising and seizing control as much as possible, the EU is now proposing that banks and investment firms assess for themselves the credit risk of entities or instruments in which they invest, and is asking them not to rely on external ratings. The report even proposes to take ratings out of the Financial Regulation and eliminate risk-weighting of assets through external rating or internal models.  How this would contribute to making the evaluation of risk independent or avoid conflicts of interests, is really a mystery to me. Whether we like it or not, these agencies provide an independent view, and the fact that some would find that they have become too powerful is no basis for them being muscled out in such a way. It is as if the EU wants to remove any analytical road blocks that stand in its way. I wonder why. In response to Mrs Lulling, I would like to say yes, the UK should leave the EU. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, the negotiation of the annual EU budget has become a farce. Last year Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed up to an increase of just over 2 % for 2012. Yet last October the Commission was asking for no less than EUR 9 billion of extra cash and this House has joined the cry for more money. This is a 9 % increase, not a 2 % increase.  Of course last year’s agreement allowed for an increase in the legal obligations the EU could enter into, the so-called commitments. But this fact seemed to go unnoticed by the Heads of State. The fact is that we face the same situation for 2013, as the legal obligations are now growing by up to EUR 151 billion and who picks up the tab? The taxpayers. Frontline services are being cut in Member States while the EU gets on with its own wasteful agenda.  Mr Cameron, please do not come back claiming victory this time. It would be a serious insult to your people.  (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I think that this is not the main issue. The main issue is where we are spending money. You are now running a political campaign against Mr Farage, but that is up to you.

Mr President, it is no surprise that only ten Member States at most are willing to adopt a financial transaction tax. The majority of states know that this tax would only push the financial sector out of Europe, to the further detriment of their economies. Insisting on forcing this tax through by means of enhanced cooperation will only make it more evident that it is the wrong way to go. The ill-fated Swedish initiative back in the 1980s should be seen as a good reason for not proceeding. In addition, there are two aspects of the proposal that have not been laid out in clear terms and which are a matter of concern. The first and most important one is how it will affect non-participating Member States – because it will, notably in the case of cross-border transactions. The second one is how this FTT will be spent.  Regardless, I hope that the British Prime Minister will protect the City from any implications of this tax. Marta Andreasen,

– Madam President, this is now shamefully the 18th year in a row that the auditors cannot clear the EU budget. Worse, 50 % of the samples taken by the auditors show irregularities. The excuses the Commission puts forward are always the same: it is the fault of the Member States: they commit the irregularities. But taxpayers entrust their monies to the European Commission, which abjectly fails to perform essential controls before it hands the cash over to the Member States. This House is also to blame by continually rubber-stamping the EU budget on the basis that ‘error’ does not necessarily mean ‘fraud’. Well, if a farmer gets money for the welfare of his 150 sheep and the auditors find that he does not have any, in the real world this would be considered fraud. The point is that if the Commission refuses to take responsibility for taxpayers’ money and blames Member States, why does it ask for more money to fund those same Member States? This is yet another reason why the EU budget should be cut. What are we waiting for? Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, what has happened with EU budget investment in the last seven years? Well, we all know where we stand today. Budgeting is not a field where the EU can claim success. Why are we putting more money into agricultural funding that amounts, at present, to over 40 % of the budget? We are paying for farmers not to grow food, although the market is there. Have the billions paid out in structural funds to countries like Greece, Portugal or Spain stemmed the crisis there? No, they have not. If there was a serious will to use the budget to develop Europe’s economy, a major rethink would have taken place many years ago. Instead, every year we are asked to top up the same old budget lines. The EU budget for the 2014-2020 period should be reduced drastically to allow Member States to decide where they want to put their taxpayers’ money. The UK should not only veto an increase, but should demand a significant reduction. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is no secret to anybody that the conciliation for 2013 failed before it even started. This was due to the fact that the Commission came up with a request for EUR 9 billion more to cover this year’s payments. I have been deeply sceptical about the need for this extra cash. Most Member States cannot afford cofinancing in these times of crisis. We need to remember that in February this year, two months after the close of the 2011 accounts, the Budget Commissioner told us that there was a shortfall of EUR 11 billion. Then in April, two months later, he told us there was a EUR 1.5 billion surplus. Then, at the conciliation last week, Mr Lewandowski came up with a reduction on payment needs for 2012 of EUR 1.5 billion. So which number should we believe now? This behaviour has seriously affected the credibility of the negotiators, notably the Commission. No more money should be granted to the Commission as long as it fails to produce reliable and precise information. I have been saying this for many years now.

– The only compromise that the Council and the Member States assumed was the number that was agreed upon last December for the 2012 budget. The fact that the Council said that they would put in more money if it was needed refers to unexpected events, such as the flooding in Italy. However, coming up with EUR 9 billion, which is almost 7 % of the budget for 2012, is really unacceptable and shows that there is no accounting that can be relied upon in the Commission.

– I believe, Mr Garriga Polledo, that we should have proof that the projects have effectively been run. For me, that would be the evidence that we need the money. I am sorry to say this, but we do not have a need popping up from one day to the next which justifies the EUR 9 billion. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteur, we should call this report what it really is: a cry for help by the European Parliament to remain relevant. The lesson still has not been learnt. We find ourselves in the current financial mess in large part due to the inefficiency of the European institutions. Angela Merkel recognised this by deciding to act intergovernmentally instead of interinstitutionally, during all the peaks of the crisis. Now we are being asked to empower the same institutions to be the supervisors of this new European Monetary Union, which will also result in an additional burden to taxpayers. In a nutshell, this will entail more staff and even more money and will further remove powers from national supervisors, while the main problems remain unresolved. The EU needs to learn to do much less and do it better. More Europe simply makes a deep hole much deeper. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, Erasmus started 25 years ago, and three million people have taken part. During the period 2007-2013 the EU has paid out grants worth EUR 3 billion on Erasmus. However, the economy has shrunk and youth unemployment has grown massively to 11.7 %. Furthermore, the grant gives an average EUR 300 per month, which is insufficient to cover the basic costs of living. If we add travel costs to this we can estimate that a family needs to pay at least EUR 5 000 per year on top of the grant to cover the total cost of one of its members doing Erasmus. How many families can afford this in these times of crisis? Considering the lack of impact on employment and economic growth that the Erasmus programme has had over the last decade, and given that it can only be afforded by those that are well off, we should scrap it. There are many other priorities that need more urgent attention. Those who find it indispensable to have this development should pay out of their own pocket instead of imposing the burden on the taxpayer. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, whether it agrees or not, the European Commission has contributed to the crisis by distributing the European budget without exercising proper controls. Also, through multiple directives, it has imposed a huge burden of regulation on Member States, forcing prohibitive costs on private entrepreneurship. How can the same institution which has failed so gravely make judgments on where and how Member States need to put their taxpayers’ money? SMEs are the backbone of economic expansion and recovery. But by urging the Member States to create access to finance for SMEs, we will achieve nothing, as their coffers are now empty. Why not use the bank bailout money to help SMEs instead of helping failed banks? Why not look for more flexible measures instead of calling for the inclusion of a core set of rights in workers’ contracts? The Commission has not learnt any lessons from the past. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this House is stretching the meaning of the word ‘investment’ beyond elasticity. Can any MEP claim that the many billion euros of taxpayers’ money spent on the Lisbon Agenda have delivered any return? Let us look at the evidence. In 2007, EU unemployment was 7.3 %; today it stands at 10.5 %. In Spain, one of the biggest recipients of cohesion funding over recent years, the jobless figure today sits at 25 %. GDP for the European Union has been flat. We should also not forget that the Court of Auditors has not given EU spending an overall clean bill of health for over a decade. The MFF has been built around a legacy of failed projects, and the 2014-2020 MFF simply seeks to top up those failed projects. Employment comes from new industry and new industry requires capital, flexibility and less red tape – none of which the European Union helps with. The MFF needs a haircut and not a Financial Transaction Tax to pay for more waste. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I supported Amendment 1263 on the House of European History because it reduces the budget of the European Parliament by 5.3 million; even though I believe it does not go far enough, it is a reduction. Ideally the vanity project should be wound up and the budget line removed. I voted for Amendment 964 on ITER because I am in favour of reducing the European Union budget, and Amendment 964 was to reduce payments by EUR 490 million. However, I do not support the intent of the author of the amendment which was to eliminate nuclear power. I fully support nuclear power and, if the British people were not sending so much money to Brussels more would be available for investment in the British nuclear industry. I supported Amendment 754 because I oppose EU funds, which are really the taxes of British and European citizens, being used for aid to tobacco producers. Marta Andreasen,

. – Mr President, a 7 % increase for 2013 is outrageous. Does anybody in this House seriously believe that we will help recovery by funding space projects? Why is Galileo still getting EUR 160 million, almost three times more than last year? This is a badly-managed project producing technology that rivals already brought to the market years ago. Why are projects like the Earth monitoring programme and the space research programme getting over EUR 300 million? I can assure you that none of these vanity projects will be putting food on the tables of Europe’s growing number of increasingly angry poor people. Then we have the famous supervisory bodies created a couple of years ago to avoid any more financial scandals. They have not done so. Their reward is EUR 20 million. Would Europe fall apart if all these projects were not funded, along with the EEAS, worth EUR 430 million? Absolutely not. Forget a rise, President; forget a freeze, Mr Cameron. What this ridiculous budget really needs is a cut of at least 10 %. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and legislative resolution because I believe the common fisheries policy cannot be reformed, least of all by its authors (the Commission). It has caused such damage to the industry and to fish that it is irreformable. I believe that power on this policy, as on others, should be returned to the Member States. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

in writing. 
– I voted against the Färm report because my experience with the management and supervision of European funding is not good. Regional funds which require cofinancing are poorly controlled, with responsibility being shirked by the Commission which is ultimately in charge. Project bonds should be a good means to get private funding for these infrastructure projects, but alas, with the EU managing them, I anticipate poor control and indifferent results. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– I voted against draft amending budget number 3/2012, the Balzani report, because my party’s policy is to return unused European funds to the Member States and not to put them aside for future use by the European Union. Member States are having difficult budgets at present and are cutting across the board, even frontline services. At times such as these, there is no excuse for these funds being diverted for the questionable projects of the EU. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, here we go again. In the worst financial crisis in living memory, this House comes up with more unrealistic and irresponsible demands. It simply beggars belief that a majority here can even dare to ask for a 6.8% increase. The idea that genuine growth and employment can be delivered by the EU budget is simply ridiculous. Hundreds of billions have been spent to date that have added up to precisely nothing in terms of growth. Many believe, as I do, that the EU and its policies are, to a large extent, responsible for this crisis. The Commission, in particular, has failed to control the use of EU funding entrusted to it by the taxpayers, while targeting the funds towards supporting its own heavy regulation and the EU project as a whole. Now this House wants to reward this failure with an increase. If you are listening, Mr Cameron, I have a straight-talking message for you: continue to send money to Brussels and you are effectively transferring power to an unelected, irresponsible and hugely wasteful bureaucracy. For goodness sake, give the British people a break and cut our contribution to the EU budget. I am calling for a reduction, not for a freeze. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, an astronomical amount of taxpayers’ money has been given to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain by the EU since 2010: EUR 285 billion. You heard me correctly – EUR 285 billion! What has happened to this money? The EU’s failure to keep tabs on funding means that nobody can know for sure. Now, more money is wanted to waste on promoting deeper European integration. The Lisbon Agenda was a disaster. Can anyone here say that Europe is the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world? Only if they are an ostrich. Now the EU wants to pour billions more into the 2020 plan. The new own resources being proposed, namely the financial transaction tax, mean that this money will be even more unaccountable. This House, in approving this framework, is voting for a continuation of the last ten wasteful years. I shudder at that thought. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, Ms Gomes is wrong. She is talking about something different. The EUR 285 billion is the EU budget that was paid into these Member States. This money is not to be returned and it does not earn any interest. Ms Gomes, you are confused. I am not talking about the bailout. I am talking about the EU budget that was supposed to grow the economies of the countries concerned and did not grow those economies. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, these proposals are a classic case of too little and too late. Greece is under the water and Ireland and Portugal are not far behind. But now Spain, a far larger economy, is having to bail out its own banks. Why should private debt be turned into public debt? Whether the money comes from the EU or from national treasuries, the story remains the same. The people who are now suffering from severe belt-tightening will be the ones who end up paying for the wrong decisions made by private companies. What this Parliament should be demanding is a serious investigation into Spain’s banks, notably Bankia, to understand how a hole of EUR 20 billion could suddenly emerge. Bailing out such banks without investigating how and where the money has gone is an act of irresponsibility and contempt towards European citizens. Enough is enough. We need to call time on this approach. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, we are about to allow the EU to finance itself directly from taxpayers’ pockets without negotiations with anybody, not even the Council. We cannot think that giving the EU tax-raising powers without normal democratic scrutiny is acceptable. It is not. In addition, the legal argument on which this House is trying to base the establishment of an FTT is incorrect. The different sizes of the financial industry in some Member States are not an indication of distorted competition, but rather due to historic developmental differences. This should never have been interpreted as a reason for tax harmonisation. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to tax both sides of the transaction. If one of the parties is not a signatory to the treaty, then the other party would have to raise both amounts. What would then happen to the UK veto? It would be useless. The UK taxpayer would end up paying the tax on all transactions that involved Member States who have signed the treaty. However, it would not enjoy a reduction in its EU contribution as it has not signed up to this treaty. Of course, this House and the Commission must know that as long as the FTT does not become a global tax, the financial sector could move to other, more tax-friendly locations. But they feel the EU can afford the loss of this very important industry. It cannot. (The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I have shared my time between the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Petitions, the Committee on the Economic and Financial Crisis and the Policy Challenges Committee. Sometimes, these committees happen to have meetings at the same time. In the last vote on the financial transaction tax, I sent Mr Paška to vote in my place, with my voting list, so in fact my vote was there, and I was represented by somebody else. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

Blue-card answer. 
– Firstly, you would have to prove to me that, in fact, there has not been any relocation away from these countries. I am not sure. I do not have any proof. On the other hand, maybe these countries do not have a similar tax to finance their own budgets. The UK has a stamp duty which it will need to use to finance its own budget. Once this FTT is imposed on the UK, I do not know how the UK is going to finance its budget. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, the procedure whereby we in this House approve the use of the EU budget by the Commission and the other institutions is our greatest responsibility as representatives of the citizens of the Member States. Yet, year after year, while the Court of Auditors fails to give the EU spending a clean bill of health, this House is happy to approve the management’s performance. The auditors’ report for the year 2010 reveals that the error rate – a fine name for the irregular use of funds – has grown from 3.3% to 3.7%. They add that 50% of the transactions sampled were affected by errors. How can we tell taxpayers that their money has been properly spent when we have this situation? Worse, how can we ask taxpayers to put even more into policy areas such as cohesion, energy and transport, where the error rate has increased to an astonishing 7.7%? The increase in the number of agencies from three to 24 in a decade is a matter of concern. The Commission seems to have little control over them, which means that, in the discharge reports, one sees the same stories again and again: conflicts of interest and a revolving door to outside employers at least as efficient as the ones in this building. Yet while this House is prepared to turn a blind eye to the deficiencies of those responsible for most of the budget, including itself, it puts great energy into refusing to approve the management of the Council’s budget. It is not that I want to defend the Council, but this is merely playing politics – and that, in essence, is what the discharge procedure has become, a political game. So, dear taxpayers, nobody actually cares how your money is spent. The solution? Stop sending money to Brussels! Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I am in favour of fusion energy; however, having the EU involved is not the way to achieve it. I voted against the Balzani report on the Draft amending budget no 1 of 2012 because it contributes to the continuation of wasting large amounts of money for a huge, controversial project with a slipping deadline and escalating costs that may never achieve its aim. The ITER agreement was signed in 2006 for a total of EUR 10 billion. It is now already going to cost EUR 15 billion and this figure will probably increase. There is little accountability to taxpayers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I am not against fusion energy. However, when it comes to ITER, the European Commission should have learned from its mistakes. Unfortunately this never happens. For example, the Galileo project was estimated to cost EUR 7 billion in the year 2000; by 2010 the estimated costs had tripled to EUR 22 billion. The cost continues to climb even further with no real end in sight. The parallels are alarming. ITER’s partners are saying they can only build a stripped-down version of the device by 2018, five years later than the date set in the original agreement. The first experiments intended to validate fusion for power will not take place until the end of 2025. Construction costs are likely to double from the original 2006 estimate of EUR 5 billion to EUR 10 billion. The cost of ITER’s operational phase – another EUR 5 billion over 20 years – may also rise. As 90% of the project is directly managed by the participating states, we are unlikely ever to know what the final costs will be. Taxpayers deserve to know the cost of ITER as they are ultimately paying for it, yet this House continues to approve the financing of a project that has already cost over 50% more than the original estimates. The EU’s approach to public finance is catastrophic. On Monday Commissioner Lewandowski told us that the 2011 payments budget was in surplus to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion, yet a couple of months ago he told us it was short to the amount of EUR 11 billion. Which version is true? Does he not know how much money he has in the bank at the end of each day? I know this and everybody knows this. ITER, like Galileo and the EU budget, is becoming an absurdity, but the taxpayers who are left to foot the bill for these projects are not laughing at all, I can assure you. We should scrap this project altogether. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, this Parliament should not be asking for more money from taxpayers, but less. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund a European History House or other narcissistic projects. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund expensive delegation trips to some paradise island. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund synthetic European political parties. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund communication and advertising campaigns to make itself known to the public. What this Parliament needs is to behave responsibly and act genuinely in the interests of the citizens of the Member States. In this sense, the first thing it should do is to stop burdening Europe’s people with heavy and useless regulation that frequently drives them out of business. The second thing it should do is take the lead in avoiding, condemning and sanctioning all wasteful and irregular use of taxpayers’ funds. I will vote against this budget proposal and urge the British Prime Minister to call for a 10% reduction in the EU budget for the European Parliament for 2013. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),

–
 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we already know that billions in taxpayers’ money was wasted in financing the failed Lisbon Agenda, but the EU institutions will never admit their responsibility for helping to create this crisis. Instead, they are asking for more money from EU citizens to finance another failure to come: the 2020 Agenda. This is treating EU citizens as fools. When will this Parliament realise that stimulating growth and jobs requires much less red tape and much less pointless legislation? Why can this Parliament not admit that growth-targeted spending would be best directed at Member State level? Year after year, this Parliament is happy to put more taxpayers’ money in the hands of the Commission, an institution which – as the auditors tell us – is unable to ensure the proper use of EU funding. Of course, the Commission never runs a deficit, and it never will, because it can always go back to the Member States and tax them more to balance its books. If this House refuses to show common sense and responsibility, it will be the architect of its own downfall. I, for one, am calling on the British Government to reduce its contribution to the 2013 EU budget by 10% in comparison with this year’s contribution. However, when it comes to the UK coalition government, I will not be holding my breath. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in the middle of this crisis in which the EU is imposing cuts on Member States, this House still thinks it has the right to ask for inflationary increases. It cannot even agree on what the inflation percentage is but, whether it is 1.9% or 3%, the fact is that this EU bureaucracy is already bloated and needs to go on a hard diet. The cost of this Parliament, which has grown disproportionately, amounts to more than GBP 2 million per MEP. This is not value for money. Entertainment and representation costs have grown by 160% in the last four years. We should do away with this expenditure. The House of European History, with an initial cost estimated in excess of EUR 50 million, and with running costs of more than EUR 11 million per annum, is an extravagance at any time. We should be dropping the whole project. Funding for European political parties and foundations has grown 176% in the last four years. We do not need these European political parties. We MEPs are elected by our constituents or on national party lists. Prime Minister David Cameron is calling for a freeze, but what we need is a significant reduction in this Parliament’s budget and overall, in the whole budget of the European Union, at least a 10% decrease for next year. Without a cut, we are behaving like fat cats. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),

– I voted against this resolution on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) because of economic, legal, environmental and moral reasons. The EU and Morocco concluded a FPA on 22 May 2006. An outside consultancy prepared an ex-post evaluation report, on behalf of the European Commission, which evaluates the first four years of the FPA with Morocco. On a general note, it states that ‘the results of this first four-year period of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco are generally rather disappointing’ as the agreement fails to stabilise the EU market and to develop the fisheries sector. Moreover, the population of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi people who suffer under the unlawful and unacceptable occupation of their country by Morocco, does not benefit from this agreement. Morocco has no right to dispose of the natural resources of a territory which does not fall under its sovereignty. For more than 30 years, the Western Sahara’s problem has been dealt with by the United Nations, but without any progress whatsoever. By rejecting the FPA, the European Parliament sent a strong signal to the Moroccan Government that the EU cannot support an agreement with a country which violates human rights. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the European Parliament and the Commission’s demand for a 5% increase for the 2012 budget was ridiculous, but the Council’s acceptance of a real 2% rise is a slap in the face for taxpayers in Europe. In a doomed pursuit of its Lisbon agenda, the EU has squandered more than one trillion euro of taxpayers’ money. I say the number again: one trillion euro. Funds are given to the Commission which fails to properly control their use, and yet it always comes back to us for more. The present economic and financial situation in Europe is, without a doubt, a reflection of the abject failure in the use of funds. While this wasteful spree goes on in Brussels, Mr Osborne in the UK has announced further budget cuts. So I tell the government in the UK today: no, Mr Hague, the EU budget is not under control; no, Mr Cameron, a 2% rise is not a freeze. For goodness sake, stop sending more British taxpayers’ money to the European Union. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, 31, 32, 33 to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, 25 years ago today I went to a football match along with thousands of Liverpool supporters. Ninety-six of us never came home.

 Madam President, one of the three policy options being discussed as a means of addressing problems around the acquisition and preservation of pension rights is legislation at European Union level. Nothing would alarm my constituency in the West Midlands more than this. The use of best practices in a free and competitive market has always ensured the supremacy of the City of London in the financial services sector. Competition and innovation have ensured that British businesses have always led the way. As the workforce becomes more mobile, it is to innovators – not legislators – that we look to find the answers to the new challenges. Innovation creates; legislation stifles. In any case, the idea of having their pensions legislated by the same people who brought us the eurozone crisis would chill the hearts of most British people. My message to the European Commission is this, to parody an old saying: go and legislate on your own doorstep. Hands off our pensions! Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I commend Ms McIntyre for her efforts in this report and I share with her my desire for greater success for small and medium enterprises, and indeed their ability to create jobs. I think in the UK SMEs create up to about 43% of the workforce, the highest ratio. We differ, however, on how to go about it. She obviously believes that she can achieve this from inside the European Union, in what is probably one of her Conservative Party’s many hopes for reform. I feel this is unlikely. In 2009 when I attended, with Mr Bill Benyon, the Federation for Small Businesses (FSB) hustings in Birmingham, the FSB manifesto said, please, no more legislation from the European Union, please cut the red tape. Ms McIntyre, in the two and a half years you have been here you have failed to cut one piece of red tape. And indeed Mr Rübig, who submitted a question, talks about gold-plating. Well, the UK leads on gold-plating and this Conservative government has not done one thing to cut gold-plating. The Conservative government is losing us jobs in Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, my question is: with unemployment still a problem across Europe, and indeed in the UK, does Mr Farage think it is a fair use of taxpayers’ money – namely his secretarial allowance – not only to employ his wife Kirsten but also his former mistress, Annabelle Fuller? Is this a responsible use of taxpayers’ money, Mr Farage? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). - 
 Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his honesty. As he points out, the EU institutions are responsible for the conditions of the economic adjustment programmes that are bringing hardship and despair to so many people. The EU was ill-prepared and ill-equipped to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. It is young people who are suffering the highest levels of unemployment; there is a decline in job quality and a deterioration in basic labour standards. However, it is not just Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus – the countries that have seen their economic governance fall under the control of the Troika – which are affected. My constituency, the West Midlands, has always been an industrial powerhouse, a centre of innovation and manufacturing excellence, but the eurozone crisis, burdensome EU red tape and the relocation of traditional industries to other EU Member States have left us in a situation where unemployment currently stands at 8.1[nbsp ]%, which is above the UK national average. Some 220[nbsp ]000 people in the region are unemployed. To you, that may be just a statistic, but to 220[nbsp ]000 of my constituents and their families – people with a traditionally strong work ethic – it is a tragedy. It spells frustration; it is a shame; it means young people leaving education but seeing no career, no prospects and no future. The Troika is addressing the symptoms of the crisis but we need to look at the cause. The eurozone is bringing us all down. The good news is that, through hard work and inward investment, the number of people unemployed in the West Midlands is falling. But perhaps the biggest boost to our economy will be when, following a referendum, we free ourselves from the economic basket-case that the EU is becoming. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is anathema to my constituents. It is promoted as a benefit of the EU, yet we see precious little of the money from the fund – which is, after all, UK taxpayers’ money – being returned to us, and when it does come it is much reduced and has strings attached. One ERDF-funded project is the Coventry Arena. In 2003 Coventry City Council received GBP[nbsp ]4.75[nbsp ]million from the fund. Last June I submitted a freedom-of-information request to the council seeking to ascertain the purpose of the grant. At the same time, I submitted an official question to the Commission seeking the same information. Imagine my surprise when the answers did not match. In fact, they could not be further apart. With other information that has come to my attention in the past year, and given Coventry City Council’s constant refusal to meet me about these discrepancies in funding, I can only conclude that they have something to hide. When the Commission sought clarification of the situation, the council changed its position. Today I can confirm that I am referring the matter to the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, so that it can investigate this use of taxpayers’ money. There is something rotten at the heart of Coventry City Council. Is there something fraudulent as well? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I represent the West Midlands in the United Kingdom where we have had terrible weather conditions. This has caused a tremendous amount of damage through floods, namely in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  At the last plenary here in Strasbourg, a Spanish MEP stood up and said he wanted more funds for Spain to deal with weather damage. That is all well and good, but Spain is already a net taker from the European Union. What about my constituents? What about the people in the West Midlands who do not get any of this emergency fund? I am concerned about them. I am concerned about the impact on their lives.  The UK pays GDP[nbsp ]52 million a day to the European Union. When do we get our share back? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, this is a procedural point of order. President Schulz and, I believe, the Conference of Presidents have made it clear that if you are on a speaking list, you cannot have a blue card.

 Madam President, since the Estrela report was voted on in the European Parliament, I have received more correspondence from constituents on this report than almost any other. It is of course a vital policy area that affects us all as individuals and as a society. It is also an area in which certain groups may be particularly vulnerable. This includes those in developing nations, the economically-disadvantaged and the poorly-informed or educated, and those women who live in societies in which women are treated unequally or even regarded simply as property. Through my work on the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, I have witnessed such situations at first hand. There are important debates to be had: access to contraception, sexual health, education and healthcare, and abortion are just some of the issues. It will also come as a surprise to learn that in several countries in the EU the age of consent is as low as fourteen. These debates must include all actors in society – not just politicians, but also healthcare professionals, teachers, parents and, given the moral implications, the Church. The Church should not be made an enemy. The Estrela report, however, appears to be dominated by a political agenda and in my opinion is unacceptable. That is why I could not support it, as I believe this to be a national competence. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). - 
 Madam President, this is the first point of order: when an MEP asks for a procedural point of order, the President must give way. I think this is in the Rules of Procedure, and you failed to do that. I am actually calling for you to suspend this debate and put in place a chair who can competently take this debate. This has been absolute chaos. Your absolute bigoted bias in this debate has been absolutely disgraceful. Please vacate the chair and put someone else more competent in. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is poignant that Greece should take over the Presidency at this time. Greece is the living embodiment of the failure of the Troika and indeed the euro project. Mr Samaras, you talk about the mistakes of your country over decades. Surprisingly, you failed to put any blame where it truly belongs, namely on the pro-federalising Eurocrats who ignore the Maastricht convergence criteria to push on with their project of a federal Euro-state. Linking the Greek economy with such a powerhouse as Germany was utter madness, and your people paid the price – not least with a suicide rate that increased by 46 %. In your speech you stated that your first commitment was to ever-closer EU integration. Are you not learning from the lessons of history? Are you not condemned to relive them? You cannot play political make-believe with people’s lives. Your people and people across Europe came out onto the streets to show their displeasure at the medication for the Eurocrats’ mental illness. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, and this year people across Europe will have the chance to put a dagger in the heart of the European Union. A significant number of these people have plenty of time to go to the polling station as they are unemployed, a core failure of the EU project. Mr Samaras, you are in make-believe land if you think the EU is the solution. In the UK we also have a leader who lives in make-believe land and who believes that he can renegotiate serious powers from the EU before a referendum. But we have heard this con trick before. The British people have waited far too long to have the choice to leave this corrupt and doomed mess that is the EU. In May’s elections we will let the people decide. We will put the option on the ballot paper in Britain for the people to demand a referendum now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, as a member of the Chilean delegation I visited Chile last year. I am quite happy with the Free Trade Agreement we have with Chile, and I agree that Chile has proved itself to be a strong and reliable trade partner. Great strides forward have been made in Chile with respect to human rights. It is now a fully functioning democracy and has put aside all its past troubles, but I think we must be very strong with the human rights element throughout Latin America.  I attend lots of talks where people ask me about Free Trade Agreements, as they wonder what exactly they are and I have to tell them. They ask if the United Kingdom would not have a Free Trade Agreement if it left the European Union. That is a good question, because here we are with a Free Trade Agreement with countries on the other side of the world, yet the threat to the people that I represent is that if you leave the EU you would not have a Free Trade Agreement. I think it is probably relevant that I make the point here in the Chamber at some point, so I have done so tonight. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, well, here we are still in very great economic hardship across the continent, and what does the European Union decide to discuss at the top of the agenda for a Council meeting? Defence. I would argue that across Europe – not just the United Kingdom – defence is way down the list of people's concerns and of what they want to discuss. They want to discuss employment, they want to discuss how much it costs them to live, growing inflation, but that is not what you want to talk about. You want to talk defence. We have heard the Commission here talking about competing with the USA. Why would you want to compete with the USA? We are 28 sovereign nations. There is no will, in the United Kingdom at least, to be one sovereign nation called the European Union. You have to have the consent of people, but you do not want that. You want to move forward in this one superstate. We should not be competing with the USA. We should be working with the USA. Why do we want to reinvent the wheel? We have NATO and NATO is tried and tested. We need to reinvigorate NATO. That is what we need to do.  And employment? And the euro? You are congratulating yourself because Latvia is joining. You have had sticking plaster over sticking plaster on your euro single currency and the wound has congealed, and you are putting another one on with Latvia. But we all know what happens when you leave a plaster on. The wound becomes infected and when you finally have to remove that plaster, it is far more painful – and that is as good an analogy as I have for the euro. It will be a painful, slow decline and, when it finally rips apart, it will hurt and it will hurt the people of Europe. Stop this madness now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, the European Social Fund’s remit is to invest in people and to support employment, especially amongst the young who see their futures receding in a Europe of austerity and unemployment. I know the EU food aid programme, the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived, is also to receive its funding through the ESF.  In my constituency of the West Midlands, my office has collected over three tonnes of food for distribution to food banks. Across the country, more than 350 000 people are dependent on these food banks to feed themselves and their families. It has been estimated that if current trends continue, more than half a million people could be receiving food parcels by 2016. These are basic supplies, not luxury foods and wine such as those that will be enjoyed in the Members’ dining room today. A recent study found that malnutrition is on the rise in the UK. One in ten older people are malnourished. This fact is a warning sign and it is where the problem first becomes apparent. The Archbishop of Canterbury just three days ago insisted on a plea for more financial support for the rapidly expanding network of food banks. We see it here debating new legislation whilst people are suffering back home. There is a joke that is popular in England at the moment. President Barroso is asked by a Greek citizen: Have we achieved full European integration? The answer from Barroso is: Oh no, it will get a lot worse yet. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, we certainly need more women in our boardrooms. We certainly need more women in politics. There can be no doubt about that. The question is how we go about it. I do not believe, Ms Reding, that your proposals will help the situation. I think that, on the contrary, they will make it worse. Women business leaders tell me that, actually, they do not want to be put on boards by patronising laws. They want to be put there on merit. Now, speaking as someone who has been discriminated against, I think all forms of discrimination are wrong, as is positive discrimination, because positive discrimination is discrimination, and discrimination creates victims. It does not matter what gender you are: if you believe in equality and you create discrimination, you create a victim. Ms Reding, do not legislate to make victims. That is not what you are in your job to do. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, businesses – small, medium and large – have been contacting me in their droves about this much-vaunted EU investment, this mythical EU money that the pro-European argument says the UK is so heavily dependent on. Let us put aside the argument that EU money actually does not exist. The fact is that there have been no calls, from 2000 onwards, for grants. This is because delays in agreeing budgets have led to indecision and confusion over such EU funds. Civil society, the bedrock of democracy, is promised EU grants, but again there has been too much uncertainty and, more disastrously, inaction. I note, on the other hand, that the EU is not too slow when taking our money – our taxpayers’ money – but is too arrogant and negligent in throwing back some crumbs. No wonder the people of the United Kingdom have decided – and want to decide in a referendum – that they no longer want to be part of this sham and that they want to spend their money in the United Kingdom, not propping up some failing countries across Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, this is on a point of order which I will come to, but as a Member representing the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom where Malala now resides and where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, I congratulate this remarkable young woman who is deserving of this prize.  My point of order is quite significant. It is incredibly disappointing that you disrespected this Chamber and that the announcement was not made here live. It was announced on Twitter 30 minutes ago. I think you Mr President have disrespected this Chamber by announcing it on Twitter before doing so in this Chamber. (Mixed reactions) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, I would question the title of this debate about the Rise of right-wing extremism in Europe. Surely it should be about ‘extremism’. Commissioner Reding, I know your desire for equality, maybe you can tell us when we are going to debate ‘left-wing’ extremism, just in the name of equality. A key dynamic in politics is the relationship between the centre and the periphery. The centre, where power lies, in a truly democratic society is in a constant state of flux as opinion, debate and events filter to the centre and shift our values and priorities; this is very healthy. However, if those in power at the centre refuse to listen to the people whose concerns may be inconvenient, then by ignoring them they push them further out towards the periphery. They push them towards the extremes. Extreme thought, extreme speech and, ultimately, extreme acts.  It is no surprise to political observers in Britain that the far right only ever takes seats from the left: our Labour party, not the Conservative party. When Prime Minister Gordon Brown infamously labelled the respectable Labour voter, Gillian Duffy, as a bigot – simply for expressing genuine concerns about immigration and economic policy that differed to his own – he became a recruiting sergeant for extremists.  The blame for the rise of extremism lies at the feet of the political class that refuses to take account of the opinions and concerns of the electorate and the people to whom they should be accountable. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, well, here we go again. Squirm time for the European bureaucrats. They must really hate this, having to answer and put forward their figures because, seriously, they do not like scrutiny and they do not like transparency. This whole report lacks scrutiny, and it lacks transparency in the withholding of documents relating to significant expenditure – namely the purchase of the Residence Palace in Brussels, as previously mentioned – and in the refusal of the Council to address questions raised by a democratically-elected Parliament. A democratically elected Parliament! Her Majesty’s Government has drawn attention in the last few days to a cosy agreement in place since the 1970s, that two institutions would not scrutinise each other’s spending. Why are you so afraid of democratic scrutiny? You control Europe, you spend taxpayers’ money, your accounts for the whole of this institution have not been audited for 18 years and you do not care about democracy. I told my constituents in the West Midlands, the industrial heartland of the United Kingdom about this. I am not sure that they actually believed me. Incidentally, we British have a name for opaque and cosy arrangements such as these. We call them Spanish practices. I am very pleased that the rapporteur advocates voting against discharge of the 2011 budget. Of course, any agreement for scrutiny of another institution should be mutual. I would welcome scrutiny of this institution’s spending by the Council and I think the people of Great Britain would also welcome it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am amazed that we have had this State of the Union address today. I am surprised that Mrs Merkel has not asked us to postpone it until after the German general election. Well, Mr Barroso, this was your fourth and last State of the Union address and you have brought along the rest of your appointed Commission – for support. Never before has a tier of this Parliament been filled with such incompetence and failure. A question, why is it that it is the President of the unelected arm of the EU that gives this address? Why is it not President Schulz? One Member of your Commission is here today, despite only having an attendance record of 52%, almost as low as a UKIP MEP. Your flagship policy, when you became President, was the much-vaunted Lisbon Strategy which seeks to make the EU the most dynamic economy in the world. That sank without trace. In fact the EU has gone into reverse. Unemployment, especially among youth, is rocketing and little Miss Red Tape sitting next to you is not helping. Mr Barroso, your own Commission’s poll shows there is no trust in the EU. The people of the biggest five countries feel the EU is not working. Two-thirds of people across the EU think their views are not being heard. No wonder – but when they do express an opinion, for example in a rare referendum, they are treated with contempt and told that somehow they do not understand. The arrogance is palpable. The people must be listened to. Let the people decide. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, I was extremely disappointed that Mr Barroso did not answer my main question: why it should be he, the unelected representative of an EU institution, giving the State of the Union address rather than the elected representative, Mr Schulz. Maybe you could help me on this point, Mr Barroso? We do not agree on much, and I do not agree with your vision of a united Europe, but I do agree with you, Mr Barroso, that if the club is going to prosper, if it is going to work, you need all the members inside working towards that. I need to ask you then: why do you not challenge the UK to put up or shut up? Why do you go along with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, pretending that he can renegotiate to recover powers from the European Union? Are you saying that he can renegotiate certain items from the Treaty of Rome? Can you just make it clear, once and for all, that renegotiation of significant powers such as the Social Chapter is not possible? Is it not damaging to the European Union to have the UK in its current predicament until 2017? Is it not time for the UK and its people to decide, sooner rather than later, whether they want the country to remain a member of the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, these elections have had progressively lower turnouts, election by election. In fact the electorate is generally voting on national issues, which shows that the plan for a federal Europe does not really have public consent, does it? Even where there have been referendums, you federalists have been defeated until you have made the voters vote again. You do not care about the voters of Europe, do you? Mr Duff, the British press has today carried criticism of your plan for pan-European political parties to participate in our elections. What you clearly do not understand is that the people do not want this. Latvian accession to the single currency was approved today by this Parliament, despite an admission in the – appropriately named – Balz report that the Latvian people do not really want it. You talk in the report about citizens being ‘directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament’. They already are represented by Members they have voted for, but the traditional view of a democratic representative is not good enough for you, is it, Mr Duff? Of course this is not what we really want, is it? What you want, Mr Duff, is for citizens to be represented by people who agree with your own federalist vision of Europe. The people may not want that, Mr Duff, but what does that really matter to you? What we need is a referendum about our membership of the European Union. That is what the people of the United Kingdom want. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, medical practitioners will know the acronym FTT well. It stands for ‘failure to thrive’. The idea of imposing new taxes on European business at a time of economic hardship and rising unemployment has been described as perverse and unacceptable by the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. But this is not an economic decision, is it? This is a political project. Even Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, stated recently that the FTT posed a very real risk to the economy, confirming the observation by Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, that even amongst the 11 Member States that agreed to press forward, there is not unqualified support.  For a financial transaction tax to work, it would have to be global, as its proposer, James Tobin, stated, but do we think for one minute that the G20 would be prepared to follow the lead of the people who inflicted the euro area on the world? Tomorrow we will vote on whether to allow Latvia to buy the last ticket on the Titanic. This tax must never be allowed to set sail. It should be strangled at birth. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I contend that the EU is the sick man of the developed world, as much mentally ill as physically. The EU leaders meet for another late-night supper, then adjourn to the drawing room for their usual game of economic bluff, while quislings put together some incoherent mumbo-jumbo communiqué. The idea of the game is simple: to let all 27 leaders leave with some credibility and be able to say that something has been won for their countries. In the UK we know that the game is EU deception: a game our last eight Prime Ministers have played in Brussels. The real losers are the people of Europe, who pay for this late-night folly. Some ex-players of the game, such as former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, have now said that it is time the UK left the EU. Of course he was rounded on by Europhile business leaders coming out with the usual tripe about UK trade being affected. I wholeheartedly agree with his response on the BBC this week, when he called them economic illiterates. We know about these scaremongering stories; during the single currency debate of the late 1990s, Nissan warned that they would remove their investment from the UK if we did not join the euro. Well, they did not. In fact they invested more.  I suggest a new game for Thursday night called ‘reality’, where Europe’s leaders realise that their beloved Europe federal project has failed and that the single currency is unsustainable without the express consent of the people of Europe to federalising steps, and understand that the people of the UK no longer wish to subsidise your pie-in-the-sky projects whilst they are suffering crippling cut-backs at home. I understand that the best treatment for mental illness is accepting the illness and accepting reality. I commend it to you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is wonderful that Heads of Government and Heads of State come here to set out their agenda, and dialogue is never a bad thing. However, I think there is one notable exception, or rather one person who has not come here who has a lot to say about Europe. That is the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who reckons he can renegotiate, for example, the Social Chapter. Is it not about time that he came to this Chamber and explained what he really meant, so that we, the elected representatives of people across Europe, could see whether the UK actually could renegotiate its terms of membership? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Madam President, many of my colleagues here today have called for one voice for the European Union, indeed one mentioned ambassadors rather than heads of delegation. But surely that needs some type of federalism? The European Union does not have a mandate for that. That is why, in my view, the EEAS is fundamentally flawed. I am sure it is a big problem for Baroness Ashton to carry out her duties when she cannot speak for all 27 nations. But I cannot help the feeling that she is part-author of her own problems. Of course she was leader of the Lords when she pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, when she argued there was no fundamental change of power. And here she is in fact really wanting more power. So which was it, Baroness Ashton? You know, you cannot have it both ways. The only way that the EU can actually speak with one voice is if it gives a mandate from the people. One specific question that I would really like you to answer this afternoon: in what capacity, Baroness Ashton, were you at the Champions League final this year? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, while I welcome this debate about poverty in Europe, I think that using EU funding to tackle domestic poverty issues is highly unfair to the taxpayers of those few countries that actually make significant contributions to the EU budget. In the UK, there is a growing resentment towards those Member States that are seen as being takers. It is deeply regrettable that the UK, with its great tradition of helping those less fortunate than itself, has a growing resentment about funding this or that EU project while British people are suffering crippling cutbacks at home. No wonder more and more people are turning against the European Union. Only last week, the leading philanthropist Bill Gates, a regular visitor to the European Parliament, congratulated the United Kingdom on its remarkable record in foreign aid – a record, incidentally, that the EU likes to piggyback on and take credit for.  This report acknowledges that Member States should take responsibility for issues of poverty and social inclusion, and that the fund for European aid and the most deprived should not be seen as replacing those responsibilities. But what message is being sent out by the call for an increased budget for the fund for 2014-2020? Who will supply this extra money: the 200 000 British citizens who are dependent on food banks in order to feed their families, or the growing army of unemployed youth? The economic crisis, largely the fault of the eurozone, is now so bad that we have to say charity begins at home. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, 1.3 million families – that is one in four families in England – are on lower incomes. They have to spend a third of their net income on housing, largely owing to the shortage of private rental sector housing, which was exacerbated in the 1980s by the Conservative Party’s failure to build social housing programmes and the Labour Party of the 1990s failing to tackle that issue. I am glad that this is a national competence, and it should stay a national competence. However, the EU has a detrimental impact. We currently have a government in the United Kingdom saying that it does not know how many people who will be coming from Romania and Bulgaria, or indeed from across the European Union. How are our local authorities supposed to make provision when current provision does not meet demands? This is why we have problems of people in the private sector not being able to afford housing on a third of their income – some GBP 500 in Coventry. That is not affordable, and we cannot provide this any longer. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, one word: ‘consistency’. I will repeat it again so that the interpreters get it to you in time: ‘consistency’. I have been here four years, and not once have I been told that you have to have the question in before the start of the process. This is the first time this has happened. If this is the case, then you should announce it before the votes even begin. It was my understanding that you had to have your request for a question in before the subject or report was brought up. It is a complete inconsistency, and you are denying me my full mandate by not allowing me my explanation of vote on this report, so I ask you once again to give me my explanation of vote because you are denying me my mandate. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I have heard of the carrot and stick approach, but I have never heard of the carrot and carrot approach. That seems to be the EU’s relationship with Turkey. It seems to give, give, give.  Can I remind this institution that the Cypriots held the Presidency in the latter part of 2012 and Turkey point blank refused to actually have anything to do with them, although they were a candidate country. Well if the candidate country does not want to have anything to do with its Presidency, surely the candidature should be ceased there and then.  The people of Cyprus are held hostage by the invaders and occupiers of northern Cyprus. The people of Morphou last November, together with myself, attempted to visit their town and were refused free access to their old town by the Turkish authorities. The people of Kyrenia wished to celebrate a religious service in their town over the coming Easter and have been refused by the Turkish authorities.  Baroness Ashton is being her usual, useless self and is unable to help. Is it not about time we got real on Turkey? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, first of all I would like to express my agreement with the comment made about the Boston bombing. I send my condolences to the victims and their families, and my best wishes to the injured. Terrorism must not, and will never, succeed. The debate is about the future of the European Union, and I must say that I normally struggle to make my case in a minute, but such a debate is a very short one. What future does it have? Is it like the Soviet empire that had a blatant disregard for its people, which ignores it opinions and fails to give referendums – and when it does, it ignores the result and then calls for other referendums? Does it steal the savings of ordinary people, like it did in Cyprus? Does it disregard an occupying force in North Cyprus, even though it is part of the European Union – which unbelievably has the status of Nobel Prize Winner? Is this the future of the European Union? No. The future of the European Union is doomed. It is doomed to failure. It does not have a democratic mandate. You are frightened of the people. The European Union is failing, and that is why the UK needs to be out of it soon. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, a week ago we lost a great political figure, a woman who achieved the highest office in the land from humble beginnings – in fact, the first elected woman in the western world. Incidentally she achieved that without the need of a quota, something which this House believes so firmly in. When she took office, the United Kingdom was the sick man of Europe, but her strong policies, handling of the economy and dealing with trade unions – a lesson which the French and Germans still have not learnt in thirty years – transformed the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The President, Mr Schultz, called her a great European. She did believe in the membership of the European Community and she signed the Single European Act, but when she realised it was getting into a federal Europe and a single currency she said, ‘No, no, no’, and that is why the cowards stabbed her in the back. From a personal point of view she inspired me into politics. I was ten when she was elected and I met her just three months before I was elected, and when I told her that I was coming here to fight for British independence from the European Union she told me never to give up, never to give up, and I can assure you I will never give up fighting for my country’s independence.

blue-card question
. – 
Mr President, my colleague talks about integrity, but maybe he would like to comment on the integrity of the EU in its last foray into professional football – the Bosman ruling – which I would say has probably caused some of the problem.  What it has done is taken the wealth from a lot of the smaller clubs and transferred it to the bigger clubs and created overpaid footballers, and underpaid footballers at a grassroots level. That is where the people who are involved in organised crime are actually attacking lower paid footballers. It is in the lower leagues that this match-fixing is taking place. The Bosman ruling – an EU ruling – has created that problem. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, this issue is close to my heart, as a lover of sport and a football season-ticket holder and sponsor of football at all levels, including grassroots. It is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Some people like to call it the beautiful game. Clearly, we are learning that football is becoming noticeably more grubby and sullied. According to experts, as many as ten matches a week in Europe are now affected by match-fixing. The numbers of games affected worldwide is astonishing.  However, it is not enough to look at this issue from a purely European perspective. Can we trust the EU Commission, with its history of corruption, to clear up sport? Maybe it is a ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’.  Match-fixing is an endemic problem across the world. Until nations and football authorities get their houses in order, how can we expect anything to change? Take a look at FIFA, for example, a body that has been dogged by accusations of corruption; or the FA back in my own country that fails to implement a working fit-and-proper-persons test, which allows vulnerable clubs to fall into the wrong hands.  Many of the players that get caught up in match-fixing accusations are often poorly paid, poorly educated and poorly protected. It is not enough for Europol to investigate this problem. UEFA has far more member countries than the EU, so proposed EU action would be an irrelevance. It is about time that we had transparent football authorities and legislation from national governments to stamp out this organised crime in football once and for all. I believe football can be beautiful again. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 I voted against this report not because I do not want to decrease the amount of MEPs far from it. I actively campaign for my own redundancy and the other 72 UK MEPs. I voted for the previous defeated amendment to call for the matter to be referred to an Independent body to determine to size and make-up of future parliaments. Politicians should not determine alone how they are to be elected. Also, this report allows for enlargement. Something I am opposed to. The EU cannot deal with itself at the moment let alone getting larger. To those countries that will lose an MEP, they should not worry, when the UK leaves they will have 73 seats to redistribute.

Mr President, once again Europe’s leaders will meet for a late night supper. The agenda may talk of growth and jobs, but we have heard it all before and nothing improves. Only lip service will be paid to jobs and growth. The real conversation over the foie gras will be how to save your beloved political project of European federalisation. The talk will be about how to keep Italy in line after its comical election and how to downplay yet another country, Cyprus, seeking a new bailout. British people know that problems come from Europe and they pay for them with cold, hard cash and the reduction of essential public services. British people are getting more and more fed up with the European Union. May I take this opportunity to thank Mr Barroso for helping with this. Despite Mr Cameron’s attempts to knock a referendum into the long grass, the British people demand a referendum on our membership now. My constituents send a clear message to my office, week in, week out, which is that they do not want anything more to do with this corrupt and doomed mess that is the European Union.

Mr President, in a dispute where up to 70 000 people have been killed and a million refugees have fled the country since the crisis began two years ago, the question must be posed: what good is Baroness Ashton? What is her highly expensive and ineffective EEAS achieving to alleviate the situation? The answer is very little, just typical EU lip-service – or you are an expensive lipstick, Mrs Ashton. Your authority is highly questionable. You represent 27 nations who have different outlooks. You have been heavily criticised here today by members of all political groups. Indeed, Mr Cameron said the UK was still an independent country when threatening to veto an EU extension to the arms embargo. What does that make you? Redundant? The situation in Syria is deplorable. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has today visited a UN refugee camp in Jordan and described the situation as heart-breaking. What will you do? Will you at least begin by putting Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, not a single sane person in this Chamber would disagree with me when I say that the common agricultural policy needs reforming.  The EU needs to reduce intervention to a genuine safety net, move towards a market-orientated approach and the end of a situation whereby farmers chase subsidies and not markets – the old-style CAP market production box marked ‘Failed projects’ it should be confined to.  What reform are we really going to see here? We have been talking about this for two years, and a quarter of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development opposed the report. What message does that send to the farming sector? Both environmentalists and farmers alike are highly critical of the green aspects of these proposals. How then can the public believe that their environmental concerns have been addressed? I believe that the people who are best qualified to look after the British landscape are the British farmers, not unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. The CAP is expensive and over-bureaucratised, and farmers in my constituency constantly contact me about this. It adds to the weekly food bill of every family in Great Britain. Professor Patrick Minford of Cardiff Business School, a leading critic of the CAP, is on record as stating that the average family would be much better off if we left the European Union, not only in terms of cheaper food.

blue-card question
. – 
Mr President, I have a question for my colleague. He has talked about potential national interest and each Member’s country not wanting to lose one. We have also had a slight accusation against my colleague, Mr Duff, that he may be doing it for political purposes. Does this not show that politicians should not determine how politicians are elected? The EU employs far more bureaucrats than necessary. Should it not be done without politicians making these decisions and just determined by independent bodies, as is done in the UK? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, democracy is far from perfect. While I feel that there should be some protection for some smaller countries, I think it is only fair to inform you that my country, the United Kingdom, is greatly under-represented. In fact, I represent a region, the West Midlands, which has some 5 million people. At the last election, six of us were elected, so that was about 900 000 people each.  We have Maltese MEPs and Luxembourgish MEPs, with populations of half a million also returning six MEPs. Now, I make a great effort in communicating with my constituents, but my allowances have to stretch to 5 million people, whereas an MEP from Luxembourg or Malta – with only 500 000 and a much smaller geographical area – is put at great advantage. I do not think that is taken into consideration. (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, this is a rather difficult subject, and I would say at the outset that I do not blame any immigrants who want to try and make a better life for themselves. What I do feel is that the politicians have let down the immigrants and the settled community. In 2004, when the Eastern Bloc countries joined the EU, our Labour Government told us that we would only have 14 000 people coming into the UK. Well, it hit over a million people. How were our local service providers – our National Health Service, our housing – able to plan ahead for that? Next year, we face more people coming from Bulgaria and Romania. How are our social services in the United Kingdom, which are already cut to the bone, and our taxpayers, who are paying more money, supposed to support that? It simply does not work. I am glad to see that our own government is beginning to take a stance on this, but even it cannot tell us how many people are coming next year. That is a fundamental problem with planning for social services in the United Kingdom. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am making a point of order on a point of order. You noticed my point of order previously and as I understand it – and I have taken issue with this once before – when a President notices that a Member wishes to make a point of order, he or she must take that point of order. You acted beyond your responsibilities in not taking my point of order earlier. The point of order was that the Non-Attached element of this House had not made any speech at all and yet you had given the catch-the-eye to groups that had spoken on numerous occasions.

Austerity is detrimental to disabled people (8 % of the UK population), who are finding themselves in a worst position of poverty than ever before. In the UK we have endured constant reassessments of the work capability assessment, which has led to the deaths and suicides of 73 disabled people per week. It is abhorrent that 29 % of the cuts are focused on disabled people. Fewer people are entitled to support from their local authorities, and we will see the introduction of personal independence payments to replace disability living allowance, which is set to knock over half a million people off support. There is also a proposal to close the Independent Living Fund permanently. The proposal by the government is to transfer monies to cash strapped local authorities; which are already saying that they will institutionalise disabled people, to save money. These are just some of the cuts impacting on disabled people in the UK, estimated to take GBP 9 billion from the poorest in society. No wonder British people are sick and tired of the EU. We have a saying ‘Charity begins at home’. Britain needs to look after its vulnerable people and not be hampered by sending GBP 53 million every day to the EU. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I really do have to admit I would love to be a fly on the wall in this Friday’s EU Budget talks in Brussels. I would like to see the discomfort of Mr Cameron as he walks into the room, the tension in his neck at the thought that he has to confront Mr Hollande and his colleagues throughout Europe. He has put referenda back on the agenda and he is going to have to sit down and fight for the British interest. He says he wants a renegotiation, but President Schulz has already told this Parliament that renegotiation is not possible. Mr Verhofstadt told the BBC renegotiation is not possible, so who is going to give? Are they going to be shown to be fools, or is Mr Cameron going to be shown to be a fool? I think Mr Cameron is trying to pull a Houdini act here. He is trying to appease the Eurosceptic majority in the UK, while trying to appease the European Union. This Houdini act is bound to fail and he will be shown to be more like Tommy Cooper.  My constituents tell me they do not want GBP 53 million spent in the EU. That money is better spent at home.

 Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague why she does not think the expenditure in this Parliament is too great. Two years ago the entertainment budget for MEPs or for Parliament went up 80%. Do you not think that was a substantial increase? In December, in the courtyard here in Strasbourg, we saw extortionate expenditure on television screens and posters that are still there about celebrating the Sakharov Prize. In that week each Member of Parliament and each member of staff was given probably five, six or seven pieces of chocolate. Do you not think that was unnecessary expenditure? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I used to go back and tell my constituents that this was the institution that knew no cutbacks. In my first few years as an MEP the allowances just went up and up and up and up. We all got a new member of staff for Lisbon; the attendance allowance went up from EUR 296 to EUR 304 euros. I have already mentioned that the entertainment budget went up 82%; everything just went up and up and up.  As we go towards 2014 you decided to make some minor cutbacks, forgetting what you paid in the first few years. You ignored reality for far too long and now you are wondering what to do. You are making the poor staff here suffer through no fault of their own on account of your political meddling. What about cutting Ms Ashton’s EEAS? What does it actually do? What about cutting that back? What about the shiny new offices for Mr Van Rompuy and Ms Cathy Ashton? And what about the bigger argument as to whether we should be here in Strasbourg? And what about Fridays here in Strasbourg? There are still 80 to 100 MEPs that come here on a Friday morning and sign in and go home when there is no official business. That is about EUR 30 000 month; should that not be cut out for a start? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, corporate social responsibility is a policy concept whereby businesses self-regulate in order to operate in an ethical and sustainable manner in order to understand and meet the needs and expectations of all stakeholders. In this report, however, this concept has been transformed into a jumble of slogans and key words seemingly intended to tick all the right boxes without explaining how exactly anything is to be actually achieved.  The concept of self-regulation has gone from this report and has seemingly been replaced by vague calls for Commission strategies, Commission guidelines, even concrete proposals from the Commission for the implementation of corporate socially responsible practices. The rapporteur – even if now he wants businesses, enterprises, to be responsible for solving social issues caused by the economic crisis – believes that the economic crisis has shaken employees’ faith in corporations to meet their pension obligations. No, Mr Howitt, it is the EU and the eurozone crisis that has done that.  This report flits from subcontracting to low carbon technology and to gender equality in the blink of an eye. The rapporteur calls for the launch of a new EU initiative on advancing materiality. He wants the EU to back a proposal for a UN convention on corporate responsibility. More bureaucracy is the last thing that businesses need at this time. The report refers to short-term thinking in Brussels in one breath and with the next it calls on the Commission to show leadership. It takes a concept based on self-regulation by wide, diverse and economic actions in 27 Member States and seeks to turn it into an EU competence where one size will not fit at all. It reads like a student manifesto, a first-year student manifesto. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, let us rewind a little. Before you roll out your latest grandiose plan, let us take a look back. Do you remember the Lisbon Agenda? Let me refresh your memory. It was adopted for a ten-year period in 2000 by the European Council. It broadly aimed to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. How did that go for you? Not well. You replaced it with another plan. Now your beloved political project is in dire straits. Millions across Europe are in despair, and now you are scurrying around looking for another plan. You cannot accept the political reality that your project is fundamentally flawed. Your foundations are as strong as the blancmange that I had for dessert last night. Whilst the euro sails into the rocks, the three presidents grandstand with the Nobel Prize. Did Nelson Mandela grandstand in the same manner? Did Barack Obama? No. They had dignity, and we are not seeking to create some useful diversion to problems so destructive to the peoples of Europe. No wonder the people of the UK demand a referendum to have their say on this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I would congratulate my colleague on her speech, which was very strong and meaningful. But when she talks about the peace process, would she not agree with me that one of the main barriers to the peace process is Hamas’s refusal to recognise the state of Israel? She failed to mention that at all. That is really the first step towards peace and a two-state solution in this matter. I invite her to call on Hamas to recognise the state of Israel.

– Madam President, is it not deeply ironic in a debate about democracy that this Parliament is using rules to actually stifle debate? We are not allowed to use blue cards or catch-the-eye, which means that very small entities such as the non-attached Members get no speaking time at all. Of course we will all be standing in elections in 2014. You did say at the start of the debate that there would be no catch-the-eye, but you did not say, and it has not previously been put in any of the material or by e-mail, that there would be no blue cards. I think that is a real breach of this debate and shows the EU to be what it is: it talks about democracy but it does not want to let everyone have their say or even their vote. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, my constituents will not be too surprised to learn that their hard-earned money taken by taxes and passed on to the EU is being negligently handed out by the net recipients of the EU budget. In a week when many Member States are seeking an increase in the EU budget to just over EUR one trillion, my constituents in the UK say this is unacceptable in a time of austerity. The blame for the failure to have the audit signed off for the 18th year lies firmly at the door of the unelected bureaucrats of the EU. They have failed the taxpayers of Europe once again. I note that 60 % of the errors found by the Court could have been detected by Member States, yet it is the quagmire of rules and unnecessary complications that is at fault. And what is the EU doing to correct this? It is not even notifying the Member States concerned of the direct problems. One of the examples of the billions wasted is the EUR 700 million to establish the rule of law and reduce corruption in Kosovo, but the results are poor according to the report. Staff delegated were not even sufficiently trained, yet the EU thinks that by throwing in taxpayers’ money without reasonable constraint it can solve the problem. And what about pan-European parties? What about public financing of political parties such as the right-wing extremist parties to which some UKIP Members have signed up, some Nazis – what about the financing of that? A colleague of mine talked about confidence. Well, the people of the UK have less and less confidence in the EU, which is why we need an in-or-out referendum, sooner rather than later. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, I can say with some certainty that, in times of austerity, my constituents do not want their taxes spent on political campaigns and propaganda. I voted against these proposals that seek to further the use of pan-European parties, with all their expense and their ideology of promoting EU federalism. The majority of people in the UK do not share an EU identity. In successive EU elections, people have used the elections to express their disapproval of the EU. Opinion poll after opinion poll shows dissatisfaction with the EU and a wish for a referendum. My constituents do not wish to hear propaganda, paid for by their taxes, telling them how great the EU is. They feel the reality of cutbacks in public services, whilst the UK pays more and more to the EU – a luxury we cannot afford. In 2014 the We Demand a Referendum Party will put on the ballot paper those words, ‘We demand a referendum’. This will allow the electorate from the UK to send you, and our government, a message, loud and clear, that we demand an in-out referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, once again we have a summit that promises a solution but in the fullness of time delivers little but further EU integration. Through the fault of unelected, incompetent Eurocrats and blinded Member State leaders, the financial crisis is being used as a tool for further EU integration. What a heavy price we are paying for the Eurocrats’ fantasy of a United States of Europe. Have they learned nothing from their folly? President Barroso and his apparatchiks care little for the ordinary person. This latest round has been done on the back of the Greek collapse and the 43 % increase in the suicide rate there. My fear is for the UK which, despite being out of the eurozone, is seemingly unaffected. Yet this deal fails to safeguard the City of London and its prosperity. David Cameron has given the green light to banking union and got nothing in return. Why? Was this not the opportunity to renegotiate some of those powers back from the European Union, as Cameron endlessly promises? It shows his words to be empty and that once again we have a Conservative Party which talks tough on Europe, with its sprinkling of Judas goats. But Cameron turns out to be nothing more than the German Chancellor’s poodle. Three out of four Conservative voters want an ‘in or out’ referendum but are being deceived by their leadership, which continues to sleepwalk the UK into a federal Europe. So I call on those Conservative supporters to stand up to David Cameron for the future of your party and for our country. Send him a loud message: we demand a referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I recently spent some time in Cyprus, taking part in anti-occupation events against the illegal Turkish occupation, which has now been going on for 38 years. Turks hold 38 % of Cypriot lands when Cyprus is actually part of the European Union. It was while I was in Cyprus that I learned that the European Union had won the Nobel Peace Prize. That may be a joke, but not for the people of Cyprus. Part of that award was for dispute resolution, but what has the European Union done to help the people of Cyprus? There were 1 619 people missing after the Turkish invasion. Not enough work has been done. Yet Turkey is still a candidate country and does not even recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is an EU Member State. It does not even recognise the Cyprus EU Presidency. What is the European Union doing about this? It is an absolute joke. I call for justice for internal refugees in Cyprus and justice and human rights for the families of the missing people. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, when I listen to Baroness Ashton extolling the great successes of the European External Action Service, I am reminded of the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, where a well-meaning but seriously challenged and naive young man finds himself at the centre of events. He was surrounded by the great and the good, but was never really sure of what was going on. We have seen the faltering and sometimes painful transition to democracy of the long-suffering peoples in the Arab Spring; the ongoing civil war in Syria; fears over nuclear proliferation; the death of Gaddafi; and the return of Putin. These are challenging times in which we are seeing relationships and dynamics redefined. However, at a recent meeting with an exasperated diplomat from the Middle East, he told me that he regarded the High Representative as being more of a hindrance than a help. We all understand that Baroness Ashton drew the short straw. Her role is that of a caretaker of an unformed entity. History is unlikely to remember her in any great detail, but she once found herself elevated to the British House of Lords without ever receiving a single vote in any democratic election. As Forrest Gump pointed out so eloquently, life is like a box of chocolates and we will never know what comes next. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I should like to begin by saying kalimera
, President Christofias. It was a delight to meet you when I came to Nicosia in 2009. Can I pay tribute to your efforts to solve the Cyprus problem; a problem which is way overdue. The ongoing insult given to you by the Turkish Government of not recognising you as the President of Cyprus is something which should be highlighted in this Chamber. I would call on you and the EU to remove the candidate status of Turkey, because they have shown themselves not able to communicate with the European Community. You talk about this as being a bastion of democracy. However, you were educated in Russia and you would have seen how the Duma was no more a bastion of democracy than this place is in relation to the Politburo, which is probably likened to the Commission led by Mr Barroso, who uses this place as a veil of democracy for its actions. You are right to highlight that the problem of your Presidency is the plight of workers. In Athens you will find graffiti that says: let us refuse to live as slaves. Your background and your ideology as a Communist will make this very difficult for you. How are you going to protect the workers or stand up for the workers with the austerity that Angela Merkel and the rest of the European Union is pushing forward? Surely you would agree with me that EU 2020 lacks 20/20 vision? I have no doubt it will be as successful as the Lisbon Strategy, which was meant to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. You said in an interview on television last night not to expect a mountain from Cyprus. Well, the EU is the Everest of all … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question to Ioannis Kasoulides. 
– 
Mr President, I wish to ask the gentleman why he thought the attack on the United Kingdom was warranted. Let me remind him that my country has backed up EUR 10 billion in IMF guarantees to his country. Our forces are stationed on Cyprus, at costs of tens of millions of pounds every year, to safeguard Cyprus. If it was not for British forces I think that Turkey would have gone a long way further in 1974. But has this place moved on? I thought this place was about the future. What about the Austro-Hungarian Empire? What about Italian colonialism? What about French colonialism? What about Portuguese colonialism? What about German expansion? Are you moving on or do you want to be part of the past? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, many of my constituents have contacted me regarding being disadvantaged by an uneven playing field in the direct payments and CAP in general. Direct payments, or direct subsidies to farmers, account for three quarters of the CAP budget, which, of course, is 48% of the EU budget, so it is quite a considerable amount of money. However, the Conservative-led British Government is reluctant to make use of some of those discretionary funds that are available to support our farmers. In fact, they are increasing the uneven playing field by wishing to voluntarily reduce direct payments faster than any other Member State, which is why I will be voting against Amendments 1 to 12 and 13. The struggles of UK farmers are compounded by the Commission’s ongoing use of the historical distribution key to allocate Pillar 2 funds between Member States. This discrimination against the UK primarily needs to stop. We need a fairer allocation of Pillar 2 farmers and to protect our farmers in the UK. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, this act purports, via a package of measures, to boost assistance for small and medium businesses yet I fear, once again, it is nothing more than comforting words to give the appearance of action. The reality is that the European Union is part of the problem, not the solution. Europhiles like Malcolm Harbour tell us that Britain’s future depends on membership of the European Union, that more than half of our trade is with the EU. These are disingenuous arguments. Eighty percent of UK trade is internal, with 50% of the rest being with the EU. That is only 10% of UK trade, for which we have had a deficit since the early 1970s. Yet the EU and its bureaucratic rules and regulations are draining the life out of small and medium enterprises. No wonder the Federation of Small Businesses said to prospective MEPs in the 2009 European election guide, please, no more EU regulations. Malcolm Harbour attended a dinner, as I did. Commissioner Barnier, there are 4.5 million small businesses in the UK that account for 99% of all enterprise. That is almost 60% of private sector employment and almost 50% of private sector turnover. SMEs employ an estimated 13.8 million people and have an estimated combined annual turnover of GBP 1 500 billion. The EU has constantly negatively impacted on their ability to service the majority of their contracts, whilst making it easier for other EU countries to trade in the UK. No wonder eight out of ten people want a referendum on Britain’s membership of this corrupt and doomed mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, while I am opposed to this institution, I welcome any forum to discuss an issue that is so repugnant. Worldwide, it is estimated that well over 120 million women will be subjected to female genital mutilation. The aim of the process is to ensure that the woman is faithful to her future husband. Some communities consider girls ineligible for marriage if they have not been circumcised. How can you use religion and cultural tradition to excuse child abuse? It has been reported that girls as young as three undergo this process. Member States must tackle, and take a lead in combating, this despicable crime. Where the crime takes place in a Member State, strong custodial sentences must be passed. When aid is provided to countries where this is prevalent, conditions must be put in place to send a clear message that this practice must stop. Thankfully, due to health campaigns, female circumcision has been falling in some countries in the last decade. These involve a week-long programme of community education about the negative effects of female genital mutilation, culminating in a coming of age ceremony for young women. The young women are secluded for a week and undergo classes on reproduction, anatomy, hygiene, respect for adults, developing self-esteem and dealing with peer pressure. All of us here must do whatever we can to stop this barbarism. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, this issue stems from the failure of the French authorities to regulate its manufacturing industry. Typically, ‘France has a take it or leave it’ approach to regulations that it expects other countries to adopt. In June 2000, US medical regulators posted a warning letter on the Internet about problems at a breast implant maker in southern France. The French authorities did not pay this much attention. The French health authorities acknowledged as much in a 175-page report published on 1 February this year. Radical change is needed in Europe to ensure proper surveillance of medical devices. France has shown itself incapable of regulating itself and should have external checks. Many thousands of women have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, because of French negligence. France should be made to compensate all women affected by this negligence. In future, there needs to be more communication with the surgeons, the clinics and the patients. These companies must be checked and the findings should be open to inspection by health professionals. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Madam President, I would be interested to know what my colleague feels about Mr Howitt’s response. Not only was Mr Howitt rude by not turning up at his allotted speaking time, but he actually did not answer the question at all. If this Chamber had any credibility, these blue-card questions would be respected. Mr Howitt was asked a question after he said that he did not agree with political appointments; he was asked what he thought of Ms Ashton’s appointment, which was political. What does my colleague think about Mr Howitt’s reply? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, first of all, I did actually ask a question. If I used the words ‘does my colleague agree with me’, that usually begins a question. Now for my speech. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson institutionalised the concept of human rights in the US Declaration of Independence, and today’s US Ambassadors around the world have the responsibility for projecting that concept wherever they may be. In my country, Great Britain, human rights matters come under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, but these models are apparently not good enough for the European Union. The rapporteur calls for a Special Representative for this policy area, complete with his or her budget lines and dedicated staff. It is not, of course, within the realm of possibility that the existing EU overseas delegations could shoulder this responsibility. Might that eat into their four-day weeks and prolonged holiday entitlements? There are incidentally 119 such delegations. Surely, at a time of EU-enforced austerity, in situ apparatus should be used, rather than creating new, expensive departments. One aspect of the report I do agree with is that if a Special Representative for Human Rights should be appointed, they should have the necessary professional qualifications, extensive experience and a proven track record in the field of human rights, as well as personal and professional integrity and an international reputation. The High Representative may feel a little embarrassed at this valid point as these criteria were clearly overlooked in her appointment. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, the ever-growing figure of youth unemployment results from the selfishness of today’s politicians abandoning tomorrow’s prospects. In the UK, there has been a 43% increase in the number of young people aged 18 to 24 who have not had a job for more than two years. It would seem that some have given up on looking for work and are becoming increasingly detached from society. The youth unemployment crisis can be beaten only if job creation for young people becomes a key priority in policy making and private sector investment picks up significantly. My concern is that the EU is far too rigid in its general approach to law making to be of any real assistance to our young people. Yes, you might point to this scheme or that scheme, but the bureaucracy to apply for support is so disproportionate to the assistance required that it becomes self-defeating. The UK needs to offer tax breaks and other incentives to businesses hiring young people and offering more entrepreneurship programmes to help kick-start careers. EU, you are part of the problem, not the solution. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, we have heard a lot of fine words today about small businesses being the backbone of society and our economy, etc., etc., but what about the reality? I am reminded that President De Gaulle scoffed at the English and called us a nation of shopkeepers. But, Mr President, it is our small businesses and our shopkeepers that employ the vast majority of the workforce in the United Kingdom. In my mobile surgery, that goes around every town and city in the West Midlands on a regular basis, I meet shopkeepers who say they are being strangled by European Union regulation; business rates are too high; there is not enough training; there is not enough access to finance. Yet all they hear of, all the time, is more EU funds – the UK being the second largest contributor to the EU but having few recipients of aid and training. Take the European Globalisation Fund: every other country in the EU has had access to this fund except the United Kingdom. This is pertinent in Ryton, near Coventry, where Peugeot closed down in 2005. It also closed plant in France, but the French got training and the people of Coventry did not. Then there are these ‘JEREMIE’ funds, providing funding for small businesses around Europe, including in the south of France – a country that is a member of the G8. Is there any in the UK? No, there is not. Absolutely disgraceful! As I said, we are the second largest contributor to the European Union; we need to cut out the middle man, fund our own small businesses and leave the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, our youth’s prospects are dying of bureaucracy and its weapon of choice, red tape. Youth unemployment is a scourge that will affect Europeans for generations. People who suffer unemployment in their early years subsequently tend to earn much less. They suffer deterioration of skills and future job instability. In Spain, a staggering 46.4% of young people are out of work. Is it any coincidence that the states with the worst problems are members of the eurozone? The OECD has stated that the eurozone crisis is the biggest single threat to global recovery. The eurozone 17 will see their economy shrink by 1.9% this year. In contrast, both the UK and the US economies will grow. More than one in five young people across the European Union as a whole are unemployed and figures released yesterday by the UN suggest that this is set to get worse. UK businesses, both small and large, are crying out for less bureaucracy. Tomorrow, EU leaders will meet in Brussels to discuss jobs and growth. We can expect a self-congratulatory press release and a nice photograph, but we know by now what will happen. Good money will be thrown after bad. Nothing will change and, instead of stemming the red tape that kills jobs, the strangulation will continue. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, as an openly gay person myself, I agree with virtually everything that has been said in this Chamber this afternoon, except probably Mr Posselt’s speech. My concern, however, is that we have heard all these grand words condemning homophobia here, but what about practising what you preach? I have been the victim of two homophobic incidents since I have been a member of this Chamber, and Parliament simply has not bothered to act. If you are going to tell other countries, especially third countries, what to do, at least first practise what you preach. Fortunately, as Baroness Ludford has said, I live in a country that has been reported to be one of the best places – or the best place – in the world to be gay. I count myself quite fortunate. Unfortunately, there are many other people in the world who cannot say the same thing. Yet there is a football tournament on our doorstep in Ukraine – which will be held jointly with Poland – and many Members of this House will be travelling to Ukraine as representatives of some organisation or other, or representatives of the European Union, while today, the UK Foreign Office has put a warning out to gay people to be careful travelling to Ukraine. Why should a single member of this House or the European Union go to Ukraine? Should the European Union as a whole not be boycotting the tournament if that country cannot protect citizens? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I have lost count. Is this the 17th year in which the auditors have failed to give a positive declaration on the EU’s budget or, in other words, have we now reached 17 years in which taxpayers’ money has not been properly accounted for? I note the statement in the resolution on the discharge of the Commission budget that progress has been made since the resignation of the Santer Commission, but I have to ask: ‘Really?’ In 2008, Commissioner Mandelson was accused of a conflict of interest after holidaying with a Russian oligarch whose company subsequently benefited from his department’s decisions. In June 2011, Commission President Barroso ran up a EUR 25 000 hotel bill for a four-night luxury stay in New York. Then there was the Commission memo issued by DG Trade in 2009 which encouraged officials to conceal information from public scrutiny. The EU and its institutions have failed to practise what they preach and what places them above the citizens they purport to represent. It is time the UK left this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, my colleague Mr Fox alluded to the fact that there are already 27 signatories to the Convention and that this would just be a pruning exercise – or rather a preening exercise – by the European Union. Would he not agree with me that this is a further stage of federalisation and that in the 2010 Conservative manifesto it was stated that it would repeal the Human Rights Act, which was brought in by the Labour Party? Now, if this was actually signed, it would mean that they would not have the power to do so. Is this not another massive transference of sovereignty that his party will allow to happen?

Madam President, as a MEP I deal with constituency issues on a daily basis: issues where EU law affects people’s daily lives, either directly or indirectly. I am here to tell you that there is one deeply flawed law that, above all others, damages British life and puts our lives in daily peril. It is the Human Rights Act. It is a rotten law that Britain loathes. Human rights are worth protecting, and I am vocal in the protection of human rights. The Human Rights Act, however, was created in Britain by the Labour Party, which, despite warnings, was reckless as to the consequences. However, this EU-backed – and soon to be enshrined – law is now routinely and regularly abused by those who can cause havoc in civil society. Terrorists, criminals and illegal immigrants, with and without cats. More often than not, judges who apply human rights law decide that those rights trump those of the majority: decent, honest, hard-working British people. The case of Abu Qatada is attracting media attention. The human rights law, by allowing Abu Qatada to dodge deportation to Jordan, has inflamed the British public. Simply, the Court of Human Rights leaves Britain unable to defend its interests. In a recent survey, 75% of British people said they think that the act should be scrapped altogether. It is the Treaty of Lisbon that allows the EU to sign up to the ECHR, which further imprisons the British public, who never got a chance to say no through a referendum. Let me tell you, the British public are shouting aloud: ‘No to the human rights law! Release us from these shackles’.

Madam President, not as big a sigh of relief as the British public would! Yes, Mr Cashman, I agree with you. The Convention on Human Rights was actually written by British lawyers in the early 1950s. It was the Labour Party that signed the Human Rights Act, which enshrined it in British law. That was in 1998. What it actually did was to empower every court, from the most minute up to the Supreme Court (no longer the House of Lords), to apply these human rights, and the judges have taken political jurisprudence. They have not gone along with the public or the elected government. That has to be wrong. In a democracy it should be the will of the people that reigns supreme. If you talk about human rights, Mr Cashman, I want to point out one Labour politician, our High Representative Catherine Ashton – a Labour Party card-carrying member – who refused to do anything about the corrective rape of lesbians in Palestine. That is a disgrace. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I welcome the international dialogue at the conference this week in Marseille. It is imperative that all decision-makers, from local governments through to Member States and the UN, promote initiatives for water quality, availability and affordability. Water is a common good and a human essential, and it is also a human right which should not be used for excessive commercial profit. With this in mind, the fact the Forum’s President, Louis Fauchon, has a foot in both camps is deeply troubling. Member States must give farmers incentives to increase investment in on-farm water storage capacity, which takes up as much as 70% of natural water supply, although the UK National Farmers Union has warned that there is no quick fix. I am also dismayed that in this year of CAP reform – as has been mentioned here by one of my colleagues – there is no mention of this matter. Is this a question of the EU talking with one head and then not talking with the other? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr Howitt, you mentioned two things which I want to bring together: Gaza and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. Would you agree with me and criticise the High Representative for her failure to tackle the issue of corrective rapes of lesbians in Palestine, and also police brutality against LGBT people in Palestine? I visited Gaza and Palestine in November last year. This is evidently a problem that the EU ignores, but it still funds Palestine and it is afraid to tackle this problem on cultural grounds. Would you criticise them for that? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, amongst the items on the agenda at the forthcoming UN Human Rights Council will be Cyprus. I would like to concentrate on human rights issues in Northern Cyprus and their place in negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In Northern Cyprus itself, there have been reports of violations of the human rights and freedom from discrimination of minorities, torture, and violations of freedom of movement, religion and speech. In 1974, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the city of Famagusta was overrun by armour, and the civilian population – fearing massacre – was forced to evacuate, leaving behind everything they could not carry. Only Turks were allowed to remain, and the Varosha section of the city remains isolated and unpopulated to this day. This is in contradiction with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789. Technically, this border dispute does call into question the legitimacy of the Cypriot accession to the European Union. A 112-mile long ‘green line’ still divides the island. 1 588 Greek Cypriots are still on the missing persons list following the Turkish invasion, but still the EU – with the exception of one or two Member States –pushes for Turkey’s accession. By discussing Turkey’s accession whilst unresolved border issues and questions of human rights in Northern Cyprus remain, the EU is undermining the integrity of the United Nations. You are overlooking appalling human rights abuses, and you are making a mockery of the integrity of your own position on human rights. Regarding Turkey’s statement that they would freeze EU ties when Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency, I would ask the High Representative: why is the EU negotiating membership with a country that is acting in such a bullying manner? Although, on second thoughts, the High Representative might agree that such a country would fit perfectly into the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I would like to give my thanks and congratulations to Mr Vaughan for this report as well as my commendation to him for becoming the King Canute of the 21st century, although King Canute would have had a much easier task in stemming the sea than the task of stemming the tide of EU expenditure. In the middle of an economic and financial crisis and ongoing national budget and consolidation efforts, the EU just does not want to see sense. It does not want to actually reverse expenditure but wants a freeze on inflation, which is probably still an increase. What we actually need is to withdraw expenditure and save taxpayers’ money. It needs to be by independent assessment. You have the daily allowances of EUR 304 and there will be a significant number of MEPs – and some MEPs I see in this place right now – who sign in on a Friday in Strasbourg when there is no official business, stealing taxpayers’ money. That should stop. Office allowances are only required to be 50% receipted. That should be 90% receipted and they should be independently audited, as mine is independently audited. If that money is not properly spent, it should be returned. The House of History is a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money that should be stopped. End this extravagance and return taxpayers’ money. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, on a point of order, in the previous debates on human rights, I had a timed speech and I also had a blue card, but you refused me a second blue card. But we had the previous speaker who had a timed speech and a blue card, and you also gave him a catch-the-eye. I would also note that the PPE Group here has had several catch-the-eye speakers, even though I was the very first person to make a request. You need to have equality here. If you talk about equality and democracy, at least give some pretence of it in this Chamber. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I am pleased to support any initiative that empowers and enables physically disadvantaged people, in this case, the blind and partially sighted. The EU has been, in my opinion, insensitive to the needs of millions of blind and partially-sighted people. All Member States and relevant institutions should make the strongest possible representations to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva in June for a full, binding treaty. This is the best way to ensure the fundamental right to read that is currently denied to far too many – apparently 300 million worldwide. Put an end to this famine. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I have a question for my colleague, a Danish Member, about the European financial transaction tax, which the Danish Prime Minister says they want to introduce very swiftly. Does he agree with the Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, Margrethe Vestager, who said it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, or maybe he may agree with Lene Espersen, the former Danish Foreign Minister, who described the tax as ‘bullshit’? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, the Prime Minister is taking on the Presidency of the EU at a time when unacceptable behaviour threatens democratic principles. Such behaviour has become endemic and institutionalised in the European Union. In recent months we have seen elected leaders being bullied out of office and replaced by unelected technocrats, by an over-dominant German leader and her French poodle. With a possible new treaty on the way, the EU apparatchiks are desperately looking for a new way to include all 27 countries without the need for a referendum. So much for democracy. No wonder people across Europe are rioting. The message is there for all to see, but the EU turns its head away. Prime Minister, you again hold the Presidency at a decisive moment: the possible demise of the euro. At a time of crisis and uncertainty the EU is looking to the Danish Presidency for a strong lead. How telling it is that a country from outside the eurozone is taking the helm. The EU is looking to the IMF to help bail out the troubled euro. How telling it is that the UK, a country from outside the eurozone, ridiculed and threatened here in December, has been asked to prop up the IMF at this time. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, it has come to my attention that there is an increasing trend with regard to written declarations in this Parliament for children to be used. Could the President investigate and inform me what the legal situation is, whether they are paid or unpaid, and, more importantly, the insurance situation as to their welfare? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, I have grave concerns about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and I voted against this report. I have looked at the history of this report and noticed that the French car firms in particular, both Renault and Peugeot, as well as Dutch companies and German companies are great recipients of this for people they have made redundant. I am minded of my own constituents in Coventry, the Peugeot Ryton plant, where over 2 000 people were made redundant in 2007 without receiving any assistance or training whatsover. Indeed the Labour government or the current Conservative-led government in the UK has made no claims or put anything into retraining these people or other people whatsoever. There was also this week an EGF in favour of the Südtirol region of Italy, where the Member here, Mr Dorfmann, says that unemployment is just 3%. Yet we gave EUR 3.9 million to that project. Why? Why are we not training people where we do have serious unemployment but just throwing money away to a region where unemployment is only 3%? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, you, I and the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, are, according to Ms Sargentini, from the ‘plus one’. Well, let us hope that is ‘minus one’, and according to most of this Chamber, you will probably be most happy. I welcome the strong approach taken in this report; it is right and proper that transparency is given its correct importance. I am unsurprised by Mr Cashman wanting this because for the pro-Europeans in the UK, it is becoming a much more difficult job trying to sell the European Union and the secrecy of the European Union: its unaudited accounts or unsuccessfully audited accounts have, for many years, been a difficult sell within the UK. Something will need to be done. I would point out that it was the Labour government who brought in the Freedom of Information Act in 1997 in the UK and it ultimately caused them a lot of problems. I am unsurprised that they are hoping to put the Conservative Party in a difficult position in the Council, although they were very disingenuous when they were in power. I do sound a note of caution though on what I hear from the Commission, which is that they have no intention of being transparent, nor does the EPP when they are talking about undermining institutions and about a legitimate report. Who will decide what a legitimate report is? They will never allow transparency because they do not want it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague, who mentions the deplorable conditions in some EU detention centres, whether she would join my colleague, the Earl of Dartmouth, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Today, we have applauded with a standing ovation the Sakharov Prize. How can we talk about human rights in one vein, and be very sanctimonious and supportive of it, when, in the European Union itself, we have detention standards that are below common decency for human beings? Will she join me, and everyone else, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, I think Mr Murphy has summed this up perfectly; he talks about words and actions and that is what lies before us here. That is the decision that we have to make, or the Commission has to make. This is a question of values and puts into sharp focus Baroness Ashton’s assertion yesterday that human rights will be a thread in all the EU does. As has been said many times here, Uzbekistan is the third largest exporter of cotton worldwide; almost half that cotton is picked by state-sponsored forced child labour. Children suffer appalling conditions during the cotton harvest. Many contract hepatitis from insanitary conditions, and there have even been reports of police throwing stones at children who were not picking cotton because they were sick. So far, the European Union has failed to take action on this issue, but it is clear from all parts of this Chamber that this is an issue of importance that needs immediate attention. I would like to see a plan from the Commission, not rhetoric. Suspension of GSP would be a good start. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, I sympathise with my Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues. They are right that there is no European consistency or social cohesion in this matter, but this is a flaw within the EU. Yes, there is discrimination, but fairness has different sides. My constituency of the West Midlands in the UK – and the UK has been mentioned, along with the Netherlands, as one of the countries that wants to prolong this exclusion – has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. We need to provide jobs for those people. When the first wave of Eastern bloc countries joined the European Union, the UK was one of the very few countries that did not impose restrictions, and the then Labour government said that 14 000 people from Poland and elsewhere would come into the UK. That 14 000 turned into over 850 000. That put an extreme demand on our social services: on our social housing, on our National Health Service and on our social security. The British taxpayer simply could not afford it. Earlier today, we heard the United Kingdom being called ‘26 plus one’. Well, it has the right to defend its own borders and to defend its own economy. We will remain that ‘plus one’ and, hopefully, will soon not even be that ‘plus one’ and will be leaving. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card answer. 
– Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Vigenin for his question. Yes, of course, they are taxpayers, but what we are talking about here is the fact that, while they were paying tax, there was a British person who was unemployed because that job was taken, so that was a strain on our social security system. The United Kingdom is, simply, a small island. It is not about race, it is about space: we simply do not have enough jobs. I would like to see a points system in the United Kingdom, whereby we have people from outside the European Union and people from within the European Union as well, so that we can fill the vacancies we actually have. There is no point bringing workers in from around the European Union when we simply do not have the jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card answer. 
– Madam President, I do not have the statistics to hand but I have read several reports since 2005 and it is there for people to see in the United Kingdom. We can see this. We could see in 2006 and 2007 the demand on social housing, the demand on our health service and the demand on social security. Child benefit is paid for every child in the UK, and there were examples of workers from Eastern bloc countries claiming this money for children still resident in the Eastern bloc. That was the demand on British taxpayers. There is obviously an economic benefit from migrant workers to the UK. The UK has benefited from migration since the Second World War, from our own old Empire and Commonwealth countries. We need a certain level of immigration, but it needs to be controlled immigration under our terms, not your terms. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Ms Ţicău, you mentioned that we are either in this or out of this, but the Treaty of Rome actually says that for any kind of changes, especially to any Treaties, you need unanimity. But the European Union changes the rules as it goes along do you not? The British Prime Minister vetoed a new treaty last week, but you are going ahead with the rest of the 26 of you. Where does unanimity come in there? There are rules when they suit you and rules when they do not suit you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I was in Afghanistan less than three weeks’ ago, in Helmand Province, visiting the British forces that are part of the International Security Assistance Force or ISAF. It is an interesting situation there, and there are many fears for post-2014, but since the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, there has been a 60% increase in health care provision, with infant mortality reduced by 20%. Education has increased – obviously including females – with 13 000 more schools, 170 000 more teachers and 7.3 million more students. These are things that we need to build on. I am glad – amazed actually – that the European Parliament is having this debate here tonight and actually showing some concern about where the money goes. This makes a welcome change from previous years. We must continue to help Afghanistan build, because it was a factory of terrorism. The UK, other Member States and the international community need to show faith with Afghanistan to build a strong and prosperous country that rejects terrorism and all the disasters that go with it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, Mr Cameron stated in Westminster yesterday that only two options confronted him at last week’s summit: a new treaty without the negotiated safeguards for Britain or no treaty at all. He rightly chose no treaty. But with this failure, he left his and the Conservative Party’s EU policy in tatters. He mistakenly and naively promised the British people that he could repatriate powers from the EU, and that he could safeguard British interests. But such negotiations are not possible with the European Union, a Union that blatantly and negligently disregards sensible economic rules. You even broke your own rules in the Maastricht criteria just so that your beloved political project of European federalisation could move one step further. In your negligent actions, you cause financial hardship for people across Europe, people you constantly ignore in referendums. You deny them even the opportunity to have their say. To protect our interests, my country was right not to go along with your economic negligence. Even Ms Harms said that the summit denied reality and denied democracy. The British Prime Minister, having had his electoral pledge on renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU undermined and discredited, has finally faced up to the inevitable by refusing to have any part in the latest doomed rescue plan. Mr Cameron’s EU policy of negotiation is now in tatters and only a referendum on Britain’s future membership of the EU is a viable solution. Democratic integrity demands nothing less. The British people demand nothing less. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, as Ms Willmott knows, I am no big fan of Mr Cameron, but I think it is very disingenuous for a Labour politician to come here after 13 years of a Labour government where you deceived and distorted the European issue to the British people. You promised referendum after referendum but you failed to deliver one and called it whatever you wanted in order not to have it. I think Mr Cameron has to deal with the mess of 13 years of Labour policy towards the EU. But here is my question. You mentioned about the Labour Party supporting the European Union but we have a party in government, the Liberal Democrats, that is actually currently supporting the Conservatives. Will you then call for the Liberal Democrats to withdraw from the coalition and force a general election so that we can have a proper debate on the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I rise under Rule 173. I wonder, do you share my concern at the level of xenophobia that was experienced in this Chamber this morning towards Britain? It is an absolute disgrace. A chair of a group, Mr Verhofstadt, and I quote, said, ‘when you are invited to dinner, you are either invited as a guest or as a main course’. Could he explain whether that was a threat and what did he mean exactly by that comment? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the title ‘Fourth Railway Package’ really says it all for me, and that is that the EU is just no good at overseeing the railways of Europe.  UKIP, my party, has been voting against this so-called harmonisation for 15 years now, because we know it is difficult in the UK. We have a Victorian network, the oldest in the world, but quite why Brussels needs to harmonise the trains of the UK, which is an island, with the rest of the continent, is anyone’s guess. HS1 and the Channel Tunnel were financial disasters, with shares crashing and people losing huge amounts of money. But now we have HS2, because the European Union tells us we have to do so.  In 2002 the EU took the British Government to court because we were failing to fulfil our obligations under the Trans-European rail system Directive and now we have High Speed Rail 2 (HS2). The EU-sponsored HS2 will be costly, pointless and unfair, because it will punish the many to benefit the few, and I guarantee that those few will be the rich few.  If HS2 were such a good idea, then the business community would come up with the money, but of course they will not because they know it is just another expensive EU vanity project. Therefore the bill for this drive for harmonisation will fall on the British taxpayer and that, I believe – and my party believes – is grossly unfair, unneeded, unwanted, and that is why we are committed to scrapping HS2.

 Mr President, late last year, I brought up in this Chamber the case of a British ski instructor called Simon Butler. Mr Butler is trying to ply his trade in France at the moment, but he is being hounded by the French authorities, who claim that his qualifications do not meet their requirements, which is blatantly untrue and they know it.  I finished my speech by asking for a meeting with Commissioner Barnier to clear up this matter, which he kindly agreed to. On 20 January, Mr Butler and I met the Commissioner, and Mr Butler now has a memorandum of understanding from Commissioner Barnier, which should mean that he can ply his trade without trouble, without problems and without being harangued and harassed by the French authorities. So you can understand why we were a bit shocked last week when Mr Butler was locked up in a cell for 36 hours for absolutely no reason. It just goes to show that it is a farce. We in Britain stick to the rules and we comply with the single market, but the French do not. It is a disgrace. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, for the first time in my life I must congratulate the rapporteur. I know that this seems surreal coming from a member of UKIP, but I really do think that my British colleague is on to something here. Work permits, rights of residence: seems perfectly good stuff to me. In fact it sounds like the UKIP manifesto. However, where the report falls down is that these sensible proposals only apply to third-country nationals who want to come to the EU for seasonal work.  My proposal is that it should apply to all citizens within the EU but, sadly, EU freedom of movement, which is supported by all the British political parties except my own, prevents this from happening. At the moment in the UK we have 2.4 million people unemployed. That is less than some of the other countries within the EU, but it is still an appalling statistic. Indeed, worryingly, we have 20% youth unemployment and in some parts of my constituency, such as Salford, it is running at up to 40%. Many of these young people cannot find jobs because the employment market has been saturated by a huge influx of Eastern European workers who are prepared to work for less money.   The way to solve this problem is by applying Mr Moraes’ report to the whole of the EU, and then we can get back to controlling our own borders. But of course his own party, the Labour Party, would never support this. The European elections which are coming later this year are going to be dominated by the issue of immigration, and I am happy to say that my party, UKIP, is the only political party in Britain which has a firm, but fair, sensible policy in this area. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, the civil protection mechanism means in effect civil protection money, but the European Union does not have any money; it belongs to the nation states. What the EU is doing is taking money from Member States and then handing it back, repackaged as the European Union. This is taking with one hand and giving with the other. It is little more than kidology. This is a desperate effort to get the citizens of Europe to love the European Union at a time when its popularity has hit rock bottom.  I am not opposed to helping out people who need help in times of natural disasters – fires, floods and earthquakes can completely wreck societies. We have seen this recently in the Philippines, where the aid has come in. Look at what the British have done: the UK Government has given GBP 60 million, provided planes, helicopters and ships, and the British people have provided GBP 70 million in donations. So this is proof that we already give aid when natural disasters occur. What we do not have to do is to filter it through the European Union for the EU to use as propaganda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, well we have finally made it, haven’t we? Agonising negotiations, budget cuts, budgets rises, tears, tantrums and vetoes that never were. So what are we left with? Well, we are left in the UK with us paying GBP 53 million a day into an organisation that has not had its accounts signed off for 19 years! So no change there then.  The EU has even tried to hide the bad press. Mr Van Rompuy threatened the Court of Auditors to give the accounts a clean bill of health. But even then there were more errors, so that means even more taxpayers’ money lost for ever. Last month we had an emergency vote to raise EUR 2.7 billion or, we were told, the EU would shut down like the USA. Of course, our friends the Conservatives did not even have the bottle to vote against this, and abstained, in another stunning victory for Mr Cameron: whilst we have cuts at home, more money for the European Union.  Do not be fooled by this agreement: it is merely papering over the cracks. Because next year the dam will burst at the European elections and in my country UKIP will be riding on the crest of an anti-EU wave. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, we frequently hear that the EU gives us the right to live and work in other countries, but allow me to tell you about Simon Butler, a British ski instructor who was arrested, handcuffed, and dragged off the slopes in front of his class as if he were a common criminal. Had he committed a crime? No. His only crime was that the French did not think his qualifications were good enough. We are talking about a man who easily qualifies as a UK instructor, so why were his qualifications not recognised? This is unfair. We are not talking about a criminal: we are talking about a law-abiding citizen whom the French ski and police authorities clearly want to victimise. I have asked Commissioner Barnier to meet me and discuss this issue and I await his response. Paul Nuttall,

Mr President, unlike many people in this Chamber I have actually been to a Roma camp in Bulgaria. That is me in a place called Fakulteta, which has up to 50 000 people living in slums in a square mile. And I saw conditions there of poverty and deprivation that one rarely sees outside sub-Saharan Africa. If I were forced to live like this, and you were forced to live this, you would seize any chance to leave, and that is what many will do on 1 January next year and many will be headed to the UK.  Some are coming to do honest work, we know that, but some will not. Sadly there are gangmasters within the Roma community who force children to work as everything such as pickpockets and prostitutes. This is already happening in other European countries and in January it will happen in the UK as well. So, centuries after social reformers in Britain stopped child prostitution and put a stop to Dickensian pickpocket gangs, the EU will foist them upon us once again.  There will be a backlash, trust me, and our government will not and cannot do anything about it because of the European Union’s laws. The best way, I believe, to help these people is not to export them round Europe: it is for their own national governments to do what our people did a long time ago and take the fight to child abusers who force them to work as career criminals.

Of course I think this obligation is completely wrong. We have 22 % of our own young people in the UK out of work. That is a million people unemployed. All that will happen when we open up the borders on 1 January 2014 to 29 million more people is that they will saturate the job market. It is about economics, it is nothing to do with racism and, quite frankly, we are only a small island and we cannot cope as it is. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -   
Madam President, I think the last debate on the subject of the Roma people really sums up why we are in the situation whereby extremism is on the march. People like the unelected Commissioner here just live on another planet. They are out of touch with public opinion. Your two flagship policies – the single currency and open borders – are creating a perfect breeding ground for the far right. Take Greece for example. The result of them being trapped in a catastrophic currency union has led to the rise of Golden Dawn. The austerity measures imposed by the European Union have driven large numbers of people in the cradle of democracy into the arms of extremists. Yet you still do not listen. If you want to know why the far right are on the march right across Europe, Commissioner, you have to do nothing else but look in the mirror. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, usually when I get up and criticise EU directives I can see a logic to them. It is usually a twisted and bad logic, but there is still a logic. There are a number of areas in this report which I believe actually defy logic. Firstly, the banning of tens. To me it makes no sense. You are not going to stop people smoking by banning 10 cigarettes. What you are going to do is encourage them to buy 20. So in effect what we are doing is, we are criticising places like McDonalds for supersizing their product but we are encouraging the tobacco industry to do the same. And all it will do is make poor people poorer. As regards the menthol cigarettes issue, a million people in the UK smoke menthol cigarettes. They are not going to stop overnight if you ban them, they will go to conventional cigarettes and you will increase the size of the black market.  Finally, e-cigarettes: e-cigarettes are proving, according to latest research, to be the most effective way of stopping people from smoking. Therefore, why on earth would you make them medicinal? Why would you make it harder to stop people smoking? I would ask my colleagues please to vote against this. It is ill-thought out, it is counterproductive and it is contradictory. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, this Directive might sound dull, but it boasts that it is the jewel in the crown of EU environmental policy. Now if any phrase should send a shiver down everyone’s spine, it’s that. It is massive. It rules 200 types of projects – everything from building bridges to new motorways, to rearing pigs and rearing poultry – and, strangely, the same document also admits that it gives rise to a large number of disputes. Well, that is not surprising because who among us really enjoys red tape when it gets in the way of our own lives?  Now it is the turn of shale gas. Everything must be regulated and nothing must escape. Well, in the North-West of England, we are sitting on possibly the biggest deposits of shale in the whole of Europe and all we want is to be left alone to move on and frack, to produce shale, as what it will do is give us cheap energy and a boom in jobs. Paul Nuttall,

 Madam President, in southern Europe we hear horror stories of 60% youth unemployment in Greece and Spain. In my own country we have a million young people out of work. Why is this happening? It is happening because EU rules and regulations on employers are making it difficult and expensive for them to hire young people. That is one point, but let us talk about the real elephant in the room here. The other problem is the fact that we have been forced to open our borders to 500 million people across the European Union. They have every right to come and work in the UK, to undercut young people and drive down wages. In a few months’ time, on 1 January 2014, we will be opening our borders to 29 million more people from Romania and Bulgaria, two countries which are far poorer than the UK. Already statistics are showing that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has risen by 26% this year. So here we are, debating the EU strategy. Well, I can tell you it is a failure and will continue to be a failure until the European Union allows us to implement sensible border controls. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

Mr President, the EU is finally coming to its senses about biofuels and reversing its policies. Hopefully, it will not be too little, too late. My party, UKIP, has opposed since day one subsidies for crops that grow oil rapeseed for biofuel instead of wheat for bread. It is practically taking food off the plate and putting it into the petrol tank. The EU is seeking to cut subsidies for biofuel. We in UKIP would like to see them abolished altogether. What we want is to end this ugly spectacle of farmers reaping subsidies instead of food crops. The price of food in Manchester in my constituency goes up and the price of food in Morocco and Mozambique also goes up, all because of the EU’s wrong-minded policies. A report by the EU Joint Research Centre shows that the price of vegetable oil and other foods would be halved in Europe if we ended biofuels and had no subsidies. These subsidies are the hard-earned taxes of the UK taxpayer. We would all rather keep that cash in our pockets rather than throw it away on biofuel subsidies. Now here is the real point. Many say that this is all in aid of fighting so-called global warming due to man-made carbon emissions. This is increasingly discredited as a climate theory. Figures only released this week show that the world has not warmed for 20 years. Indeed, only in this year the Arctic ice cap has increased by 60%, which proves that it is as likely to grow as it is to shrink. So let us just admit it. EU biofuels and the subsidies are all about buying farmers’ votes and wielding power. They are not about putting power in fuel tanks at all.

Mr Ashworth, you have not listened to me or else you are partially hard of hearing. I did not say we are going to outlaw anything: I said we should do away with subsidies. Quite frankly, this is British taxpayers’ money. This is pushing up the price of food and it is wrong. We are in the middle of a recession and I put it to you that I would rather the price of food be reduced than line the pockets of rich farmers in the UK – and actually not just the UK but right across Europe. Biofuels are a failed experiment. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, Commissioner. This food legislation, known in the trade as Parnuts, is fortunately not as dangerous as it sounds. A year ago, UKIP voted to repeal the amendment of sports nutrition supplements from the scope of this regulation, and for once we were successful. A bit less power for the European Commission and all its unnecessary quangos is the way that we see it.  Naturally, this small victory for common sense was not based on the Commission or the Environment Committee scaling back their ambition, but on the successful lobbying of ESSNA, a small but dynamic alliance of sports nutrition companies made up of two dozen small but innovative companies – primarily from the UK – which export sports drinks and protein bars. It was the culmination of years of handiwork on their part. It is nice to reward such efforts and win a vote – even such a small vote. However, I would prefer this legislation to be made at national level. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, on the face of it, and listening to this debate, I must say that shale gas is probably the most exciting development in the sphere of energy since the discovery of North Sea oil. It will benefit my own region in particular because we in the North West of England are sitting on 4.6 trillion cubic feet of shale, which means that we have the largest shale reserves in Europe. This could provide energy for the UK for up to 50 years and create tens of thousands of jobs in the North West of England. We also know from evidence in the United States that shale gas can reduce energy prices by up to 30%, which would be a welcome break for hard-working people in the UK in a time of recession. Lastly, shale gas can also provide us with much-needed energy security, because we can become more self-sufficient and not so reliant on the Middle East and Russia for our energy supply. Shale gas would bring more jobs, cheaper energy prices and energy security. To me it seems obvious that shale must form a central part of any of our future energy policies.

 Let us not call them earthquakes because they are not. They are tiny tremors, so let us have none of this green nonsense trying to blow things up and create scare stories. In May this year a government-appointed panel said that fracking is safe in the UK and we can move ahead with stricter legislation. In July the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineers also said that it will not contaminate water supplies, so there is an answer straight to your question. Let us not get caught up in green scare stories, because you have driven this debate on man-made climate change for too long with these scare stories and your green agenda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I must congratulate our colleague on coming round to the UKIP position. We have been saying for many years now that Greece would be better off leaving the euro and going back to the drachma. But this is not the position of his government and it is certainly not the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Does my colleague agree or disagree with the position of the British Government? Does he agree with the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that more fiscal union is needed and that Greece would be better off in the euro, or is his position completely different from that of his own government? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, figures show that the pay gap between men and women is still large. After all these years of EU gender equality regulations, targets, and initiatives, the situation is still pretty poor. And now you want to introduce quotas for women in boardrooms. To be perfectly honest, when I read it, I did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Because, if a women is dedicated and good she can get to the top. Did Margaret Thatcher need quotas to become the British Prime Minister? No, she did not. She did it based on raw ability, an iron will and because she was the best person for the job. When you bring in quotas you lessen quality. You promote mediocrity and I contend that businesses should have the right to hire the best person for the job and it should not matter whether they are male, female, black or white or anything else. It is called a meritocracy and it is something which Britain and the English-speaking peoples of the world have been pioneering for centuries. How would you feel, if you were a women who had worked very hard and had gone into management, only for a token woman to be handed a similar job? If anything, this will create a culture of discrimination. As colleagues will constantly ask, did you get there because you are good or did you get there because you ticked a few boxes? You call this positive discrimination. I contend that discrimination is never positive. So here we have it. In a desperate bid to sound popular you are not only patronising women, you are promoting mediocrity and you are hampering business. I would urge all Members to vote against this report tomorrow.

 If a woman is good enough, she will be promoted. It is as simple as that. What we should have is a situation where we are not hampering business with regulation in times of austerity. What we should be doing is ripping up red tape and allowing businesses to hire the best person for the job, not introducing even more ‘big state’ legislation and tying the hands of businesses. No, let us do the opposite. Let us deregulate and let us ensure that the best person for the job gets it, regardless of gender, colour, creed, religion or anything else. The best person should always get the job. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 No I would not; but I would not say that women would probably do a better job. Hang on – the greatest monarchs that we have ever had in our country have been women. Undoubtedly! Probably our greatest Prime Minister of the last century was a woman. It is as simple as that. But she got there – and the Labour Party probably does not like that fact, but there we are – purely on merit because she was the best person for the job. I tell you that, if you go down this line, all you are doing is tying the hands of businesses in times of austerity. It is wrong! You should deregulate. You should do away with red tape and give businesses the freedom to hire the people they want. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commission intends to impose a new interpretation of the weight and dimensions of HGVs to allow for cross-border traffic of mega trucks. This measure would allow mega trucks into the UK through the back door because in the end the government will surrender to a ruling on competition grounds. In making this decision, no research to assess the safety, congestion and pollution impact has been taken. In 2009 the Commission stated that mega trucks are more dangerous than standard HGVs. The Commission is not even waiting to analyse the public consultation, which only closed in February. Of course the Commission interpretation will become a minimum standard and so lorries could get bigger, even beyond the 25 metres. This will surely have a massive impact on safety and cost to the British taxpayer. For example, how many bridges up and down the country in the UK will have to be reinforced to accommodate these heavier loads? This just shows you the power that these unelected EU Commissioners have. No one voted for them, and yet they can make unilateral decisions, off the cuff, which will affect local areas and businesses right across the UK. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, this is essentially a commercial problem, and if action is needed, then it is a situation crying out to be addressed by the private sector acting in its own commercial interests, under the law. But instead we get this report, which has all the hallmarks of everything which is worst about the EU and the Commission in particular, because it is going to be done using taxpayers’ money. I thought there was a crisis on. I thought we were living in a time of austerity necessitated by excessive government debt but, as ever, the taxpayer will be required to provide money that he or she can ill afford. The Commission likes to pretend that this will not require any extra resources, but I am more likely to believe that a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. We are creating and extending a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies always set out to justify themselves by showing both the massive scale of the problem and the need for more complex solutions. You can see it in this report and in the proposed legislation. It states facts which can only be conjecture. It is telling that you cannot be precise, or even necessarily in the right ballpark, when assessing grey economic activity. I do not see any proof that this new extension of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will either save EUR 10 billion or 185 000 jobs, yet that is the claim. To paraphrase Mandy Rice-Davies, ‘they would say that, wouldn’t they?’ Before I could back any of the proposals such as this, I would require some kind of guarantee that this would work and save the taxpayer money. I do not want to be unkind, but is it not nice for the office to be put in Alicante? You would think that an office like this would be put in an established commercial centre or a place associated with innovation, entrepreneurship and growth, but it is placed on the Costa Blanca. It reminds me of the famous song ‘Oh we do like to live beside the seaside, oh we do like to live beside the sea’ because – come on, let us get real – we are once again seeing taxpayers’ money being thrown at ‘jobs for the boys’ corporatism. Where is the evidence for European consumers and taxpayers that they will be better off? That would be a real impact assessment, not the usual Commission approach of assuming what it seeks to prove. What we have here is the usual manifestation of the Commission’s proposals, because it will be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It will never, ever, be brought in at a saving to the taxpayer. It will become eventually, as all these things always do, another bureaucratic monster. It is no more than a proto-agency right now but, as ever, it will grow and it will grow. I predict that, sitting there by the Costa Brava beach, the office and its lucky bureaucrats will become bloated on sun, sangria and paella. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, paragraph 100 of this report clearly states that you would like to see the EU flag at major sporting events and on the jerseys of athletes. Are we now going to see the EU flag at the British Olympics, at the Champions League Final or even on the shirt of the England captain? This is nothing more than sheer EU propaganda and vanity. The EU has never been so unpopular, yet here you are, wanting to stamp your flag on sporting stars in the hope that you can force the people to love you. But they will not. What you propose also seems to break the rules of sporting competitions. For example, under Law 4, Decision 1 of the FIFA laws of the game, it states: ‘The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or FIFA.’ What right do you think the EU has to interfere in sport in such a way to encourage countries to break the rules? It is hypocritical, because the EU is in effect a political organisation. You even say in paragraph 20 of the report that political propaganda should be banned, which is hypocritical. Athletes proudly wear the flag of their own national countries. They should not wear the flag of the European Union.

Blue-card answer. 
– 
Mr President, I would like to agree with my colleague. The EU is not a country; the EU is a false state. What is being created is something very dangerous, because false states like the Soviet Union only ever break up in one of two ways. They break up in peaceful divorce, like Czechoslovakia – which is the way in which I hope this organisation will break up – or in bloody revolution, like Yugoslavia – which I fear very much indeed. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the EU world view is that it knows best about everything, from global warming scare stories to food labels. But the truth is that it is the consumer who is paying and not the EU and the consumer will choose what he or she wants to eat. Of course, some kind of labelling is just common sense, whether it is nutritional information or allergies but I would suggest that much of this report is nannying in the excess. I also fear that it will come at a cost and that that cost will then be pushed onto the consumer, which seems to me to be particularly dangerous at a time of an economic downturn. But here is the crux and I repeat it in almost every speech I give. We all know that the UK can pass laws itself, indeed our parliament was known as the mother of parliaments for many years. This is a decision that should be taken at nation state level. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but, in my experience, that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation, because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it. Let us be frank. This is about – and I quote – ‘air emissions and environmental taxes’, just as the last speaker said. So the Sovietisation of the EU continues. The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and – let us be honest – you want this data to tax and control, which explains your thirst for ever more statistics. The worst thing of all is that this is a regulation, not a directive. Regulations are far worse than directives because they pass into UK law and bypass the UK Parliament. This is very dangerous and, my friends, this is the way democracy dies. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, let me make the first point. The fact of the matter is that this place likes to control things from the centre. Let us also make another point, that none of the Commissioners are actually elected by the people. Democracy matters for the whole of Europe so, yes, I do believe that we are seeing a Sovietisation of Europe. The fact of the matter is that these decisions should be taken at Member State level. The fact that regulations can bypass my own parliament, can bypass the people who were elected by the British people, is an absolute disgrace and, yes, it is the Sovietisation of Europe. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, my father is a small businessman. He owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the Conservative Prime Minister and true Eurosceptic, Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s. Like all small businessmen, he is overburdened with red tape and regulation – much of it emanating from this place, the European Parliament. My father’s small business remains small. However, these kinds of businesses are the bedrock of the British economy and they amount to a staggering 73% of all businesses in the UK. My father drives a van, and like many small businesses, he is struggling due to the recession. I have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father’s out of business for ever, because we are told that this legislation will, in fact, put up to EUR 5 000 on the price of vans. Small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife. The gentleman from the Socialists said that this is a good day for climate change policy in the EU. However, if this goes through, I guarantee it will be a bad day for small businessmen across the continent. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, again, this place shows absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in the real world. People are struggling out there, and what this legislation does – and it has been made quite clear to us – is put up the cost of small vans which are driven by many small businessmen across the continent. It will put it up by at least EUR 5 000. That is totally and utterly wrong, and it is something that we can ill afford in a time of recession. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, does the right honourable gentleman really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will, in effect, push up the cost of vehicles? He knows it will, and I know it will. In effect, what it will be doing is putting small firms in Liverpool and Manchester – in his own constituency – out of business. Does he think that is fair? Does he think it is morally correct? Is he prepared to stand on that platform in the elections in three years’ time? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, mobile phones, phone chargers, play stations, cameras, saunas, thermometers, refrigerators, freezers, toasters, kettles, microwaves, irons, air fresheners, clocks, watches, electric toothbrushes, DVD players, vacuum cleaners, children’s toys, video games, medical devices, televisions, remote controls, calculators, heaters, tumble dryers and washing machines. Well, that is just to name a few, because all of these appliances and many more will undoubtedly rise in price as a result of this waste directive. And to think that the European Union is prepared to pile this legislation on just at a time when we are in the depths of a recession and when people are struggling to make ends meet! I therefore encourage everyone in this Chamber to show sympathy with the hardworking taxpayers and with small-to-medium-sized businesses and put this prospective law in the waste bin. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I too enjoy my jousts with Mr Davies. It seems that we have these little jousts on every speech that I give. He knows as well as I do where the cost will lie – it will end up with the taxpayer having to fund this. At the moment, we are in the depths of a recession the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s. I am standing up for hardworking taxpayers. Secondly, the real point here is that this should be done at national level by people – by politicians – who are accountable to the electorate, not by a Commission that meets in secret and is accountable to nobody. That is the key. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, first of all I will repeat what I just said. We all know where the cost ends up – where it always does. It does not necessarily have to say it in the directive, because it never does. You never tell people that you are going to put up tax. You never tell people that you are going to hit them in the pocket. In my country, for example, it costs us GBP 50 million a day to be members of this club. The key to all of this is – and I go back to exactly what I said to Mr Davies – decisions should be made at nation-state level by politicians who are accountable to the electorate. The electorate of my country, Great Britain, cannot remove Commissioners. That is fundamentally undemocratic and wrong. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I support the protection of victims. However, when I first came across the European Protection Order, I thought it sounded scary, like the European Arrest Warrant, which, in my opinion, is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people. The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women. We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism – and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that. Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law. If proof were needed, we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant. I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK, for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life. We have a saying in England: ‘once bitten, twice shy’. We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant. I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I hope everyone enjoyed Cancún. It is a lovely place but I am a bit disappointed to see that none of them has a suntan. Well, I suppose that is to be expected really because, while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming, it was actually the coldest week that Mexican city had seen for over a hundred years. Back in the UK, we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest Novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming. Do these people think we were born yesterday? This also explains why even more British people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control. But what have you actually achieved in Cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers’ money in the guise of the Green Climate Fund, which I suggest will end up being a lucky bag for African dictators to buy themselves more Mercedes Benzes and private jets? Personally, I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed, and I think the ‘Politics of Envy Fund’ would be better and closer to the truth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You are giving the game away there, because what you are talking about is world governments, politicians. We are talking about scientists here. Science is a slow process, evidence has to be studied and deciphered, but politics is a quicker game and politics is running ahead of the science; that is where the problem lies. The fact of the matter is that the globe is actually not warming; it has not warmed since 1998. So the game is up, people are finding out that you have a problem. What you are doing is conning people; it is a scam and the people are finding you out. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. 
– Madam President, one of the totems of a sovereign state is that it controls who can and who cannot come into its own country. Unfortunately, several governments in the UK have given away this power to unelected, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels. What a disaster it has proven to be. We have a situation now where we have uncontrolled EU immigration into our country, which has resulted in wages being driven down and people – indigenous people – being put out of work. I do not believe that this EU immigration liaison officers’ network has any power to stop this happening at all. We also have a two-tier immigration system in our country whereby if you are from Australia or New Zealand or anywhere else, you have a cap. However, if you are from Latvia or Poland or any of the EU countries, you can come to our country willy-nilly. This is fundamentally wrong. It is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration, but what happens if a country like Romania, for example, basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants? What it does is it makes a mockery of the whole system. I support elected politicians in the UK having control over our own borders. What I do not support are unaccountable, unelected appointees. I believe that the strengthening of this network would not be necessary if each individual Member State had the power to control who does and who does not come onto its lands. I therefore implore everybody to reject this report. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, if doctors and dentists and people like that want to come to the UK to work – and we need their skills – then by all means they should come, but what we have at the moment is a situation where our market is saturated: we cannot control who comes from the EU and who does not. This is fundamentally wrong. It is bad and it is putting people out of work. I shall give you an example. The taxi driver who drove me to the airport this morning was a bricklayer who has been laid off as a result of Polish people coming onto the site, undercutting British workers, and now he is driving a taxi. That cannot be right. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, ‘biodiversity’ is a word I often hear bandied about by Eurocrats, MEPs and lobbyists out here in Brussels. But I wonder if anybody in here can actually define what it really means, because I bet my bottom dollar that none of you can. Oddly enough, I think it does matter that you understand what you are talking about if you are making laws for the whole of the EU. But what does the conveniently vague and ambiguous term ‘biodiversity’ actually mean? Because the truth of the matter is that there is no correct number of species, whether it is on a Cumbrian farm or a Liverpool suburb or even in a Cheshire forest, and I defy the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to come up with a proper definition or stop using such ragbag words. And, may I ask, where is the boundary of the biodiverse area? Is it ever applied to offshore marine environments? And if so, why are you so keen to build monstrous wind farms that are detrimental to wildlife and do not even work! Let us be frank, you have not got a clue. There is no clear thinking, no coherent policy and no logic to what you are proposing. If you are going to preach, which is what you are doing, look in the mirror first, sort your own house out and let us start with the disaster which is the common fisheries policy. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, let us put a few facts in order. If you want examples of species which are disappearing, there are a lot of dodgy statistics out there – take polar bears as an example. People constantly say that the polar bear population has fallen. Yet the polar bear population is actually bigger now than it was in the 1940s. I agree that species are disappearing, but I do not believe that the European Union – which is fundamentally undemocratic, the British people have never had a say on it – is the forum to decide this matter. It should be done in nation states. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

in writing. 
– The amendment allows the many people in the EU, and the MEPs who represent them, to signal their unhappiness and opposition to Turkish membership and the concomitant political union. However, we do not want this to be at the expense of supporting free trade with Turkey – and without tariff barriers – so much of the report is unchanged. Many choices are invidious: free trade agreements allow tariff barriers. Customs unions eliminate them internally but continue to allow and even erect them externally. And, of course, customs unions limit and prohibit members’ freedom of commercial negotiation. Despite these concerns about customs unions as a concept, in the context of Turkey’s circumstances, we are accepting that part of the report’s content relating to the customs union because it allows those against full Turkish EU membership to register their vote. It should be noted that in the event, only 38 MEPs out of 736 put their vote against Turkey entering Political Union. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I must say that it is quite enthusing to see that there are so many MEPs who treat this place with the contempt I do. Out of the 736, there are fewer than 30 of them here – which is under five percent – and it is half four on a Tuesday afternoon. As usual, EU rules and regulations are running out of control. But that is nothing compared to the rats and mice that will run out of control when the EU takes away common rat poison from ordinary householders. This is what Amendment 243 of this report will do. This daft piece of legislation will ensure that only professionals will be allowed to put down rat poison, which is freely available in shops. So, if rats are in your front garden, spreading their diseases and chewing everything up, the ordinary UK householder will be forced to wait for the Council rat catcher or have to pay for Rentokil. We are already told that you are never further than 20 yards away from a rat in a city centre in the UK. This piece of crazy legislation will only make things worse. To put this into perspective, this is a piece of bureaucracy for a rat poison that has been safely used by ordinary folk for the past 30 years – not only in the UK, but across Europe and in the USA. I will finish by asking a question. Why are you doing this? Do you want more vermin? Do you want more disease? Or is it just about control and your obsession with trying to govern every single aspect of our lives? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to bring to this House’s attention a riddle which seems to be confusing MEPs from my own region in the North-West of England. In November 2009, Cumbria, which is in the northern part of my constituency, was hit by serious flooding. Homes were destroyed, businesses were ruined and sadly, a life was lost. As a result of the disaster, the British Government had every right to apply for the EU Solidarity Fund for assistance, and I am led to believe that the money which could have come in aid could have been up to GBP 100 million. Bizarrely, however, the British Government failed to apply. The people of Cumbria are honest folk. They work hard and they pay their taxes and a good portion of that is sent out to Brussels. Therefore, I believe that they have the right to ask for some of their money back, and I consider it a failure of the Labour Government that it failed to act on this issue. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I am increasingly concerned about the way local councils in my constituency in the North West of England are using car parking charges to top up their revenue. Take the small town of Congleton, for example, which is a local semi-rural community. The introduction of car parking charges will severely damage local industry and a fall-off in trade will result in a loss of revenue, forcing already hard-pressed SMEs into bankruptcy and possible closure. People are blaming the British Government, some blame the Unitary Council and others point the finger at the town council but, as always, the dark hand of the European Union lies in the background, for they are all working towards the framework set out in the EU’s European transport policy for 2010. You see, this is the genius of the EU: it is always one person removed. Whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections, the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of Brussels does not appear on the radar. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, please allow me to speak frankly as one Lancastrian to another, because this is not going very well, is it? It really is not. Earlier on, Baroness Ashton, you said that Europe needs a credible foreign policy. How can we have a credible foreign policy when it has an incredible High Representative? You seem as if you are stumbling from one crisis to another, so much so that the British Foreign Secretary had to write you a letter this week asking you to buck up, to get on your game. But we in UKIP were on to this from the start. We opposed your appointment because we said you would be clearly out of your depth – and we are being proved right. It was said that your appointment, made by the Commission, would stop the traffic in Tokyo and Washington. But you have not even been able to appoint the Ambassador to Washington because old Barroso did you up like a kipper! It is also claimed in the British press that you do not turn your phone on after 8 p.m. at night. But, Baroness Ashton, you are the highest-paid female politician in the world. You are paid more than Frau Merkel, you are paid more than Hillary Clinton: it is a 24-hour job. To top it all, yesterday it was reported that you are being provided with a Learjet. You are expected to do 300 000 miles per year. That would get you to the moon, and most people now would like you to stay there. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Madam President, contrary to the belief of the Commission, the debate regarding man-made climate change is far from over. In the past month alone, we have had the scandal of the University of East Anglia; then we have had the debacle over the Himalayan glaciers and now, we have got questions over the effect climate change will have on wildlife in the Amazon. Research has shown that at least 20 passages in the IPCC’s report cite non-peer-reviewed World Wildlife Fund or Greenpeace reports as authority. This is not science. We need solid, peer-reviewed scientific evidence, not the work of pressure groups using climate change to further their own agendas or politicians who use climate change to justify the existence of the European Union. I would like to ask whether it is now time to pause, to take stock and consider the ramifications of bounding ahead with policies that could damage economies, result in job losses or potentially result in energy chaos.

– While this report points to a rather less awful CFP than the monstrosity we have now, it nevertheless recommends leaving fisheries under the predatory control of the undemocratic and anti-democratic ‘European Union’, and, for this reason, cannot be endorsed by UKIP. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I requested to make this one-minute speech to highlight the terrible effect that fortnightly bin collections are having upon communities in my constituency in the north-west of England. Take my home town of Bootle, for example, where many families live in terraced houses with no front gardens and little space at the rear. It is crazy that they are forced to put out waste every two weeks. This, naturally, has caused pile-ups of rubbish, because there is no storage space. If we have a hot summer, you can be sure that this will lead to an increase in vermin, which in turn is a public health hazard. But why am I telling this House? Well, because fortnightly bin collections are the direct result of the EU’s Landfill Directive, which was supported in this Chamber by the British Labour Party and the Conservatives. I for one hope that a large number of British voters bear this in mind when they go to the polls in the general election later this year. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, may I first say that I have sympathy with the workers in Antwerp, but I would like to point out another couple of issues regarding the EU and General Motors. Spyker Cars becomes Saab Spyker in a EUR 400 million deal but, make no mistake, this is not a normal commercial deal where one company pays and another company is paid. This is a Commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy. Spyker pays, but using money from the European Investment Bank. In other words, the European taxpayer pays and the whole deal is underwritten by the Swedish Government. Of course, only the risk is underwritten. General Motors will still take a share of the profits and Saab Spyker will be obliged to buy fully assembled cars from another General Motors plant, one located in that well-known European nation of Mexico. Why are we saving jobs in Mexico with European taxpayers’ money? Can we not rebody Vectras at the Ellesmere Port plant in my constituency? For that is all Saab has been reduced to. And it is also common knowledge that General Motors and the European institutions have a special relationship. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pumped over EUR 160 million into General Motors’ operations in Russia and Ukraine, and it owns a 30% equity stake in the General Motors manufacturing plant in St Petersburg. So I would like to ask the Commission why such extravagant financial support is available to countries such as Ukraine and Mexico but is never available to British companies. Rover could have been saved for a fraction of the price, and jobs probably could have been saved at Rolls Royce in Netherton on Merseyside, in my constituency, but at the moment, General Motors jobs in my constituency in the north-west of England are still at risk and yet the Commission is using my constituents’ tax revenues to secure General Motors jobs in Mexico and Russia. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have recently heard that there is to be a closure of the Corus steel works on Teesside in northern England. This is due to an EU target reduction of 20% of carbon emissions. Thanks to the carbon credit, Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers, including suppliers. We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law. The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme, which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years. But surprise, surprise – guess what: the head of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, is also the head of the Tata Foundation, so, one must ask, cui bono
? Because Tata owns Corus. (Protests from the floor)
 The question I would like to ask is: is it now official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside so that they can outsource their business to countries such as India, or is there a more personal interest at stake here? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You did not answer my question, because the question was: is it official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside and outsource the business to countries such as India? You did not answer the question. Would you please answer it? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I have just heard a Socialist colleague over there talking about Greenland and the ice melting in Greenland. The question I would like to ask on this subject is: why is Greenland called Greenland? Is it perhaps because Greenland was once green when the world was hotter? It seems that the British people are onto this, because a recent opinion poll in The Times
 newspaper clearly shows that the British people no longer believe in so-called man-made global warming. The British people are very astute and they are clear that politicians have hijacked the environmentalist agenda. It is being cynically used to raise taxes, to exert control, and now it is being used by the European Union to justify its own existence. This week, we have also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate-research centres in the UK, which advises the government, being caught altering data and stifling debate. It is an absolute disgrace. I look forward to Copenhagen, when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room, which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past 10 years. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Madam President, I would like to draw this assembly’s attention to the disastrous effect that the Biocides Directive is having across the UK. This punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine, which has been used to control the mole population in the UK for the past 70 years. This was the case until the EU got itself involved. As a result, mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate, which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business. But it gets worse. While strychnine kills a mole in up to 15 minutes, aluminium phosphate takes up to three days, ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death. This crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the UK, but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the UK is better off out. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union. The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or of my real parliament at Westminster. The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink. The people have been bypassed, but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people. Just take a look at what has happened with the Lisbon Treaty. It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue. They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee. To conclude, on the eve of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out all over Europe. Well done to the European Union, because, with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change, what you are doing is proving Sir Edward’s unfortunate prophecy to be correct.

 UKIP’s position is against. The Regulation restricts freedom of contract, grants powers to ESMA (including the power to prohibit investment products) and empowers the Commission to pass delegated acts and to adopt regulatory technical standards. Transparency in OTC dealings is all very well, but the volume of the information produced will be unmanageable within any reasonable time frame – rendering the process meaningless. EMIR regulates derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories in the European Union. The proposal creates new requirements to mitigate the risks associated with the derivatives markets, following the lessons from the financial crisis. It introduces new requirements for transparency, as well as organisational requirements and prudential standards for both CCPs and trade repositories. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This is a major piece of legislation, relating to financial services, and therefore has the potential to have a significant effect on the UK economy.

 Mr President, I was speaking today primarily not as a UKIP MEP but as a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales. One fact is beyond dispute: the Court of Auditors has not passed the accounts of the European Union for the last 19 years. This is even though the Court has only to sign off a declaration of assurance, which is probably a lessor standard than the true and fair view of the Anglo-American world. This, then, is the context: the context of 19 years of unsigned accounts, in which this Parliament is now discussing own resources – and the conclusion is clear. The institutions of the European Union are unreformable, otherwise they would have been reformed back in 1994 – the first time that the accountants did not pass the test of the Auditors. This is a disgrace, and I hope that the next Parliament will do something about it because for sure this Parliament will not. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 You mentioned in your remarks that we should look at the impact of climate change on flooding. Have you ever considered the impact and consequent causes of EU directives on flooding? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Madam President, my constituents in the area known as the Somerset levels have suffered badly from flooding. This flooding is in large part the direct consequence of EU directives, especially the EU directive on wildlife. Money has gone on wildlife habitats, and routine maintenance and dredging – which is highly necessary – has been barred. People in the Somerset levels are prime candidates to benefit from EU solidarity funding. They should get back some of the disproportionate amount that we in the UK are paying to the EU. However, the UK’s coalition government has not even applied. This is an appalling decision, and I therefore ask two questions.

However, much of the drafting fails to make adequate distinction between the UK and the Eurozone, leaving room for judicial ‘interpretation’ to harmonise across the whole single/internal market – in fact the Committee amendments expressly encourage this.

 Our position is against. This directive introduces rules relating to payment accounts, with a particular focus on transparency for fees, easier switching mechanisms and broader access to basic bank accounts. Many elements of this reform have already been in place in the UK for some time, and the UK’s prime objective in negotiations on this file was to ensure that key elements of its own system were preserved. Unnecessary harmonisation, over-regulation and interference in freedom of contract. The right to a bank account may sound beneficial but would be more easily delivered by abandoning the over-regulation resulting from anti-money laundering regulations.

 Our position is against. More ‘retail-friendly’ legislation designed to eliminate risk, without realising this also stifles innovation and adds cost without reward. The consumer is already adequately covered by existing legislation and by common law, so it would be better to focus energy on improving enforcement rather than fiddling with the rules to create unnecessary harmonisation for its own sake. This regulation creates a new Key Information Document (KID) to be produced by investment product manufacturers and provided to retail customers when they are considering buying investment products.

 UKIP’s position is against. This Regulation establishes a EU procedure for a protective measure which enables a creditor to obtain a European Account Preservation Order (‘EAPO’) preventing the withdrawal or transfer of funds held by the debtor in a bank account within the Union. The EAPO will be available to the creditor as an alternative to protective measures existing under national law in the Member States. This is an unnecessary piece of legislation.

Environmental information, for instance, will have to include greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and the use of renewable energy. With reference to social and staff-related matters, the information should concern, amongst other things, the implementation of fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, working conditions and social dialogue. Information relating to human rights and the fight against corruption, however, will have to include at least data concerning the prevention of human rights infringements and explanations as to the tools used by the undertaking to combat corruption and bribery.

 Mr President, I am going to focus on paragraph 46 of the report. This says, and I quote, ‘an EU seat in an enlarged UN Security Council remains a central, long-term goal of the European Union’. Later, it calls for – and I quote again – ‘the introduction of new members of the UN Security Council and reform of the UN Security Council’s decision-making towards the possible use of a super-qualified majority’. In the European Union, the United Kingdom has very little influence. We have just 8.24[nbsp ]% of the weighted votes in the Council of Ministers, less than 10[nbsp ]% of MEPs and the ability to appoint just one of 28 Commissioners. However, the UK is represented in its own right in international organisations. Perhaps the most significant is the UK’s permanent seat on the UN Security Council and the veto that goes with it. This report, and the thinking behind it, puts at risk the UK’s seat on the UN Security Council and also the UK’s veto. Let us be crystal clear. The UK’s continuing membership of the European Union does not enhance our influence in the world. It is in fact exactly the other way round. Our influence is thereby, and inevitably, diminished.

 With the greatest possible respect you actually got it wrong. There is a seat on the UN Security Council. That seat has a veto. What the report proposes is that the EU should have a seat.

 Mr Ashworth, first of all I should like to thank you for accepting my question. Your party, the British Conservative Party, is a vociferous supporter of – it may even be said to be a cheerleader for – the entry of Turkey into the European Union. Turkey is getting pre-accession funding of about EUR[nbsp ]900 million a year, which is planned to continue for another six years. How does your party’s support for Turkey sit alongside your two principles of limited funding and value for money? I look forward to your answer. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I am just going to address one item in the budget, and that is the instrument for pre-accession funding. In seven years from 2014, the European Union has budgeted over EUR[nbsp ]14 billion to be paid to countries who are not EU Member States. These countries get the money because they are candidate countries. They are a former Yugoslav Republic, Iceland, Montenegro, and the one that gets the most money: Turkey. And Turkey especially will cost us even more in cohesion funds should it become a Member State. Bizarrely, the establishment parties in the UK are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the European Union. And let me be crystal clear: any political party that supports, let alone vociferously supports, Turkey’s candidacy can have no credibility when it comes to controlling, let alone cutting, the vast and wasteful EU budget.

 Madam President, geographically, Turkey is 97% in Asia. However, the Turkish Government’s attitude to dissent places it 100% in the Middle East. There is – like in Cuba – a bill to curb internet freedom. The Justice Minister has powers to appoint and discipline judges and prosecutors. Worst of all, currently there are 40 journalists in prison in Turkey. The Commissioner, in his arrogant self-absorption, said that he had spoken to the Turks about this. They are clearly not paying any attention to the Commissioner at all. In Turkey there is a subjugation of the media, the judiciary and civil society that is almost without precedent in a seeming democracy. To put it simply, Turkey does not subscribe to Western values. Turkey should be regarded as too big, too poor, too different and too authoritarian ever to become a member of the European Union. It is totally depressing that the establishment UK political parties are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the EU. They – and this House – should think again.

 Mr Sánchez Presedo, thank you very much for taking my question. You mentioned in your remarks what the interpreter translated as ‘automatic exchange of information’ and ‘transparency’. In your view, should automatic exchange of information and transparency include the role of Luxembourg as a tax haven for multinational companies within the European Union, and is it legitimate therefore for Mr Santer to put himself forward as a candidate for President of the Commission when he has presided over a tax haven?

 One hundred and twenty years ago, the British Parliament passed the Sale of Goods Act. In 1979, that Act was re-enacted with minor amendments and it remains very much the same today. Every day in Britain, millions of people and thousands of businesses buy and sell under contracts governed by the Sale of Goods Act. The Act has stood the test of time because it is a model of brevity, clarity and simplicity. Now along comes the Commission, in its self-absorbed wisdom, proffering a common European sales law. Twice the length of the UK Sale of Goods Act, it is a minor masterpiece of legislative flatulence which will benefit only lawyers. It is voluntary for the UK at the moment, but on past form our British consumers will eventually be deprived of the tried and tested benefits of English law and our government will be powerless.

Mark my words: UK electors have had enough of this. By the way, Commissioner Reding, please
 come back to the UK soon and often. Every out-of-touch, arrogant utterance from you gains the UK Independence Party an extra MEP. One thing which we can be sure of – and which I predict now – is that we shall have a very different Parliament in May, which would vote down this arrogant, out-of-touch, useless piece of legislation, which actually comes out of a Commission which acts against the interests of the people and not with them.

In addition this contains requirements concerning confiscation of assets without conviction in certain cases. The UK already has similar legislation. UKIP tends to oppose the giving to the state of draconian powers of (often) arbitrary confiscation in the absence of a criminal conviction. We support, however, reasonable and proportionate measures for deprivation of assets where a criminal conviction has been registered after a fair trial.

This agency, however, is a top-down imposition.

 UKIP’s position is against. This own-initiative report has some positive points, and points out: a) that the widening interest rate spreads have significantly reduced the room for manoeuvre as regards fiscal policy in a number of Member States; b) the lack of ambitious reforms to enhance competitiveness; c) the importance of rectifying excessive deficit situations and current account imbalances; d) that the Member States and the Commission are not delivering on their commitment to complete the single market; e) that the Annual Growth Survey does not provide the means to achieve its objectives; f) that most Member States are still losing market shares globally and have a large negative net international investment position; g) only two of the Member States have attained their medium-term objective.

 Mr President, to declare an interest, I have the honour to represent Gibraltar and its people. I am speaking now to address potential problems at Gibraltar airport. The context is that the Government of Spain systematically – and as I see it, vindictively – inflicts petty controls at the land border between Gibraltar and Spain. This has resulted in massive and unacceptable delays. Incidentally, the people who suffer are mostly Spanish citizens. Because of the problems at the land border, air travel becomes of prime importance. Attempts have been made, and are being made, by Members of this Parliament, by means of legislative devices, to suffocate air travel in and out of Gibraltar’s airport. This must not be. This is a disgrace and I urge colleagues to support the amendments today. I would further go on to say... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Sir, let me first of all assure you that my memory is excellent, and I suspect rather better than yours. Yes, the Commission did make a visit. The Commission stupidly and predictably gave the Spanish Government about six weeks’ notice, so for the purpose of that one visit the Spanish authorities, for want of a better word, ‘cleaned up their act’. The reality is that these delays are still going on and you and your colleague should be heartily ashamed of yourselves. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth,

 Mr President, of course we are all, in principle, against subsidised imports – that is dumping – and there has to be trade defence when trade counterparties decline to accept the principles that underpin free and open trade. But by trade defence we do not mean what happened when the otherwise distinguished EU Commissioner for Trade was happy to launch what might have become a full-scale trade war with China over the comparatively minor matter of solar panels. I have described this previously as a frolic. It also took place against the representations of 17 of the then 27 Member States. This report, in its essentials, gives greater scope, power and discretion to the Commission. Illegal dumping by third countries of course needs to be dealt with, but not by appointed trade officials acting on a whim. The European Union, in its beginnings and in its operations, is a protectionist construct. On open trade, it is simply not credible. In the context of dumping, the way forward is a sense of proportionality. That is how an independent Britain should handle this problem, and there will be an independent Britain sooner than most people think – and that ‘most people’ includes the President of Italy today.

 Madam President, in foreign policy, in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, there was no consensus, no consensus at all, amongst the Member States. Yet again we see an EU activity that is wasteful, contemptuous of the taxpayer (as my colleague who has left his place was earlier) and duplicates what is already being performed and better executed – and this is the key point – at the national level. Nevertheless, to give just one example, the European Union is now operating an incredible 140 embassies or equivalent, and this costs a lot. To make matters worse, the value of the salary package of up to 500 of the personnel is greater than that received by the British Prime Minister. This is all a gravy train for those who work in it, with no real positive, realistic function, and I feel sure that electorate will come to the same conclusion in May of next year.

Mr Salafranca, thank you for taking the intervention. At the present time, there is no proper free movement between Spain and Gibraltar, which I have the honour to represent.

William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

Mr President, Libya was the most recent conflict directly concerning Member States, and just 11 of the Member States supported the UN resolution. From this and other examples, it is clear that, in fact and reality, there is no – and I repeat no – common foreign and security policy between Member States. What there is, is an EU Foreign Service – the External Action Service – apparently with 30 missions, and what that is, is a gigantic gravy train for EU insiders and their hangers-on. My amendment in June proposed that External Action Service personnel be restricted to ten weeks’ paid holiday a year. Just 84 MEPs voted in favour. This is shameful, and I hope it will be very different in the next Parliament.

). -  
Mr President, as has been said, 26 Member States have individual bilateral investment agreements in force with China, and it would be a better use of everyone’s time if the Trade Commissioner dropped the attempt to negotiate an EU-China Investment Agreement and simply left it to the outstanding two, Latvia and Ireland, to negotiate their own agreement. But there is another vital point here. Switzerland has a trade agreement with China, New Zealand has a trade agreement with China, and in particular Iceland has a trade agreement with China. The fact is that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade bloc in order to sign trade agreements. Demonstrably, it is just not true.  Iceland, as most of us know, has now suspended its application for EU Membership. In my view, it is a very wise decision. In the context just of trade, were Iceland to join the EU, it would then be obliged to abandon the trade agreement it already has with China. And so, colleagues, the message for the UK is very clear.

Mr President, the EEAS is the EU’s Foreign Service. An EU Foreign Service is based on the assumption that there is a communality of interest among the 27 Member States. This is a fallacy. In Libya, only eight European countries took part, not 27, and one of them was not a member of the EU. The 27 Member States are – to coin a phrase – ‘a coalition of the unwilling’, and sometimes less than that. There is also the sheer wasteful cost of the EU’s Foreign Service. EEAS staff are very highly paid. Indeed, up to one hundred officials enjoy take-home pay that is more than that of Britain’s Foreign Secretary. The financial climate has the consequence that the UK is closing down embassies and consulates. Nonetheless, we are made to contribute – and to contribute very substantially – to the EU’s Foreign Service in order to advance a foreign policy that is not – I repeat not – ours. All of this – the EEAS – is a demonstration yet again that Britain’s membership of the EU in actuality diminishes our influence in the world. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

). -  
Mr President, Bosnia has an eye-watering unemployment rate of 43%. It is yet another very poor Eastern European country in line to join the EU. Once the door is open to Bosnia, there will be a massive outflow of people. The UK will then be a magnet. Back home, the British Conservative Party claims to be committed to reducing immigration. But, as we all know, that is an impossibility so long as we remain in the EU, and the impossibility is compounded as more countries get EU membership and their people in consequence have the right of free movement. It is simply breathtaking that the British Government and the Labour Party, none of whose representatives are here, can support – and support actively – Bosnia Herzegovina joining the EU.

Mr Rouček, I think with respect that you are missing the point. It is not very many at the moment, but that is precisely because we are able to have immigration controls. Should Bosnia-Herzegovina become a member of the European Union, we would then have no immigration controls, as you and your colleagues have said in this House many times – and, I regret to say it, with the support of the Commission.

 Madam President, my government, the British Government, recognises that the current legislation needs toughening up because of compromises, but is basically in favour. The rapporteur herself is unhappy with at least most of the amendments and is asking for a pass on the whole thing without the amendments. However, within that, the provision of services is already catered for because it is prohibited to prevent a worker in this situation, on grounds of residence or nationality, from working in another state by way of posting. The rapporteur’s latest brief emphasises workers’ rights when posted to another country, but surely that is a question of the national law of that country. If that is followed, why is there the need for extra legislation? Let the national law take care of it. But that brings me unfortunately to the dreadful business of the Laval case. That was 10 years ago now but it is still relevant. Here you will remember a Latvian firm won a contract to build an educational facility in Sweden and brought in a team of Latvian workers to do the job. By way of collective agreement, they undertook to pay those workers less than the Swedish minimum wage, which was an act of law in Sweden. The unions and the Swedish Government objected. They took it to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Justice found in favour of the employers. When the employers and the unions in Sweden objected further and said that they might take strike action, and was that not legitimate, was that not within the rule of law, was that not a right? then the ECJ came back with the answer: yes, it is a fundamental right to strike, but not as fundamental as the right of free movement. If that is the way this project is going, it is descending into an Orwellian nightmare and will come to grief quicker, rather than later. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the Troika was invented to cope with the stagnation of growth and jobs. It has imposed austerity packages which have included reducing wages. However, trade unions have long argued that wage depression becomes dangerous. One country’s domestic demand becomes another’s export potential. Squeezing wages also squeezes demand, so imports and exports both go down. In such a closely-related trading block as the EU, that becomes a serious problem for all, as it sets in motion a downward spiral. A stable home market keeps production going and boosts exports to the rest of the world. The greatest hope, surely, is to allow those EU countries that need it to withdraw from the euro and to restart trading on a better basis. It will be hard going, but they will see the end coming into sight. Of course, to remain competitive, they will have to set their currency at a favourable rate for the export trade, and that is to devalue. In that case, wages will remain low. But what do people want: a low paid job or no job at all? For those countries most badly hit, their economies are in the hands of the unelected Troika. Can we really accept that, in an EU which keeps on emphasising its democratic credentials, we have actually seen the duly-elected Prime Ministers of two Member States usurped by the placemen of the Troika? Unless the EU returns to proper democracy, we shall not see the end of this austerity. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commissioner for Employment says that free movement of workers is a key principle of the single market, which is why, in 2004, only Sweden, Ireland and the UK exerted restrictions on 10 new Member States. The then British Home Secretary Jack Straw now says that opening borders to eastern European immigration was a spectacular mistake, while Mr[nbsp ]Barroso recently admitted that the influx of eastern Europeans was putting pressure on communities and leading to abuses in some cases. Is realism now appearing? For Croatia, 13 Member States out of 27 will use restrictions, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, while Germany and Austria will restrict posted workers. Now, will Croatians join Bulgarians and Romanians in having first call on jobs in preference to third-country nationals, as in the Commissionʼs statement of April last year? But that is discrimination, and I raised this twice in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last year and did not receive an answer. I now require a commensurate answer as to why this discrimination continues. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 In answer to the lady, I was quoting an official Commission document circulated in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in April last year, which clearly and unambiguously stated that in any competition for jobs anywhere in the EU, anybody from Bulgaria or Romania applying shall be given first choice over anybody from outside the European Union.

The lady concerned talked about my misinterpretation or the overuse of regulations, written and otherwise, by the Commission. This whole House works by the written regulations! Only recently we have had two examples in voting in this committee where a rapporteur was overturned in his request because he had not conformed to the exact written requisition that he was asking for. The whole point is that this place runs by written regulation, and I repeat, the regulation about workers from Bulgaria and Romania having pride of place over third country nationals was in a Commission document of April last year, and Mr Andor will confirm that.

 Madam President, homelessness and hopelessness lead to criminality in all too many cases, or at least to a social entrapment in which generation after generation is trapped in poverty. It threatens to become the scourge of the age. There are many causes, but one of the keys is surely employment, and one of the answers to that is surely education. I regret to say that my own government is guilty of neglect. In 1945 they introduced a scheme whereby those with academic ability could attend grammar schools, which had previously been the province of the wealthy. That offered a better way out, breaking the circle. It was the greatest social mobility scheme ever. It even benefited me, but later governments abolished it. We need an education system in Europe which caters for all abilities. We need academic schools, technical schools, commercial schools, sports academies, drama schools, universities and colleges of further education. We need industrialists to take on apprentices and send them to university at their expense, and we need those industrialists to invest in the poorer countries of Europe to help raise their standard. I do not believe in the mass migration of people across Europe promoted by this EU. We need settled communities, not footloose ones; we need people trained in a range of skills and for them, for the most part, to remain in their homelands to develop prosperity there, raising their standard of living and banishing homelessness through their own efforts. Finally, Madam President, allow me to point out that I come from country which was recently and disgracefully described by this Commissioner as a nasty country, and my final comment is: I do not wish to see poor countries in Europe.

Madam President, 9 000 people in Ireland – at Dell, Waterford Crystal and elsewhere – will be grateful for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, helping with guidance, training and education, when their firms close. Some blame cheap Chinese goods, produced through low wages, but two years ago in this House a Commission statement denied that this was true. The Commissioner said that it was China having its own central bank, setting its own interest rates and relating to world conditions so that exchange rates are helpful, resulting in goods at prices other people can afford. Instead, we have draconian measures in place to prevent individual companies establishing their own exchange rates and competing globally, promoting prosperity. At the same time, report after report comes out of this House, all imposing more regulation. The result? Higher costs, reduced sales, firms closing and moving abroad, leading to rising unemployment. And all you do is wheel out the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, trying to conceal the fact that company after company is closing under the weight of EU inflicted regulation, when you cannot even keep well-established companies going. And you call that world leadership? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the UK Health Food Manufacturers Association is non-profit. It represents 120 companies and suppliers; it has a very strong safety record and it knows that safety levels will be set well below what is regarded as safe in the UK in cases where there is no health risk. They know that only 22 additives will be allowed, meaning that potassium sorbate – a vital ingredient for vitamin D drops as recommended by our own Department of Health for children under the age of 36 months – will be banned.   GBP 100 million of sales are at risk. In the UK, over 700 health food stores will be at risk, with 4 000 jobs – all in the SME sector. Across the EU, over EUR 8 billion will be at risk: 5 000 companies and 75 000 jobs. And this report is supposed to be about more competitiveness, sustainability and an inclusive Europe.

The Commission document is a real dog’s breakfast. It lists among the regulatory instruments everything from sticking plasters to X-ray machines, taking in elbow implants, lung implants, breast implants, even presumably the metal implant in my own left ankle, which is now all metal and pieces of plastic and I am perfectly okay. The impact of this will, of course, be in over-the-counter sales, and here we have small and medium-sized enterprises at risk. You are going to drive up unemployment at a time when we already have over-unemployment; many young people out of work, when they could be working in shops selling this sort of thing. It will only produce more red tape, and the SMEs will then suffer. And who picks up the bill? Who picks up the pieces?  Why, the big pharma. They will make hay while the sun shines, when all the time everybody in the EU thinks it is all about them as individuals. It is not. It is all about the big companies. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, from Britain, from the House of Lords, our upper Chamber, I have received a note today of an inquiry they have launched into Europe’s young jobless. They note that the EU is going to spend EUR 8 billion over the next six years and they want to know if that will add any value to all these proposals. They note also that there is a brain drain in Europe and what are we going to do about it, with young people, without a job, leaving in such great numbers for work elsewhere? We all know that Spain has got something like 50% unemployed: 280 000 young people left Spain alone last year to seek their fortunes either in the rest of Europe or in South America. It is no coincidence that Spain, together with several other southern European countries, is struggling. Ireland, Portugal, Greece and others: what have they in common? The euro: a strait-jacket which is robbing them of their economy. No wonder they are in trouble; no wonder they have high youth unemployment. Let them sort out their own salvation with their own former currencies restored. It may lead to low-wage economies but then you have to answer the question: do you want a low-paid job or no job at all? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I did not vote on any of the amendments since there was no voting option to reject the granting of authority for the Commission to extract payments for emissions. Whether one voted ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to any amendment would have been to endorse the authority to extract payments. either for current emissions or for earlier emissions, ‘backloading’, or for both. I therefore voted ‘no’ to the whole proposal. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

  Mr President, I have recently been in contact with the President of the Caravan Club of Great Britain. He is most concerned about this possible new legislation. I personally am horrified. I don’t know how many other people here I speak for, but I was a caravanner for many years and belonged to the Caravan Club – not to attend their gatherings and rallys and so on, but to obtain advice and information, including tips on how to tow. I hardly use my caravan in the UK. I brought it across the Channel and had my holidays here. I’ve towed it all the way from Calais to the south of France. I’ve taken it over the Alps into Italy. I’ve gone around the Alps in Switzerland and other places, all without an accident of any description. Nor did I see one with any other caravan, and nor did I see a caravan on a caravan site which had obviously been damaged in an accident. Why? Because I took my caravan for servicing myself every year. I did not want to part company with my caravan down a German autobahn. Neither does anybody else! Do people not understand that if a caravan is not in good order and has an accident on its own, like snaking or suddenly departing from its pre-designed course, then it takes the car with it and everybody in the car will suffer injury if not death? Caravanners, in spite of what they might look like, are not mad. They will look after their caravans for the sake of their own necks. This proposed regulation is completely superfluous and I will oppose it with all my strength. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP strongly supports UK laws which seek to prevent, control or, where necessary, punish those who engage in domestic violence. The UK has developed an effective system of law to protect spouses and children from such acts. Such laws are constantly being improved. UKIP will always support sensible and workable developments in those laws. This measure allows the writ of foreign judges – who are in no way accountable to Parliament or the British people – to run the UK. A protection order made in any other Member State will be enforceable without further ado, potentially leading to imprisonment. As such this is an unacceptable infringement of the sovereign right of Parliament and the Courts to have exclusive jurisdiction over such matters according to UK law. Furthermore an order made by a foreign judge with no concept of the very real difficulties and practicabilities of the enforcement of such orders within the context of UK law will lead to grave injustices which will make those produced by the European Arrest Warrant seem tame in comparison. The UK Courts are the best forum for such matters, For those reasons we strongly oppose this measure, whilst abhorring all domestic violence. Derek Roland Clark,

Mr President, I speak from a UK perspective. We have a long and proud history of accepting people from elsewhere, especially those fleeing political and religious persecution.  In a time when there were no schools or hospitals, and electricity and public transport were non-existent, newcomers made their own way; but now they need these facilities, and we, the most densely-crowded country in the EU, are struggling to cope. That is no good for anyone, and we certainly cannot provide the social security they need. In these difficult times, we cannot provide properly for those who have been paying their taxes in the UK throughout their working lives; we cannot go on taking in people. So the suggestions in this report are impossible. Even my own government, which is in favour of the EU, is concerned that the number of proposals in this report are overly bureaucratic. We cannot regularise illegal immigrants. That would open the door to a flood of unmanageable proportions. Will the UK suddenly be expected to accept great numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians after 1 January next year? Especially after the Commission document presented to the Committee on Employment last April, which demands that Bulgarians or Romanians seeking work must be given prior claim over a third-country national. That excludes people from the British Commonwealth, who the rapporteur now thinks should go to the US instead.  It is also discrimination which is outlawed by the Lisbon Treaty. I do not think it is right to take in people for menial work; that is exploitation. Skilled workers from Eastern Europe may be welcome, but they are exactly what their own country needs to build their economy and prosperity. That is not fair. I do not want to see poor countries in Europe.  In truth, is not this report part of a programme to force people to move around the EU with financial assistance from the Commission, mixing up the peoples of Europe so that its countries disappear, to be replaced by a single state called Europe?

Mr President, note that unemployment in the EU is 10.5% of the working age population. Among the young it is averaging 28% across the EU, with nearly 50% in Greece and Spain. In the UK the overall unemployment rate is 7.7%, with youth unemployment at less than 20%. At the same time Britain is seen as unenthusiastic towards the EU. Indeed this morning, commenting on David Cameron, speakers said that we cannot take the parts we want and opt out of the rest. That is an echo of one of the first comments I heard in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs after election in 2004: ‘We do not want Member States to opt out of the Working Time Directive. That will give them an advantage’. But we did opt out – legally – of certain provisions of the WTD, leaving UK employers more free to employ workers. Is that why the UK figures are better than the EU average? Social aspects and growth improve when people have jobs. It is not therefore a question of policy coordination, but of keeping policy out of employment. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

The EU is not doing very well. Its economic growth is failing, which is what you are talking about today. The whole idea is falling apart. We are failing, and if we are not, why is it that so many firms are opting out of Europe and taking their business abroad, resulting in us having to spend millions of euros on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to make up for their shortfall? Derek Roland Clark,

. – 
Mr President, we should be concerned that growth in the EU is fading and that companies are moving abroad. Result? A great increase in the claims under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help redundant workers. That must be partly the reason for the massive budget deficit we heard about this morning. Did I hear right then? EUR 60 billion? That is taxpayers’ money.  This report speaks, among other things, of disseminating good practices, improving soft regulation processes, company disclosure of social and environmental information, emphasising the importance of national and subnational policies, and more of the same. It is about time the EU stopped generating the red tape of rules and regulations. In itself that consumes resources, so cut the red tape, reduce the business rate tax burden, and big multinationals might become more responsible, inclined to pay their tax and not avoid it. They could then concentrate on marketing their goods, generating income and retaining the workforce. And we all benefit. John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark and William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP voted against this report as it is yet more EU legislation over criminal law. The EU has no democratic right to legislate in this area and law-making should be left to elected politicians, accountable to the public, not unelected foreign Commissioners in Brussels. Of course, victims of crime should have the strongest rights and legal protection, but that is already afforded in UK law and “minimum standards” at EU level may well create a race to the bottom which makes our criminal justice system weaker. Withdrawal from the EU, European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice would be a major step forward for victims of crime seeking swift and proportional justice.

 UKIP abstained on the final vote of this report. Although there are elements to CFP reform which will give a small bit of relief to the fishing industry – and any changes to the current disastrous CFP rules is a step forward for the industry which the EU itself has destroyed – the only way we can save our stocks and fishing industry is to scrap the CFP altogether and repatriate it back to national governments accountable by the ballot box. The EU has no democratic mandate to create law in the UK and we cannot legitimise the process. UKIP did support amendments which decentralised power back to Member States and those which would cut red tape and costs to our fishing industry.

 This is an own initiative report, which is non-legislative and not binding on the EU Commission. UKIP voted against this although we do agree with ideas such as the use of selective fishing gear, the move towards discards and we share concerns over the proposed system of ‘transferable fishing concessions’ – we cannot support calls for more powers for EU fishing agencies, the creation of EU rules as to how scientists should collect data or EU propaganda campaigns aimed at schoolchildren. The CFP has been an economic and environmental disaster and we supported amendments which will help our fishing industry, but until the CFP is scrapped and fishing regulation is given back to elected governments, our fish stocks and industry will continue to suffer. Fishing regulation should be created by politicians accountable to the people by the ballot box, not the unelected Commission of the EU. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, with fish stocks in serious decline in Europe’s rich fishing grounds, the CFP is a failure. Yet these reports are laced with the same old Eurospeak – regulation, restriction, prohibit. Before the CFP, most European fishermen, unhampered by bureaucratic interference, had been fishing responsibly, looking after their own waters and therefore handing on viable fisheries down the generations. But the EU destroyed this culture of care and so now we have rules about total permissible catch and the wretched discard policy, which has decimated stocks. If you do not like lessons from the past, then try the present. Norway and Iceland still record good catches and find many species spawning well, but then they ban discards and other destructive EU measures which, as noted in these reports, have reduced EU fishing fleets. The UK fishing fleet is barely half its former size and so much of the fish sold in the UK now comes from Iceland. What an indictment of the CFP.

– Madam President, I do not believe that spending more taxpayers’ money will solve the growing problem of youth unemployment. Nor are grand plans and schemes, like the EU Youth opportunities initiative, the answer, for these have nothing to offer. To tackle a problem resulting from its own policies, the EU is proposing another expensive Commission programme. Rather, we should stop taking money from small businesses in particular, and remove the red tape burden from SMEs, which are the employers of half the workforce. That will free their businesses up and allow them to employ young people, reducing unemployment. We should reduce taxes on big business in return for them taking on young people in apprenticeships and training. With this kind of stimulus, they will prosper as their trainees, becoming more productive in years to come, plough their skills back in. For businesses offer actual practice and training, forming the habit of working and taking home money which has been earned, creating the dignity of providing for oneself, which can only help society. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

Blue-card answer. 
– It was not me that said this first. It was Commissioner Barroso himself who, just under two years ago, said in this House that red tape was strangling small businesses. I have since asked the Commissioner twice what he is going to do about removing or reducing red tape. I get no answer. As for what I mean, I mean all the petty, small regulations which so hamper small businesses and drive some of them to the wall and some of them to distraction as the owner sits up late at night completing this form or that form or accounting for this penny or that penny. No, it is not the complete answer; nothing ever is. But it would be a jolly good start if small businesses in particular were freed of much of this red tape so they could get on with the job of doing what they are doing and then, because they have got more capital to spend, employ young people and help youth unemployment.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the EFF has EUR 4.5 billion to spend on fishing over the period 2007 to 2013 covering scrapping of fishing vessels, aquaculture, inland fishing, sustainability and administration of the fund. But fishing managed very well before the CFP was introduced, livings were made, fish was plentiful. Since its inception in 1973, the CFP has introduced rules and regulations to control fishing. Now the EFF – why? After all, fishermen have been plying their trade for centuries without all this, and a viable industry has been passed down the generations. Fishermen are not stupid. They have looked after their stocks, just as a farmer looks after his livestock and land. This proposal, of course, is a backdoor way of giving extra financial support to countries which have been bailed out, bailout funds under the EFSM will trigger this extra support from the EFF, and yet more taxpayers’ money goes down the drain. So this whole scheme, purporting to help fishing with more funds, is really an addition to bailouts, which are supposed to be loans by way of bond issues with time limits for repayment. Does that mean that the extra EFF money will not be included in bailout repayments? Does it mean that cash will be available without issuing bonds? If so, EFF funding will be a gift to offset a debt. What kind of finance is that? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, with the Greek and Italian debt crises under the burden of the euro, of course unemployment is rising. Spain has over 40% youth unemployment – yet there is a call for more Europe. Employment policy should be to cut regulations by half at least as the target for 2020, instead of which more legislation is being proposed. If you want growth and jobs, stop promoting the failed euro. Look at what it has done to Greece. Set them and others free, free to reorganise their own currency and to set their own interest rates. Remember the euro forerunner, the ERM? My country was in that project; interest rates rose and so did unemployment. Finally, interest rates went up to 15% – totally unsustainable – but at least the government came to its senses and withdrew from the ERM. That was on Black Wednesday in 1992, but it should be remembered as ‘Freedom Wednesday’, for interest rates fell, employment gradually recovered and we entered a period of economic growth. Now that is the model you want. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, how many men does it take to change a light bulb? In one English council, tenants must send for council staff, who may not use ladders, only scaffolding. That is three people: one holds the rigging, one changes the bulb and one supervises. That is the crazy English, but I do have better examples. At a meeting six years ago, I was astonished to hear of the number of young people injured at work. The independent body – unconnected with the EU – which had called the meeting suggested a range of safe practices which they claimed had reduced these figures – without legislation. As I have said before, good ideas always spread, and a Latvian took these documents to use locally. But the EU legislates; we do it every day. Why – if good results can be achieved by unbiased advice from non-political sources? So I ask that elements of this draft report, such as simplifying existing legislation, implementing national strategies and adjusting to the context of Member States, carry through to the final, advisory version. Voluntary systems are always best: no infringement proceedings. Derek Roland Clark,

. – Mr President, the CFP was only introduced in 1973, when the UK joined the common market. Up to then, UK fishermen had looked after their fisheries so well, without all these regulations, that other profligate Member States wanted a slice of our action. The result? Illegal fishing. Any system of complex rules and regulations produces cheats – that is human nature. Now you want to duplicate our coastguard and to consider more rules to combat possible illegal recreational fishing. Does the EU never stop meddling? To preserve fish stocks, Member States must be responsible for their own fishing waters up to the 200-mile limit or the median line. Bilateral arrangements would be up to them and they would have to protect their own fish stocks in their own interests, under their laws and their enforcement. Norway does just that. Stocks have recovered, especially the spawning stocks of several species – but then Norway is not in the EU and does not have to obey its crazy rules. It bans discards, requiring that all fish caught be landed. Meanwhile, EU stocks are seriously depleted. I know thought is being given to discards, but after 38 years of waste, will our stocks recover? As to combating illegal fishing globally, the EU’s discard policy is the greatest illegal fishing scandal of all! That – and licensing European fleets to raid the waters of the third world, reducing those people to poverty – is what I call illegal. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, to quote from your own documents, ‘national and local events will take place in every EU Member State’ – awareness-raising campaigns, workshops, school indoctrination and so on. The documents also say that this is mainly the responsibility of the Member State. No EU money is forthcoming, so it is Member States’ money. How do those countries most in need manage that? Only last month, this House voted to raise the take from Member States by 5%. Of a hundred budget lines, some 20 were for a reduction. With like-minded MEPs, I supported those – which would have saved European taxpayers EUR 100 million – but was outvoted by most of you on all except two lines, so only EUR 1 million was saved. If people keep more of their earnings, they spend more, helping other businesses to keep going and helping employment. So Member States who really need help for this programme will not get it. Where will they find the money? You have already raided their bank balances for bailout funds. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, we have been here before. Remember the Lisbon Agenda – the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world leading to more and better jobs, a 10-year programme which started in 2000? Where is it? It failed, of course: simply because you keep on thinking you can solve a problem by central decree. Sorry, it does not work that way. Such programmes need a written plan, and then rules and regulations, and there we go: straight into the red tape jungle. If you could only understand that: cut the red tape and all the restrictive regulations, and let people get on with what they do best – making things and selling them. Once again, I must remind you that big business can cope with red tape and can afford compliance officers and well-paid lawyers to bail them out if they make a mistake. SMEs, which employ half the workforce, do not have those resources, so when they get into trouble, they fold. Another one or two jobs go, and fewer youngsters are taken on to learn a trade. Take this morning’s farce in the vote on tyres for motor vehicles and trailers – not really a farce: it is another headache for the motor trade. For how many small garages will this be the last straw before they go under? This whole agenda is another one-size-fits-all idea, or rather, one-size-that-fits-no one. The euro is one of those: now falling apart before your eyes, and all you can think of is to try more of the same. The first casualties of that disaster are, of course, the SMEs – and more jobs are lost. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, I would like to ask the Minister how he can justify this proposal to treble maternity pay by requiring firms to pay new mothers their full salary for 20 weeks. Does he not know we are in the middle of one of the worst recessions of modern times? This will present businesses with the prospect of a 2 billion burden. Even my government opposes this move. In addition, Minister, you plan to extend minimum parental leave from three months to four months for each parent. That is separate from the maternity leave, with one month of the four not transferable to the other parent. Is the Council prepared to compromise on main issues like the duration of maternity leave and the level of payment? Otherwise, you intend to give Member States two years to amend their laws – though how you can say ‘their’ laws, I do not know. This comes straight from the Commission factory, and we shall oppose this job-destroying proposal. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was invented to persuade Member States to adopt Lisbon without national referendums, but this expensive project has insufficient checks. In Antwerp, General Motors claimed EUR 9.5 million from the EGAF. Their redundant workers received EUR 150 000 each and then some found work with Volvo nearby. Of the five countries with negative growth, three have put in no claims, while stronger economies have, with Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria leading the way, and several more this week. Many firms are closing due to trade moving to the Far East. Glasfiber in Denmark closed because their manufacturer of wind turbines moved to China. This does not happen just because Chinese workers are on low pay; indeed, on Tuesday in this House, the Commissioner discounted that. More to the point, what he said was that China’s central bank sets its own interest rates, while the exchange rates make Chinese products more attractive on world markets. EU manufacturers will struggle on world markets if euro membership makes their products too expensive – ask Greece! Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Rio +20 Earth Summit 2012 sounds important – but is it really? The Socialist one-world agenda has been having a hard time of it of late. Global problems require global solutions: sounds good. But global governance through scare stories about man-made global warming has fallen flat. People in the UK, US and China are hugely disbelieving. Everybody knows that CO2
 is not the cause of the ice ages coming and going. So how can a little extra CO2
 be a problem now, whether or not it causes a little extra global warning? Is not a little warming a good thing? Would anyone here really prefer icebergs in the Channel and polar bears in Brussels? The same goes for the even more vague scare stories that have been peddled using meaningless rhetoric since Rio twenty years ago. No one knows what sustainable development really means – and who would want unsustainable development anyway? The environmentalists’ ‘ban everything accept windmills’ attitude is going to send us back to the Middle Ages unless we put a stop to it. You are calling in this document for tangible actions and accountable targets, but of course that is all just Soviet five-year plans all over again. It is about time we recognised these failed Communist policies for what they are and go back to the honest free-market approach which creates wealth for all by innovation and hard work, not by endless interfering and political tinkering.

 – Madam President, yet another expensive, bureaucratic monster arises by combining VIS, SIS and Eurodac, whether or not any Member State currently participates in these agencies. It is meant to develop Schengen, which itself is under pressure due to the Libyan situation. What is the use of a system to allow free movement which has to be partially suspended because of the free movement it encourages? I understand there will be a central agency to retain fingerprints and biometric records for five years, including material obtained under SIS – ‘information regarding certain categories of persons and property’. So, under the guise of facilitating the free movement of people, we have a resurrection of the Stasi. Of course, this is intended to lead to EU immigration control. In the case of the UK, many immigrants come from the Commonwealth, a unique voluntary association including every single one of our former colonies. Well, we have our own border controls for that purpose, and the EU does not have the right to interfere. Derek Roland Clark,

 Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues. In the UK in May 2008, the Misleading Marketing Regulations came into force. They outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service. So the Office of Fair Trading can now take action against UK companies, but there is a serious drawback. The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints. More to the point, while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing, why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland Europe? The answer to that lies at the heart of this useless EU, which has demolished national frontiers. The free movement of people, goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers, the terrorists and for threatening, traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary.

– I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments. UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent, have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy. Unfortunately, the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

What do we need expensive promotions for? As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: ‘United in Diversity’. Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire?

– Mr President, this review’s 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market, but the eurozone is collapsing, so how can it provide more opportunities? It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets. What growth? In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio. I got no answers then, but now it seems I have some. The review’s five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations. The first principle of the review – creating a right environment – should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids. It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred. After all, Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year: ‘red tape is strangling SMEs’. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– As a UKIP MEP, I am against any kind of EU interference in the UK system of asylum and in any related directive which would force EU rules on the UK. I therefore abstained on votes to all amendments because I will not accept even those that might be seen to be helpful; this is a matter for the UK alone. I therefore voted against the amended proposal and against the legislative resolution. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr President, after 30 years, the destructive practice of discards is to be addressed. Fleets at Grimsby are a few dozen fishing boats, where once there were a hundred. Two years ago West of Scotland fishermen tabled a plan to conserve white fish but, while they wait, stock depletion continues. A regional approach is suggested – why not? The EU divides the land into regions. Much worse is the renewal of licences for European fleets to raid the waters of the Comoros islands – and raid it will be, for local fishermen cannot compete with the superior EU-powered trawlers. The same thing has been done to others in that area. Is the House surprised that Somali fishermen denied a living have resumed the age-old vice of piracy? Five years ago, did Members see the TV pictures of hundreds of Western Saharans trying to seek refuge in the Canaries? EU licences had just been renewed for their waters and they too had seen it all before. In a pitiful, desperate attempt many died on the 800-mile journey in fishing boats never intended for the open sea. However, the EU does not care that people from the least-developed countries have been impoverished by its actions and, for that, it deserves to be condemned. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report claims that European solidarity and economic development will be threatened by a reduction of the budget. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory – that is why I voted against a freeze – when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break. Derek Roland Clark,

– Mr President, this goes beyond Ireland. Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms. Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages? I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States. It is all very well to say that ‘equal’ must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU? As an example, think ‘climate’: keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries. Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others. Of course wages cannot be equal. The Commission’s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties. I am not surprised: this is the EU at work. A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal. Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, my point of order regards the first two votes we have today on the calendar for next year and the year after. I have two points to raise, if you please. First of all, these votes simply illustrate how powerless this Parliament really is. Everybody here thinks they are getting more and more power, and more and more influence. But, in point of fact, these amendments are simply to get round the fact that we are obliged to have 12 part-sessions … (The President cut off the speaker) Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this question mentions a territorial dimension with reference to other policies, including the CFP, which is a complete EU disaster. Fish stocks in the North Sea, part of the Atlantic, have been ruined by discards, which must be abolished. They should never have been contemplated in the first place. UK fishermen have carefully looked after fish stocks in their own territorial waters while others have ruined theirs by overfishing. No wonder the CFP was welcomed by other Member States, whose fishermen could not wait to get into the North Sea. One needs more territorial exclusion, not less. In my own region – the East Midlands – the fishermen of Boston have fished the Wash for generations, looking after the fish stocks and making sure that their trawl nets do not disturb the sea bed, for they know that this is where the immature shellfish develop and that this is where the creatures form the bottom of the food chain. This is their livelihood. Now they are forbidden to fish, on the pretext that their trawls damage the sea bottom. Meanwhile, a Dutch vessel is licensed to hoover up a million tonnes of gravel from the same sea bed, while E.ON is to dig a trench right through to the open sea to lay the line for a useless offshore wind farm. How much damage will all that do to the sea bed? How much longer will these fishermen be forced to stand by and watch their fishing grounds reduced to nothing while they are reduced to being benefit claimants? Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 22 November last year, the rapporteur said that pensions were exclusively a competence of the Member State. Now this has become something more like: although Member States have the lead, there are aspects where coordination at European level is important. In paragraph 9, the resolution stresses Member States’ competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies. There is double speak here, with EU control overturning principle. The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive – by 90% according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall. If that is exaggerated, it is certainly true that huge extra sums will be needed to prevent pensions collapsing, so premiums will rise massively. Pension firms and Member States do not need this report; they need help to keep premiums down. Otherwise, this misguided report has the potential to destroy that which it seeks to protect.

 The UK Independence Party fully supports the cause of genuine human rights. However, we note that the EU’s interpretation of human rights is a flawed one.

This is why we cannot support this measure. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, I am happy to read this speech on behalf of Mr Bloom, who has – in my view – been unfairly debarred from the Chamber this afternoon. We had a fiasco a year ago in Copenhagen, when 15 000 unqualified people, including MEPs and the whole entourage, descended on the place to double its carbon footprint for a fortnight and got hopelessly embroiled in climategate, which was very neatly timed to scotch the proceedings. Yes, we all remember the University of East Anglia getting shown for what it is: a centre of bogus science churned out by bought and paid-for scientists who rely on the EU’s Research DG and the UN’s ‘super quango’ for research funds and laboratories and on the UK taxpayers for their wages. They were shown up as forgers of data, forgers of climate computer models, hiders of inconvenient data and conspirators with Obama’s green minions. The taxpaying masses learned in no uncertain terms that the EU and the global green agenda is all about raising our carbon taxes and scaring us into compliance. Cancún would be not nearly as bad, of course. It is much warmer. It is a jolly winter, and the conspirators will be much more careful to hide their global governance agenda this year.

– Considering the illegitimacy, undemocratic structure, corruption and megalomaniac ulterior motivation of the European Union in general and the Commission, in particular, we of the UKIP cannot condone the Commission’s monopolisation of public funds for any purpose whatever and believe, consequently, that any monies it directs to the repair of last year’s flood damage in Ireland will not be properly used and will merely conceal the need for relief funding that is correctly disbursed and directed by democratically elected governments. Gerard Batten, John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark, Trevor Colman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries, as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines. However, in this case, the EU is making special arrangements for governments, outside of normal State aid rules, for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines. Amendment 25 and 36 are calling for a greater period of such flexibility before normal State aid laws would apply, which UKIP can go some way to support. UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because, although we do not support any EU State aid laws because it should be up to national governments to decide on subsidy levels, giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable, putting power back in to the hands of governments to make these decisions.

– I voted against the Gauzès report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom’s most important industry – financial services. It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive, from investment trusts to hedge funds, in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation. It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors. This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU. As usual, EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players. By punishing private equity funds, it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy. It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments. The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital. Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, poverty, especially the number of those at risk of poverty, has grown as the EU has grown, with each new Member State adding to the problem, so it is pretty obvious how to prevent further increases. One of your answers is to introduce a minimum income. I am in favour of a minimum wage, but only as set by each country for itself. A pan-EU minimum wage would distort the issue. In Scandinavia, for example, domestic heating must be more expensive for all income groups than in southern Europe. I oppose a minimum income because that means public funds to top up a low wage: more for the taxpayer to find in an economic crisis. How do you stop some employers paying less than they might because they know the benefit system will make it up? Answer: more regulations and red tape for businesses, falling most heavily on the SMEs who, between them, employ half the workforce. And, of course, minimum income harmonised across the EU will be followed by a harmonised tax system, reducing all to a grey amorphous mass, devoid of Europe’s greatest property: diversity. Derek Roland Clark,

 Mr President, what is the Commissioner thinking about? Has the Commission been asleep for the last two years? Here we are, at a time of economic stringency, despite what Mr Van Rompuy said this week. There are millions out of work, some newer Member States have still not got the promised financial package, and Germany has a billion-euro bill round its neck to underwrite the Greek economy. In Britain, my government is raising taxes, freezing public sector pay and pensions and cutting back on welfare while finding GBP 45 million every day for this place. And now you want to spend EUR 1.1 billion of hard pressed European taxpayers’ money on a programme to help partner countries along the EU borders. Is that what you mean by more Europe – or is it an attempt to draw these countries into the EU? It sounds like empire-building to me. After all, José Barroso himself called this an empire. We are told that the EU is to prevent further wars in Europe, but if you look at the record you will find that such wars were due to the empire-builders. Now you are doing it all over again. Do you never learn? John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, the only guideline is for the EU to stop interfering. The Working Time Directive is a disincentive to work. Why cannot you let people work overtime when they want to? Please do not tell me that this is to protect workers from exploitation, when the EU’s puppet court, the ECJ, has ruled in favour of companies exploiting groups of workers by paying them less than a minimum wage in no less than four countries. Are you aware that more than a fifth of newly qualified junior doctors in the UK are turned down because the WTD means they lack experience and that more are dropping out of training for the same reason? This House passed a report on independent truck drivers recently which will result in many of them packing it in. In voting today, MEPs have approved a paragraph in the Bové report – which will add a massive reporting burden to SMEs – hours after President Barroso had complained that SMEs were being strangled by red tape. The EU is the problem, not the answer, as the people of Europe are beginning to realise. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP voted against the Alvaro report today because we do not want to give the EU greater power over personal data. This measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy. Confidential and private financial data belongs to the individual and not to the EU or the European Parliament. We are resolutely opposed to the spread of terrorism, but personal confidentiality must be protected where there is no prior suggestion of wrong-doing. If the UK is to enter into an agreement with the US it must be a fully reciprocal arrangement and not the almost one-way-traffic one that the EU has signed up to here.

 I abstained on the vote on Amendment 80 because, while the case for national governments to scrutinise the control of EEAS must be guaranteed, this amendment also guaranteed the right of the European Parliament to do the same.

– UKIP voted against Amendments 1 and 29 so as to restore the Commission’s intention to exclude independent drivers from this directive. We believe that requiring independent drivers to account for the time spent arranging their schedules and bidding for new business will be impossible to monitor, especially when this is done at home, as well as using part of their allocated maximum working hours per week. This will result in less driving, causing them to become less competitive and resulting in unemployment. UKIP also believes in the freedom of individuals to set up in business and to work for themselves, but this directive will prevent that from taking place. Since this is not a health and safety issue, the only winners will be big businesses. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer report in the European Parliament because it is badly drafted, with inadequate definitions. The country of origin statement was badly worded, giving rise to confusion. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers and consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the public. UKIP believes MEPs are acting without sufficient information on this matter. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, it is essential that Amendment 30, with special regard to paragraph 7(a), be adopted. Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions. It is not a road safety issue. All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph. Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency. Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business. If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers. Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector. The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce. I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect. You do not hear that very often from this part of the House.

– UKIP regards the safety of nuclear power generation as being of great importance, but perceives the EU’s assistance to Bulgaria, ostensibly for this purpose, as being motivated by political considerations (preventing the reprocessing of fissile material, conveniently close to Bulgaria, in neighbouring Russia) and doctrinaire ones (the imposition of unrealistic wind-power policies) as well as by a desire to fund local conservation projects, which are not relevant to the remit of decommissioning. Consequently, UKIP members have voted against the extra funding asked for in this report. John Bufton  (EFD

– We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean. This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa.

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level? Universities have shared information with each other for centuries, before the EU existed. The Renaissance, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, was a surge in intellectual development spreading from Florence right across Europe through the universities. The arts, music, literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today. So what of modernisation? Do you look for the technological developments of the future? If so, the scene today is just as promising. Universities elsewhere may be overtaking us, but they owe their beginnings to European universities. This tide of higher education often returns home. The universities of Britain take postgraduate students from across the world, pursuing their studies further and sharing their information, not least with commerce and industry. But we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the Bologna and the Erasmus processes. We do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other ‘-ism’, that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus. If you wish to serve the modern and future worlds, see that universities are funded properly, encourage those students who wish to study abroad, then simply leave them all alone to get on with it.

– Madam President, in anticipation of your calling the next vote on the Lehne report on deontology, may I please ask why this vote is being taken? It was due for debate last night under catch-the-eye. That was cancelled, so here we are voting on something which has not been debated, although it does not say so. For your information, Madam President, when this came before the Employment Committee a short while ago, nobody on that committee knew what deontology meant until I tried to explain it to them – not even the Chair! I think it is highly improper, therefore, to take a vote on this unknown, undebated motion. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the report on simplification of the CAP because, although the implementation of the report would make the policy more comprehensible, transparent and workable, simplifying farm inspection, adding to flexibility to payment arrangements and making it more farmer friendly, to do so is to keep the CAP on track and potentially help to extend it for another generation!

It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability.

Unaccountable EU bureaucrats, instead of elected politicians leading the negotiations, will end up with a bad outcome for Iran and the rest of the world. Negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments, not forced upon from above by the EU.

– Mr President, like charity, rights begin at home. I ask about the rights of Europeans Sikhs. Because they wear the kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger, beneath their clothing, they have been prevented from entering the European Parliament. The kirpan is an act of faith which they may not remove, so their exclusion is a matter of religious and racial intolerance. In successive years, I have written to each of the two previous Presidents and the Commission who all replied that the exclusion is on security grounds. In celebrating her diamond jubilee, Queen Elizabeth came to my region, the East Midlands, where in their place of worship in Leicester, she talked to Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan, standing as close to them as you are to your colleagues. I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago, I was at the Palace of Westminster. There, in our democratic parliament, very close to both the House of Lords and to the House of Commons, I met several Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan. With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know. His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears, fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours. As a result, you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place. So what of the Lisbon Treaty which speaks of a Union founded on respect for freedom, equality, the rights of minorities, values of non-discrimination?

In particular, this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol, agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, I could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains my vote on the subject. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Thursday 17April is the 30th anniversary of the murder of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher in London. She was killed in a hail of shots into a crowd from the Libyan Embassy. The murderer has so far not been brought to justice. Information has come to light that a suspect living in Jordan has confessed to the murder and his identity is known to the British security services and to the Metropolitan Police. So far, no action has been taken by the British authorities to question him and, if the evidence so demands, to request his extradition from Jordan to face trial. Contrary to popular belief, most of those in the Libyan Embassy at the time did not have diplomatic immunity and the suspect is not protected. PC Yvonne Fletcher deserves justice and the British authorities must now make every effort to bring her murderer to justice without further delay. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the Stockholm Programme includes the objective of constructing an EU system of criminal law. It is laughable that the EU should presume to create an area of so-called freedom, security and justice in England. The English already did that for themselves over the last 800 years and it served as a model for much of the civilised world. That system is now being subverted because of our subordination to an inferior continental system. This report euphemistically refers to the various so-called imbalances within the emerging EU system. These imbalances are caused by the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition which states that all EU Member Statesʼ police, judicial and penal systems are of equal value. This is absolute nonsense and is causing a growing number of cases of gross injustice. To protect ourselves, Britain must leave the European Union. And to bring that day forward the British can vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the EU intends to create a Public Prosecutor’s Office with vast legal powers across the Member States. The British Government has already announced that it will opt out of the public prosecutor scheme. However, the Government has already announced that it intends to permanently opt in to the 35 EU police and criminal justice measures. As I said here last month, those 35 measures are the most important and the most dangerous to our traditional freedoms and liberties. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the Government’s decision to opt out of the Public Prosecutor’s Office is both worthless and dishonest. The Prosecutorʼs Office will have at their disposal the use of all the existing legal instruments, such as the European Arrest Warrant, and the new ones, such as the European Investigation Order. Although the Prosecutorʼs Office will have no direct authority in the UK, it will have de facto power by means of the use of these legal instruments. The Tory-led coalition Government knows it cannot defend accepting the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the UK, so it seeks to achieve the same thing by the back door. There is still time for the Government to reverse its decision and opt out of the 35 measures. But to fully protect ourselves, we have to leave the European Union. To do that, vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

  We hear a lot about fundamental rights in this place. In England we had very good fundamental rights long before we joined the European Union. These were established over centuries under Habeas corpus
, the Bill of Rights, the presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt, to name just a few. These safeguards are now being destroyed by the creation of the EU’s own system of criminal justice. The European Arrest Warrant has been the cause of numerous cases of gross injustice, and these will continue to grow. Now we have the European Investigation Order, which will empower foreign police forces to require British police forces to carry out investigations on their behalf, which we will then have the privilege of paying for. The coalition government has the option to opt out of the existing 135 EU criminal justice measures. Instead it has announced its decision to opt out of 100 but opt in to 35. The 100 they are opting out of are of no consequence, being purely rhetorical, redundant or superseded by later legislation. The 35 measures they are opting in to are the worst and most dangerous, including the European Arrest Warrant. None of this is necessary, because there are already existing mutual assistance measures in place that allow police forces and judicial systems to cooperate with each other across national borders. This is not about cooperation. It is about harmonising our legal system in pursuit of the great ideological goal of a United States of Europe. If David Cameron is serious about repatriating power from the EU, he has the golden opportunity to do so now. There is still time to change the decision and opt out of all these measures, thereby protecting the real interests and freedoms of the British people. But I fear the Tories will do what they always do and sell their fellow countrymen down the river to the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Claude, can I ask you to retract something that you said in that speech? You referred to the Crete case and Mr[nbsp ]Hughes and you said that his attackers are on trial in Greece. No, those accused of attacking him are on trial in Greece and they are innocent until proved guilty. Some of them have alibis showing that they were not even present at the place where the attack took place. Nevertheless the lack of evidence against them has not stopped them being extradited. I know that you are a very fair man so would you like to retract the word ‘attacker’ and say ‘accused’ instead? Gerard Batten  (EFD

blue-card question
. –
 Sarah, you spoke about the excessive length of pre-trial detention and I would agree with you: that is to be avoided. But would you agree that one of the reasons for this is because, when people are extradited to Britain, the police must be case-ready. They have to have a case fully prepared to go to trial before they can extradite somebody. Whereas under some continental systems investigative judges may hold people while they investigate, which results in sometimes weeks, months or years of them being detained. Would you agree with me that every police force in the European Union should be case-ready before they request somebody’s judicial surrender? Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, this report calls for a directive which will allow judicial authorities to confiscate someone’s assets without a criminal conviction. What happened to the presumption of innocence until proved guilty? The bedrock of the English constitution is the Bill of Rights, 1689. It clearly says ‘that grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before convictions are illegal and void’. That means that no government or judicial authority can impose a fine or take away someone’s property for an alleged criminal activity, but must first secure a criminal conviction in a court of law. The Bill of Rights is a constitutional act and is still in force. Our freedoms and liberties are being eroded and destroyed, and the pretext is always the same: that we have to be protected from crime and terrorism. But the single biggest reason for the increased threat of crime in the UK and Europe is the EU’s open borders policy. Open borders mean that we cannot stop criminals – big and small, organised and disorganised – from coming to our country. Indeed, it will be illegal under the EU’s freedom of movement directives to discriminate against criminals. All UK MEPs should vote against this report. If a directive is adopted, then the British Government should unilaterally refuse to transpose it into UK law. It would be illegal and void. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, on the one hand, it is good for once to be able to agree with the report in that it opposes the merging of the European Police College and Europol. On the other hand, UK Independence Party MEPs cannot vote for it because it calls for yet more powers to be given to Europol. This report wants to increase Europolʼs powers to participate in the investigative and judicial proceedings of Member States.  Europol is of course the European Union’s emerging cross-border police force – the United States of Europe’s own FBI – but there is no need for it, or to enlarge its powers. Bilateral agreements between nation states are a far cheaper and more effective way of achieving the desired results, and by these means nations can retain democratic control and accountability over their own police forces.  Existing mechanisms and Interpol already exist to provide cooperation between the police forces of nation states. Few people in Britain realise that Europol officers have immunity for anything that they do or say in the course of their duties. Such immunity is a concept unknown under English law, where it is a centuries-old principle that no one is above the law. We need genuine cooperation between nation states, police and judicial authorities. We do not need a European police force, leading eventually to a European police state. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Madam President, on 10[nbsp ]February an article by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown appeared in The Independent
 newspaper. The headline described certain people as ‘hideously white’, while the text included a description of them as ‘pompous, backward and white’. These derogatory descriptions associated with race would appear to be an offence under the Race Relations Act. On that basis I have written to the Metropolitan Police.  The Independent 
is, I believe, on sale on the continent. If an EU citizen outside the United Kingdom complained about the article then Mrs Alibhai-Brown could find herself the subject of a European arrest warrant issued under the category of racism and xenophobia. She could find herself locked up for a considerable amount of time on the order of an investigating magistrate while the case is looked into. I would, of course, oppose her judicial surrender under a European arrest warrant as being contrary to the principles of English law. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, this morning President Barroso restated the European Union’s commitment to open borders as a fundamental principle. A sensible immigration policy in Britain would allow entry only to those people we might actually want: people with the skills to fill jobs that genuinely cannot be filled by our own unemployed; people who have a legitimate right to marry British citizens; people who are hardworking and law abiding. Instead, what has the EU given us? We also get criminals, drug addicts, alcoholics, beggars, vagrants and benefit-seekers. Decent British people see their living standards being driven down, while benefits and social housing are given to people who have never paid a penny in tax in the UK. That is what the EU has delivered for us, and next May the voters of Britain will deliver their verdicts on you, fellow Members, when they vote for the UK Independence Party in massive numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the subject of public procurement brings to mind the problems with the Brussels hemicycle. The hemicycle was, of course, closed in September 2012 because cracks were discovered in three of the beams holding up the roof. In December 2012 we were told that Parliament was having difficulty in finding a builder to do the repair work. This was, apparently, because they were concerned about the ten-year guarantee required. If the Chamber is reopened in April, as promised, it will have been closed for 18 months. Surely Parliament’s public procurement procedures should have been able to find a builder willing to do the work, given that money is no problem? Some might suspect that the long delay was deliberate, in order to prevent the Brussels Chamber being used as the sole meeting place of this Parliament, thereby ending the monthly and expensively monstrous trek to Strasbourg. If Parliament cannot organise its own public procedure policies, how can it possibly hope to organise everybody else’s? Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, some of you in Europe may need an area of freedom, security and justice. We already had one in England under our Constitution, our common law, protected by such things as the presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, the trial by jury and under the Bill of Rights. These are now being superseded and overridden by the EU creating its own system of civil and criminal law.  Any British citizen can now be carted off to any other EU Member State purely on the strength of a piece of paper: the infamous European Arrest Warrant. All of these rest on the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition, which says that any EU legal system is equal to any other EU legal system. This is obvious nonsense. The British Government had the opportunity to opt out of 135 of these measures in mid-2014; instead, it intends to opt into the 35 worst and most dangerous. Mr Cameron could have genuinely repatriated some powers; instead, he is going to hand to the EU on a plate powers that endanger all our traditional, centuries-old liberties and freedoms.

 Madam President, this report marks another step on the way to the European Union having its own armed forces. The Treaty on European Union of 1992 laid down the foundations for a common security and defence policy leading to a common defence. Common defence means only one thing: common armed forces, a European army. That goal is being steadily pursued by means of common procurement procedures, common communications systems and common command and control structures.  The British armed forces are being deliberately run down so that their resulting weaknesses can be used as an excuse for eventually merging them into a common EU army. The British army now has fewer soldiers than the German army had after the Versailles Treaty. Meanwhile, they are stretched to breaking point and expected to perform miracles. If Britain’s service men and women understand the writing on the wall, then they will vote en masse
 for the United Kingdom Independence Party. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

I do not think that this actually matters, because ever since I first sat in this Chamber in 2004 – and I spent the first four or five years on the Subcommittee on Security and Defence – it has been obvious that this is the goal that is being pursued. How many other constitutions have been overridden and changed in order to accommodate EU integration? Our own constitution in England is overridden and set aside by what is happening in the European Union, so I do not think they are going to worry about a few other smaller countries’ constitutions when pursuing their ultimate goal.

 Mr President, the regional development funds are some of the most expensive items in the EU budget. These schemes are often just a waste of money, but a waste of money used to promote the EU’s identity as a political state. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has also been a gift to organised crime. In Bulgaria, the mafia profited massively from ERDF funding being channelled into projects in which they have financial stakes. And now the criminals of candidate countries are keen to get in on the action too. The ERDF is a key part of EU propaganda. Legal requirements say that EU flags and placards must be fixed in places where the money has been spent, but there is no such thing as EU money. There is only taxpayers’ money. Member States would be better off spending their own money in their own way in a democratically accountable manner. Britain cannot afford this and it is yet another reason why Britain has to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, in his book In Praise of Folly
, Erasmus castigates various establishment groups of his day, and it still makes amusing reading 500 years later. In his criticism of theologians he says: ‘They will proclaim me a heretic. With this thunderbolt they terrify the people they don’t like. Their opinion of themselves is so great that they behave as if they were already in heaven; they look down pityingly on other men as so many worms. A wall of imposing definitions, conclusions, corollaries, and explicit and implicit propositions protects them. They are full of big words and newly-invented terms.’ It is unintended irony, surely, to associate the name of Erasmus with the European Union, the greatest folly of our age. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, by its nature, citizenship can only be of a political state. All British citizens were made citizens of the European Union in 1993 without their consent. Few realise that this also includes our supposedly sovereign Head of State, Her Majesty The Queen. Under the still-existing English Constitution, the Head of State cannot be subject to a higher political authority. The English monarch is the physical embodiment of the sovereignty of the nation, and that is the fundamental problem at the heart of British membership of the European Union. The British people still imagine that they are a free and sovereign people, and yet they are not. The issue can only be resolved by them, by a democratic decision accepting their new status as a region of the European Union, or by leaving and re-establishing our national democratic independence.

Mr President, if people have been illegally transported across European borders by the CIA, then that is wrong. Every criminal suspect is entitled to open justice and a fair trial. However, this oral question is not about that. It is about asking the Commission to introduce more measures to bring national security services under its control. The public can read more about this plan in the Commission’s own document entitled ‘European Security Strategy: A secure Europe in a better world’, published as part of the Stockholm programme.  These proposals are just another step along the road to creating a United States of Europe. Just as the EU now has its own foreign policy and is taking control of Member States’ armed forces, so it needs control of their security services to complete the picture. The EU does not yet have the power to do that and we must ensure that it never does. Gerard Batten,

Madam President, in the previous debate, Commissioner Malmström, if I heard her correctly, said that she wanted to open up more legal avenues for migration into Europe. Mrs Malmström, why do you not go to countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain and ask ordinary people how they feel about that? I imagine that the vast majority would tell you that they are ‘immigrationed out’ and that they actually want fewer – not more – waves of people coming to their country. Maybe you should try stepping outside of the Brussels ideological bubble and, dare I use the term, show some solidarity with the ordinary working people of Europe. You talk here about border controls, but you have no intention whatsoever of actually trying to control immigration. Britain is swamped by continual waves of immigration from outside and inside the European Union and the only way we can control that is to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, between 1958 and 1962 tens of thousands of women gave birth to babies with severe birth defects, including missing limbs. The cause of this was the drug Thalidomide, prescribed to pregnant women. In the UK there are about 467 surviving victims. As they age, their health problems are made worse by their disabilities. Some compensation was paid by the Distillers Company Ltd, the UK distributors, but the German inventor of the drug, Grünenthal, has never properly accepted its responsibilities or paid compensation to the British victims. The compensation the victims did receive is now inadequate to meet the rising costs of their care.  The survivors are an extraordinary group of brave, resilient and independent people. All they want is for Grünenthal to face up to its responsibilities and to arrive at a fair settlement. Please register your support for the Thalidomide victims’ campaign by going to their website http://www.showyourhand.org" . This gross injustice has gone on for 50 years too long. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, it has long been the reality that the USA could intercept any electronic communication anywhere in the world but the advent of the Internet and digital communications has created a whole new treasure trove of information which can be plundered by the security services. The reason that so many terrorist attacks in the UK and elsewhere have been thwarted is precisely because the security services have accessed the terrorist communications. Now that is on the plus side, but on the minus side the state now has the technical means to know almost everything about individual citizens. Now the challenge for democratic nation states is to ensure that access to personal information is only used according to strict legally established and internationally observed rules which protect the individual from the state. What we do not need is the EU using this issue to further assert its pretentions to be a political state. Equally it does not help that the British Government is now nothing more than a lapdog of the USA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I think that it was the IRA who said to the security services ‘you have to win every time, we only have to win once’. The security services have a tremendously difficult job in thwarting these attacks, and in the UK we know that there have been many – some we know about and some we do not – which have been stopped because of the security services’ ability to look at people’s communications. I think there are two issues here. There is the issue of what they can do by looking at people’s communications, and then there is this totally indiscriminate collecting of information on everybody, which I think is extremely dangerous. Can you imagine if Hitler, Stalin or Mao had had access to this information? I do not think that I am disagreeing with you; we probably agree more than we disagree on this. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, there is no rule of law in Russia. The Russian Government is a gangster regime which is successfully exporting the rule of lawlessness to the West. Meanwhile Western Governments follow a policy of appeasement. In 2006 agents of the Russian State murdered my constituent Alexander Litvinenko in an act of state-sponsored terrorism. David Cameron has broken his earlier promises to help uncover what happened; instead, he has made a deal with President Putin. The British Government is to withhold vital evidence from the coroner’s court proving the involvement of the Russian State. Russia blatantly murders people on the streets of London and the British Government agrees to look the other way.  Law enforcement in Russia is just a tool of organised crime. Any cooperation with Russia in security and legal matters should be out of the question until the rule of law is properly established there. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, last year we saw the Schengen system buckle under the strain of mass migration, and some Member States sought to introduce unilateral controls. The revision of the rules is an attempt to keep the lid on a boiling pot, but it is too little and too late. It only allows some controls in very exceptional circumstances for a limited period of time. It is too little, too late.  An open-borders policy could only work between countries with very similar and stable economic and cultural natures. The EU’s open-borders policy is a disaster for ordinary people, and has created enormous social problems. This has all been done in pursuit of a political ideology not shared by the people of Europe. That ideology is that the continent of Europe is a single country, a United States of Europe, which obviously it is not. The EU is out of touch with reality and in a contest between reality and ideology, reality always wins in the end.

Mr Goebbels, you asked about border controls. Yes, Britain is not in the Schengen system, but we still suffer from the effects of it because it is very much easier for people to get to Calais and make that final hop over to Britain. You are quite right: even though we are supposed to have border controls, immigration policy is a disaster in my country. This is not just because of the European Union, it is because of the complete inability and lack of will on the part of British governments to actually put in proper immigration controls and carry them out. So I agree with you that this is a disaster in my country that is not entirely of the making of the EU. In answer to Ms Morvai’s question regarding the free movement of people: no, we do not believe in the free movement of peoples in my party. We believe in controlled immigration and controlled border policy. We do not want to stop immigrants; we do not want to stop people coming. But we want this to be controlled by our government in the interests of the British people, and not in the interests of a political ideology which they do not share. If you are going to control people, it is a lot easier to do that than capital, which is often numbers on a computer, so I understand the problems there. We want to see policies in a whole range of areas that are in the interests of the British people, and then ultimately in the interests of everybody else. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the economies of Europe are in deep crisis, and unemployment is reaching record levels. But there is one boom industry offering unprecedented employment opportunities. That of course is organised crime. This report recognises the seriousness of the situation and offers the solution we have come to expect on every occasion, namely a common European approach and more harmonised laws. But it is precisely the common European approach that has helped create the problem in the first place. Every annual Europol organised crime threat assessment report since 2009 has said that the root cause for the growth of organised crime across Europe is the EU’s own open-borders policy. This report suggests the creation of an ‘intelligence training centre’. However, the intelligent thing to do would not be to set up another institution expanding the power of the EU, but to reintroduce border controls to prevent the free movement of criminals in the first place.

Mr President, I would like to apologise in advance for digressing from the subject of this debate and using my time to make reference to a shocking incident that has happened in my constituency, London, today. There has been a particularly cowardly and disgusting terrorist murder of a man in Woolwich. Initial reports indicate that the victim appears to be a member of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. I am sure that all of you, like me, will offer your deepest sympathy to the victim’s family, friends and colleagues. It is not possible to express the depth of outrage that all decent people will feel at this latest expression of barbaric and mindless terrorism. This crime will be condemned by all decent people.

Mr President, as this question makes clear, the report calls for the Commission to publish its proposals on a voluntary permanent Union relocation scheme, as promised since December 2011. It is the intention of this scheme that Member States can request assistance in the relocation of refugees and asylum seekers across EU borders. The UK, of course, has a long history of accepting refugees and asylum seekers in very significant numbers over centuries. If the proposed scheme is voluntary then what is the point? Member States could continue to determine their own responses to particular circumstances in relation to their own ability to respond, which is exactly what they should do. Asylum and immigration policy should remain under national control. It is easy to understand why the Commission does not want to come up with a scheme that will be unworkable in any case.

 Madam President, the next meeting of the Bilderberg Group is to be held in England. The location is thought to be the Grove Hotel, Watford, and the dates to be 6 to 9 June 2013.

The biggest mystery surrounding them is why the mainstream newspapers and broadcasters have chosen not to report on them since 1954. In the internet age, however, their existence can no longer be kept secret. I have written to all the mainstream media outlets in the UK asking them if they intend to report on this meeting and if not, why not.

 Madam President, this is just a public relations exercise to paint a veneer of democracy over the undemocratic European Union. The best definition of democracy that I know of was given by Abraham Lincoln, who said that it was ‘government of the people, by the people and for the people’. There are no common people in Europe; there is no political identity with which they can identify, so you can never have a true democratic system in the European Union as a whole. The only democracy that makes any sense is the democracy of nation states, where people identify with a common political identity. All democratic governments in different countries take different forms. They all have different structures. But in order for a country to be called a democracy, it must have one single characteristic: the ability not only to elect the government but also to sack the government and replace it with a different government. Of course, that is the one thing you cannot do in the European Union. The people do not select the Commission, who are the effective government of the European Union, and they cannot sack them. Therefore no country that is a member of the European Union can claim to be a functioning democracy. We are seeing our democracies destroyed. All the governments of the western world, and in particular those of the European Union, are disconnecting from their own people and imposing policies on them which they do not want – like mass uncontrolled immigration and idiotic climate change legislation, which is destroying their economies. The only Citizens’ Initiative which makes any sense is the initiative to leave the European Union. People in Britain have the opportunity to do that by voting for the UK Independence Party, and they are doing it in increasing numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, why does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place? I expect she hopes to benefit from EU handouts and subsidies like so many before her. As a relatively poor country, I also expect that she hopes to offload some of her poorest citizens – her surplus population – by means of mass immigration under the EU’s open borders policy. Turkey has over 72 million people, and if she joins the EU we can expect a large number of them to migrate to countries like Britain. Perhaps they will come to work, or to go on the benefits or housing system again like so many before them and use our public services. The British public must beware that the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democratic parties are all in favour of Turkish entry and of yet more waves of mass immigration.

Mr President, over the last decade the international community has spent an enormous amount of money in assistance to Kosovo. At a rough estimate this is about EUR 4.7 billion. This includes about EUR 2.3 billion from the European Union and Member States. One of the key targets for this aid has been to combat organised crime and establish the rule of law. Now, how is that progressing? The EU office of criminal intelligence has said that ‘the situation regarding organised crime in Kosovo has not changed considerably since 1999’. A Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly report in December 2010 linked senior Kosovan politicians to criminal gangs involved in human organ trafficking. We already have plenty of criminals from Kosovo in London, despite the fact that it is not yet a member of the EU. EU entry would enable yet more to come. We already have enough, thank you very much.

Mr President, mutual societies and building societies were an excellent idea that originated in 18th century Birmingham, and the idea caught on and enabled millions of people to buy their own homes when otherwise they would have been unable to do so. But they were not intended to be cross-border international entrepreneurial businesses. A much better idea is for individual nation states to adopt the idea and adapt it to fit in with their own national requirements. This statute, if adopted, will mean more unwanted EU legislation and probably lead to unforeseen, unwanted consequences and unintended consequences. If there is any case for international cross-border operation, then there is no reason why this could not be accomplished by sovereign nation states with intergovernmental agreements.

Mr President, if I am in good shape it is not because I play football. I would happily admit that I know absolutely nothing about sport, but I do know a little bit about match-fixing.  First of all, let me say that this report calls for a specialised law enforcement unit to combat match-fixing. Well, I am pleased to tell you we have already got one in the United Kingdom, it is called the police force.  Having said that, in terms of match-fixing, the EU has been involved in a few fixed matches itself. Back in 1975, in the referendum in the UK on membership of the EU, that was a fixed match, when the Central Intelligence Agency of the USA put enormous amounts of money into the ‘Yes’ campaign and there was a concerted effort by the BBC and other organs of the media to actually fix the result. There was a fixed match in 1992 in Denmark when the referendum delivered the wrong result and they were told to go back and have a re-match until they came up with the right result. There was a fixed match in France and Holland on the Constitution when they came up with the wrong result, but rather than have the re-match, actually they changed the terms of the game and declared it a win anyway. And, of course, Ireland had a match fixed when it delivered the wrong result on the Lisbon Treaty, and then had to go back and have a re-match until it got the right result. So if there is going to be some kind of investigative body to look at fixed matches, I suggest we start with the European Union.

 Yes, I happily admit I know nothing about sport. I pretend to have no knowledge of it whatsoever.  In terms of international crime, there is already an international crime organisation called Interpol, which is there to share information, and there are national police forces that are there to pursue crime in their individual nation states. So I cannot see why you need yet another new body to do something that is already catered for by existing police forces and Interpol. I do not know why you imagine that some other body, created by the European Union, is going to be any more efficient than all the other bodies created by the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, it is poetic justice that my party, the UK Independence Party, wins seats in this place and wins them in increasing numbers. Indeed, we came second out of the UK political parties in 2009. We did so precisely because we are dedicated to taking Britain out of the European Union.  Regarding the composition of Parliament in 2014, I would like to make one prediction: the UK political party most likely to come first and return the highest number of MEPs will be the UK Independence Party. This will reflect the growing mood of the British population and will be another important milestone on the road to achieving Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, what does social security coordination mean? Does it mean that the benefits systems of all EU states are brought up to the British standard at their taxpayers’ expense? No, it means that the British benefits system is made available to any EU citizen who wants to use it. My constituency – London – particularly feels the impact of foreign claimants on the housing, health and benefits systems. David Cameron has had to respond to public outrage by saying that he wants to limit EU citizens’ access to benefits, but he cannot do so, and he knows it. It is not often that I can agree with an EU Commissioner, but Viviane Reding has said that this is against EU law and that he cannot discriminate on the basis of nationality. England is now the soup kitchen of the world, and the soup is running out. This is just one of the reasons why we have to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Many of my constituents have contacted me in desperation because their disability payments are being cut or stopped altogether. One lady rang to tell me of her young adult daughter who has a learning disability and whose disability benefit payment was being stopped because she has been assessed as fit for work. She took her daughter to the Job Centre to look for something she might be able to do. She found that all the low-skilled, low-paid jobs were taken, often by migrants without the disadvantage of a disability. In the same queue were EU citizens signing on for the Jobseeker’s Allowance. She asked me to explain why we, as a country, cannot afford her daughter’s benefit but we can afford to pay benefits to migrants from the EU. I told her that this was because our Government’s spending decisions and priorities are not decided in the interests of their own citizens but rather in order to comply with EU law and their ambitions to build a borderless United States of Europe. I further explained that the only solution to the problem is for Britain to leave the European Union. Following our conversation that lady, like some many more people, will be voting for the UK Independence Party at their next opportunity. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr Van Orden, if in your report five years ago you highlighted all these problems – which were very serious problems then and which you now say are still very serious problems and in fact even worse probably than when you wrote your report – why did you then feel it necessary to recommend Bulgarian entry to the EU when it clearly did not fulfil the criteria that one would expect, the most basic criteria about rule of law and democracy in an entrant country?

Mr President, in January 2014 the final restrictions will be lifted on immigration into Britain from Romania and Bulgaria. A further 29 million people will be given the automatic right of entry, and it is estimated that this will result in at least 50 000 extra immigrants per year over the next five years. Britain is already overwhelmed and swamped with immigration because, as a member of the European Union, we have surrendered our right to control it. The British have nothing against Bulgarians or anyone else: we do not blame them for wanting to better their lives. But why do so many Bulgarians want to leave their country? Bulgaria is a desperately poor country under the control of criminals. Let me quote from the New York Times: ‘Politics is played to the death in Bulgaria, where the lives of politicians can be as cheap as spent bullets and murky business groups wage a murderous struggle for their cut of everything from real estate deals to millions in European aid’. Atanas Atanasov, a former counter-intelligence chief, has said, ‘Other countries have the mafia; in Bulgaria the mafia have the country’. How can democracy prosper under these conditions? There is a lack of a free media and press, a corrupt judiciary and legal system, widespread electoral fraud and criminal control of business. It is no surprise that many Bulgarians will choose to move somewhere else. One good thing that the EU did do was to suspend payments to Bulgaria. It is not right to send millions in aid for their criminals to plunder and make them richer. I feel desperately sorry for decent Bulgarians, but I feel even sorrier for my own country, which is being destroyed by membership of the European Union. The British political establishment is dedicated – or seems dedicated – to turning Britain into a third-world country. Britain cannot solve Bulgaria’s problems by importing Bulgarians.

Yes Mrs Dodds, I would agree with you. I think that we should designate groups like that as terrorism because the last thing that we want to see is what happened in Northern Ireland. Terrorism and politics often go hand in hand and I would hate to see it happen in my country, as it did in Northern Ireland, that the terrorists actually propel people into government, where they are now. Of course, I would like to see action taken against Islamic fundamentalism wherever it raises its head because it goes hand in hand with terrorism. In London we now have Sharia patrols intimidating people on the street on what they can or cannot do or can or cannot wear, and gays have been intimidated in the Bethnal Green area. I think it is very important, I take your point and I totally agree with you. Gerard Batten  (EFD

It is part of the United Kingdom, and I accept that: that was a slip of the tongue.

Mr President, this report proposes a regulation to reduce noise from motor vehicles and, like all legislation from this place, it will entail more bureaucracy and cost. For example, the report says that the quality of road surfaces may be the solution to the problem. Perhaps, but how much would it cost to alter them? Given the current state of Member States’ finances, one wonders where they would find the money to carry out this momentous task.  This is a regulation. It will have automatic, binding, legal effect in every Member State. Democratically elected national governments do not have the right to decide whether they want to apply it or not: they have no choice. Perhaps control of noise pollution is one of those powers that David Cameron wants to renegotiate the return of to the British Parliament, among those many thousands of others long ago surrendered to the European Union. Meanwhile, he must continue to obey his masters in Brussels. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Mr Imran Firasat is a Pakistani who converted from Islam to Christianity. Spain granted him asylum in 2004 because as an apostate his life was at risk. The Spanish authorities are now threatening to deport him to Pakistan under hate speech laws mandated by the European Commission.  Mr Firasat produced a film entitled ‘The Innocent Prophet’, as part of his critique of Islam. An altered version of the film was released last December without Mr Firasat’s consent. This appears to be the extent of his transgression. If Mr Firasat is deported he may face the death penalty for alleged blasphemy.  Individuals and organisations across Europe and the world are calling on the Spanish authorities not to take any action until Mr Firasat’s lawyers have lodged his appeal with the Spanish High Court. It would be a betrayal of all western liberal and democratic values if Mr Firasat was sent to his death for criticising a belief system. Gerard Batten,

Mr President, this is yet another unwarranted and unnecessary transfer of sovereignty from the nation state to the European Union. There is a highly respected patent court in the UK which is currently worth something like GBP 750 million per annum and this is now in danger. Patent specialists in the UK strongly contend that there is no demand in the UK for this change. There are serious concerns about judicial appointments to the new court and therefore about the quality of the decisions that will be made. Instead of a meritocratic appointment system, it seems that subscribing Member States will be entitled to a judge. Many of the smaller countries have tiny patent jurisdictions, few patent judges and few legal practitioners in this field from whom to choose judges. As with so much legislation from this place, this is being done in favour of very large companies at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. SMEs and individuals will be seriously disadvantaged in protecting their innovations, by reason of cost and inconvenience, bearing in mind that they will have to go to France and Germany to protect their work rather than to local courts.  We are told that there will be cost savings, but that is not the opinion of experts. One estimate is that litigation costs will increase by a factor of three. UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this measure. ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr Karim, of course, unlike you I am not a great devotee of the European Union, but I have got my information from Dr Jochen Pagenberg, who is an expert in the field, admitted to the Munich and Paris Bars; the author was a member of the EU’s Committee of Experts and withdrew from this body by the end of 2011.

Mr President, England had fundamental rights under the common law for centuries before the concept was dreamed of by the European Union, and we do not need the European Convention on Human Rights to bestow them on us. Those ancient rights and liberties are now being destroyed by the creation of an EU system of criminal law, for example under the infamous European Arrest Warrant. What have your fundamental rights given us in return? Suspects against whom no evidence has been presented to a British court can be extradited and imprisoned for months or years without trial. Meanwhile, we have been prevented from extraditing non-British suspect terrorists and criminals to their own countries outside the European Union because of legal judgments made under the Convention. Those of you who lived under Communist dictatorships prior to your joining the European Union might think that this is an improvement. The English do not. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, of course SIS is an international police database system but also associated with this is an EU police organisation called SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at National Entry). Now this is a little known organisation and it has been described by some of its operatives as top secret. It has executive powers and although Britain is not yet a member of the Schengen Group, the UK is expected to joint SIRENE in 2013. It already has officers working within Member States’ police forces and our German SIRENE officer is attached to the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency and his name is Jan-Per Ruehmann. Under Schengen an alert placed on an SIS database should be treated as a European Arrest Warrant. Therefore within the Schengen area, at least, extradition may now simply be on the basis of the hit on a database. European Arrest Warrants will rise sharply after we join SIS in 2013. If I may conclude: the noble Baroness Ludford referred to a europhobe, possibly myself. I do not hate Europe. I love Europe; I dislike the European Union and what I love most are the ancient liberties of my countrymen which I want to preserve. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 – Mr President, this report seeks to generate a regulation to restrict members of the public from purchasing, and to require notification concerning sales of, a large number of substances which are commonly used for legitimate purposes. Unfortunately, the UK has extensive experience of the use of home-made explosive devices – for example, terrorists have used fertiliser as a basis for bombs for many years. The UK does not need the EU to tell it how to manage the availability of such substances. This is a regulation which seeks to extend the power and dominion of the EU using the prevention of terrorism as a pretext. I and my UKIP colleagues will therefore vote against. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 – Mr President, I would like to comment on an article in today’s Daily Express
 by Leo McKinstry. He writes that the Tory Party should offer some kind of electoral deal to the UK Independence Party. Now UKIP should never accept any such deal for the following reasons: The Tories can never be trusted. They have betrayed Britain for over 40 years and they would betray anyone. If the Tories wanted to offer the British people a referendum on continued membership of the European Union, they could easily do so. They do not need to make any deal with UKIP. If UKIP entered any such pact, it would destroy our credibility with the electorate. UKIP would end up in the same position as the Liberal Democrats, facing electoral annihilation, and the cause of Britain’s exit from the European Union would be lost forever. UKIP must never compromise its campaign to restore Britain’s status as a sovereign, independent, self-governing democracy. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– The horrors of forced abortions in China is just the latest in decades of abuse and torture of Chinese citizens by their communist Party government. We should not forget that since July 20 1999, former Chinese communist party President, Jiang Zemin, ordered the start of the systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which is still going on. The Amnesty International Annual Report 2012 on China, published on 24th May 2012, states that the Chinese authorities continued to pursue a systematic, nationwide, often violent campaign against Falun Gong; The US State department reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 published on 24th May 2012, where it states that overseas and domestic media and advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting, particularly from Falun Gong practitioners. All of us who care about democratic government should speak out about the last 13 years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China and democratic governments and societies everywhere should send a strong message to the Chinese Government to immediately stop persecuting Falun Gong practitioners in China.

Mr President, since we are discussing justice I would like to raise a disturbing issue that has come to my attention today. Mr Roger Hayes has been summarily sentenced to 21 days in Liverpool prison following a cursory appearance before a magistrate on Monday. Mr Hayes was arrested at 8.30 a.m., taken to court, sentenced and locked up by 6 p.m. that evening. No members of the public or witnesses were reportedly allowed at his hearing. Mr Hayes’ family have reportedly been refused any direct access to him. Mr Hayes is the founder of the British Constitution Group and is a prominent tax protestor. His case arises from his withholding of Council tax on a legally-based objection that the revenue is being illegally used. Mr Hayes’ imprisonment may well be illegal under English common law. Mr Hayes must be freed without delay and the issues behind it widely publicised. I hope this helps. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I have had literally hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails from around the world on this subject, at least 99.9% of them asked me to vote against it. I can assure these people, and especially my constituents in London, that I and my UKIP colleagues will vote against ACTA. But one element of ACTA which particularly concerns me is the criminalisation of offences under Article 23. Of course, genuine copyright and intellectual property right infringements must be prevented and owners’ rights protected, but the European Union is creating its own comprehensive police state with provisions such as the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order. Criminalisation opens up all kinds of sinister possibilities for suppressing free speech, dissent and alternative points of view. We only have to look at the case of Julian Assange to see where that can lead. All things considered, I urge my colleagues here to vote against ACTA. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, David Cameron has suggested that there might be a referendum on the European Union, but he does not know when and he does not know what the question should be. He only knows what the question will not be: should Britain leave the European Union? This is because he does not know what the EU will look like in the future. But we all know, do we not? Those of us here on both sides of the EU argument know exactly that it is intended to be a single European political state, a United States of Europe. The current eurozone crisis is being used to bring about financial and economic government and full political integration. The only person who apparently does not understand this is David Cameron. The UK Independence Party can explain it to him, exactly as we are explaining it to his voters. The only referendum that the British people want is a straight question on whether we should stay in or get out and we want it sooner rather than later. Gerard Batten,

– Mr President, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania are threatening the EU-Canada trade agreement unless Canada lifts its visa requirement for visitors from those three countries. Canadians do not need visas to visit EU countries, whereas Canada has imposed visa restrictions on these three EU Member States. This is because of a previous influx of people from those countries who outstayed their welcome. Canada takes the quite reasonable view that not all EU countries are the same, and that some pose a particular risk when it comes to unwanted visitors and guests. The Canadians want to pick and choose who they admit and who they do not. However, this realistic view of the world falls foul of the EU ideological view that the EU is, in fact, one country, and to discriminate against one of its regions is not permissible. The Canadian Government already has a very generous system of allowing visa-free entry for 24 EU Member States, but perhaps it has looked at my constituency, London, and seen what a completely unrestricted open-door immigration policy actually delivers. They will not get the visitors and migrants they want – the decent, hard-working and law-abiding – they will also get the down-and-outs, the deadbeats and the criminals. In Marble Arch, the very centre of London, we now have migrants living on the street, with all the unpleasant social and sanitary consequences that involves, which I will leave to your imagination. This is what indiscriminate, visa-free travel can deliver. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement put in jeopardy by Canada’s reluctance to open its doors to allcomers is reputedly worth a potential USD 12 billion per annum, and would boost two-way trade by 20%. What does the world need now? Does it desperately need increased trade? Does it desperately need increased economic activity, jobs and increased prosperity? I think we would all agree that it does. Does it desperately need even more uncontrolled and unlimited migration? Most rational people would think that it does not. Let the Canadians choose who they want to let into their country, and on what terms. Let Canada and Europe get on with increasing the trade between them that can help us all out of the dire economic situation that we find ourselves in. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this report confirms what I have been warning my constituents in London about, and the British people generally, for some years, which is that the EU intends to create its own system of criminal law. This project is already very well advanced and very comprehensive and I have written about it in a report of my own, Freedom, Security &amp; Justice? or The Creation of a European Union Police State
. We do not need an EU system of criminal law in England. We have something called the common law which has taken a thousand years to evolve. We have safeguards under the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and habeas corpus, which are being swept away under this new system. They are being set aside. A British citizen can now be sent off to any corner of the European Union on the strength of a piece of paper with vague accusations. They can be imprisoned for months or years. The English and Scottish courts have abdicated their duty to protect their own citizens from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. Your system of EU criminal law would do for our liberties what the European single currency has done for your economies. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, we see increasing moves by governments to limit our personal freedom and privacy, citing the need to protect us from the threat of terrorism and organised crime. However, we have to be extremely cautious in allowing our freedoms to be removed, because once they are gone it is very hard to restore them. We also have to ask if we have any particular reason to trust our governments. Legislation intruding into the citizen’s right to privacy should be proportionate, limited and controlled. Once it is enacted we need to be sure that its scope cannot be widened at the whim of government. This kind of legislation should never have been proposed by the Commission in the first place. It probably comes under the jurisdiction of international law. It should be devised under international agreements by sovereign nation states. The legislation is also unacceptable because it is one-way traffic between Europe and the USA. We have to give them our citizens’ personal information, but they do not have to supply theirs. The motion for a resolution wants the final decision to be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union to rule on its legality and compatibility with the EU Treaties. The UK Independence Party’s MEPs will vote against this legislation. We will not vote in favour of the motion as we do not accept the legitimacy of the European Court. Gerard Batten,

Madam President, last year I wrote to David Cameron urging him to oppose the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The coalition government replied that they were obligated to accede to it and that in any case it would not change the existing situation regarding the UK. EU accession to the ECHR is required under Article 6(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Cameron could have given the decision to the British people by honouring his promise, indeed his cast-iron guarantee, of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. He reneged on that promise after the Labour Government had ratified the Treaty. But treaties are ratified by acts of parliament, and any act can be repealed. If he had wanted to, he could have repealed the ratification act and then submitted Lisbon to a referendum of the people. Instead he betrayed his promise and his guarantee turned out to be worthless. Now the government tells us not to worry anyway, because it makes no difference. But this is not true either. Britain could not opt out of or reform the Convention even if it wanted to, because we are bound by the Treaty of Lisbon. As usual the Tories betrayed Britain. Now they are in denial about the consequences of that betrayal. They had a solution and they did not use it. Now the only solution is the one advocated by the UK Independence Party, which is for Britain to leave the European Union.

Madam President, I have never advocated that Britain should leave the United Nations, which is a properly-constituted international body. It has always been my view, and it has been the policy of my party, that Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights and that we should repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. So I think I and my party have been entirely consistent in that. Gerard Batten  (EFD

blue-card question. –
 We come from completely opposite views on this and I do not think we are ever going to agree, but I have come across a curious anomaly which I would like your view on. The European Convention on Human Rights has been used by people like Abu Hamza and terrorist suspects to prevent their extradition to countries like America on the basis that their human rights might be abused. But I have sat in courts dealing with European Arrest Warrant cases, and one in particular where the European Convention was invoked because it was almost certain that, in being extradited to Greece, suspects would be held in the Korydallos Prison, where it was 100% guaranteed that their human rights were going to be violated. But the government prosecutor put the point that since Greece was a signatory of the Convention on Human Rights it could not be deemed to be in breach of it. The appeal court agreed and the suspects were extradited. Is it not odd that foreign countries are covered by the European Convention on Human Rights but it does not seem to apply in European countries and does not offer the protection that we would give to people being extradited to the USA? Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, the harmonisation of EU social security systems does not, of course, mean the harmonisation of the benefit systems themselves – that would be unachievable – but rather the harmonisation of access to those systems by all EU citizens. What this means is that many social security claimants will gravitate to those states with the most generous systems. In Britain, nearly five million people are on the council house waiting list, with little prospect of getting a home, but in some London boroughs, almost 50% of social housing is given to people not born in the UK. Many of these people will never have paid a penny in tax and will be living on state benefits. Of course there is no point in homeless Londoners emigrating to other EU Member States to seek homes and income on their social security systems because the benefits will not be as reciprocal. No one should gain public housing or benefits in Britain until they have paid tax for a considerable period of time. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, jobs which could easily be saved are being lost in London because of EU legislation. The Tate and Lyle sugar refinery in the borough of Newham has been forced to cut back on production and lay off 30 staff. This is because, under EU quota rules, they cannot buy the raw sugar they need within the EU. However, the Commission has the power to change the rules and allow Tate and Lyle to buy what they need on the world market. I wrote to Commissioner Cioloş on 14 March, asking him to urgently meet with Tate and Lyle so they could put their case for resolving the problem. So far, I have not had a reply. We cannot afford to lose these jobs in one of the poorest parts of London. I urge Commissioner Cioloş to meet with Tate and Lyle as soon as possible in order to reach a solution. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, I know that Mr Helmer is something of an expert on this subject, and wonder whether he can confirm or deny something that I have read in the press, which is that if Britain closed down all of its industry, took every British aeroplane out of the sky and every British car off the road, this would not actually make any discernible difference to the world output of CO2
 emission gases. In fact, if we completely closed everything down, it would have no effect at all. Can he state whether that is true or not? Gerard Batten, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, this regulation is the thin end of yet another wedge. The danger is that it will lead to an EU law of property ownership. An EU certificate of succession is a short step away from a European probate registry and the introduction of an EU property tax. Now, I doubt that many people in England realise that we are debating the EU’s intention to take control of inheritance law. The one good thing I can say about this is that the British Government has exercised its opt-out. It has not done that out of any principle – it does not have any any principles where the EU is concerned and there is only so much that you can get past the British public at any one time. What amazes me is not that they have opted out but that there was ever any serious intention of opting in. I was going to address myself to the MEPs here but as there are so few of them it is quite a redundant statement this evening. Anyway, some MEPs might like to consider the wisdom of handing yet more control to the EU in this area and vote with MEPs from the UK Independence Party against it. Gerard Batten  (EFD

I am reliably informed that this is the first time this appears to have happened in the experience of our assistants in five years of preparing voting lists. Not all Members may be aware of its existence, and I wish to draw your attention to it. If you vote for this, then the whole of the rest of the motion falls. It is in support of the Hungarians being free to determine their own constitution without pressure from the EU.

Madam President, I have had hundreds of e-mails from my constituents on the subject of ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. ACTA intends to take alleged infringements of copyright, patents and trademarking from the jurisdiction of civil law to criminal law. Intellectual property rights have to be protected but ACTA, like so much legislation that comes from this place, favours the interest of big business over small business and individuals. If this comes under criminal law, the great danger is that alleged transgressors could be extradited on European arrest warrants to the four corners of the European Union to face months or years in prison. I and my colleagues in the UK Independence Party are once again the voice of the people in this place. UK Independence Party MEPs oppose ACTA and we will vote against it when the time comes. We urge all MEPs to do the same. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, the BBC is currently broadcasting a series entitled ‘Putin, Russia and the West’. In the second programme, Tony Blair’s former aide Jonathan Powell recounts the famous ‘spy rock’ scandal story. The Kremlin had accused MI6 of funding Russian human rights groups and other NGOs and using a fake rock located in a Moscow square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents. Mr Powell confirmed this story (whether it is true or not), and the BBC elevated it to the status of a scoop by issuing a press release. The FSB reacted promptly, publicly accusing two leading NGOs – Memorial and Golos – of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by the West. Both organisations are now under systematic harassment by the authorities. Powell’s claim is either untrue or illegal under the Official Secrets Act. The BBC is guilty of gross journalistic irresponsibility, and this shows once again that Putin’s is a gangster regime. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I agree with Mr Nuttall but I do not think he goes far enough. Surely this is a disgrace and surely it raises a quandary for sports fans because, for example, in the World Cup, if the national flag and the EU flag are being displayed, then who are sports fans supporting – their country or the EU? Would Mr Nuttall not agree with me that they cannot support the EU because it is not a country? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, this directive calls for common rights for third-party migrants working in the EU. If adopted it would remove what little rights remain or are still left to Member States to determine their own immigration policy. It wants third-party migrants to enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals, including working conditions, social security and access to public services. But of course not all Member States have the same level of social security and public services, and of course a citizen of a state, by definition, enjoys the benefits of that citizenship, or should enjoy the benefits of that citizenship that non-citizens do not. If citizens do not have exclusive rights, then the concept of citizenship itself is meaningless. What this will mean is that third-party migrants will flood to those states that have the highest levels of public housing, social security and public services. No prizes for guessing that Britain will be top of their list as a destination. Equally unsurprisingly, I can tell you that UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this directive.

 I know that may be technically true, but we seem to get saddled with these directives in time anyway. I am sure that we will not be able to wriggle out of it for very long, in the same way as we get all kinds of people turning up in our country and taking benefits in the social security and housing system, although they have got no rights to them. We know that for a fact. So while I hope that you are right and there will be a way of avoiding this, I think that in practice we will not. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, this directive includes the right to information for persons facing a European arrest warrant. In the case of an EAW, it will have to be a short letter. Subjects of EAWs effectively have no meaningful rights. Provided that the form has been correctly completed, the court has no power to refuse extradition. The court cannot base its decision on the prima facie evidence – or the lack of it – against the accused person. What is worse is that some people are being extradited, not after being charged, but to face investigation. One of my constituents in London, Dr Miguel-Ángel Meizoso, is facing extradition to Spain, not for something that he is alleged to have done, but for something he is accused of that he might possibly do in the future. If you do not believe me, I can give you the case papers. An English court would reject his extradition if it had any power to do so. Giving Dr Meizoso a nice letter will not protect him and will be small consolation. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I would like to address Mr Barroso. You always tell the same story which is more of the same: more Europe, not less Europe. Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity was to keep on doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. You propose yet more swathes of legislation and yet more power to the EU. You have previously said that the EU must assume economic and financial fiscal governance of the Member States. Where has all this centralisation of power actually got you? The EU underperforms economically with the rest of the world, mainly because of the burden of job-destroying and prosperity-restricting legislation. The crises in Greece and Italy have been, in part, caused by their membership of the European single currency. Instead of organising an orderly exit, they have had to sacrifice democratic government and have it replaced by rule by economists and technocrats. You propose yet more of the same thing and expect different results. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to predict the result. Gerard Batten,

– Madam President, the European Union is becoming increasingly unpopular with citizens across the continent. It is rightly seen as out of touch, undemocratic and dictatorial. The euro, its grand unifying political project, is collapsing round its ears. Greece and Italy are the first to pay the price by having undemocratic government imposed on them. So what does the Commission do to halt this decline in popularity? It comes up with vain and crass projects in an effort to make itself appear more relevant to Member States. First, it attempted to place the EU flag – which is not meant to exist anyway – on the sports kits of national teams. Then it calls for the EU flag to be flown at sporting events, and now it comes up with the crackpot idea of EU heritage labels. In the report, it says that these EU heritage sites would be monuments, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and even places of remembrance. What an insult! Are you really suggesting that war memorials which honour the brave and fallen in two World Wars should have an EU plaque placed on them? There is only one memorial in England I can think of where it would be appropriate to stick an EU plaque, and that is the gravestone of Ted Heath, the man who betrayed Britain into the European Union. I do not think anyone would object to that, least of all him. The report also says that the plaque’s aim is to strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU. It will not: it will just enrage the natives. It is just desperate propaganda from an organisation to which more and more people do not wish to belong. I urge all MEPs who are proud of the heritage of their own nations to vote for my group’s rejection amendment tomorrow. Let us stick the European Heritage Label on the dustbin of history. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this own-initiative report on the Professional Qualifications Directive is another piece of ideologically-driven harmonisation. It calls for minimum training requirements, automatic recognition and the removing of formal obstacles to recognition of professional qualifications. It goes on to say that ‘only if necessary should language tests be part of the recognition process and cannot be an additional border to mobility’. Most normal people would want professional qualifications, especially medical qualifications, to be subject to maximum, not minimum, standards – and not speaking the language properly should very much be a bar to practising and mobility. There is a case that clearly demonstrates the dangers. In 2008, a German-qualified doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani, was convicted in England of gross negligence and manslaughter after he over prescribed drugs to a patient. This directive means we cannot discriminate against EU professionals, while we must discriminate against properly-qualified fluent English speakers from the Commonwealth. This is another good reason, if we needed one, why Britain should leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in recent months, England has seen a series of despicable crimes: memorial plaques recording the names of the heroic dead of two world wars are being systematically stolen for their scrap metal value. Decent English people wonder how these revered monuments which have stood safely in cities, towns and villages for generations have become the targets for thieves. Today’s Daily Express
 reports that the police believe that these crimes are predominantly carried out by Romanian gangs. The EU’s open door policy is directly to blame; we do not just get the decent, honest, hard-working migrants that we might choose. We are forced to take the lowest forms of criminal life merely because they are EU citizens. Membership of the EU is destroying my country. What more revolting proof of that could there be than the melting down for scrap of the monuments to those who gave their lives so we could be free. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, demographics, of course, is a fascinating subject, and behind great historical developments and changes there is often an untold demographic story. Britain is now undergoing a massive population explosion which, until very recently, went unreported. When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997, we had a population of just over 58 million. That population has now grown to over 62.4 million and, on current trends, the population will grow to over 70 million by 2030 and thereafter spiral ever upwards. Demographers calculate that all this unsustainable population growth is down to migration and births to migrants. There is nothing wrong with some appropriate, moderate and sustainable immigration, but the UK is adding over one million people to its net population every four to five years. England is more densely populated than India, China and Japan. Britain does not have a cohesion policy, but if it did, it would leave the European Union and regain control of its borders and its immigration policy. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, and thank you, Mr Bisky, you mention in your speech that anti-Europe sentiment and feeling was gaining ground. Can I ask you to accept that there is a clear distinction between anti-European Union feeling and anti-Europe? The people who are anti the European Union of the political construction, like me, are very pro-Europe. Would you please accept that there is a clear distinction there and we should stop talking about anti-European sentiment and start talking about anti-European Union sentiment? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, the so-called ‘six pack’ imposes economic rule on the Member States via the European Union. The English Parliament established in the reign of King Edward I that its key reason for existing was control of the public finances. In 1642 the English fought a Civil War and then cut off a King’s head precisely in order to establish its sole right to levy taxes. Now, not by means of an Act of Parliament, but by means of a regulation from the European Union, the British Government is expected to meekly accept financial control by the European Union. If it does, there can no longer be any pretence that Britain is a sovereign nation or a democracy. The British Government should reject and repudiate these regulations and defend the rights of Parliament. To do otherwise is abject surrender. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 The architects of the European Single Currency are to blame for the crisis that now faces the eurozone. The euro was never an economic project. It was a political project designed to help bring about a United States of Europe. Once of the vital attributes of a state is its currency and that is why the European Union forced through the introduction of the euro against all the sensible advice against it. You do not have to be an economist to know that to constrain a number of completely different economies within a single interest rate and exchange rate will, over time, bring nothing but problems and eventual disaster. That is what we are seeing now, and of course Mr Barroso is calling for full economic and financial governance of the eurozone countries by the European Union. The crisis was entirely predictable and so was Mr Barroso’s proposed solution. The euro is going to come apart. It is just a question of time. The longer it takes the worse the crash is going to be. The people to blame are those who forced the economies of the eurozone into an economic straightjacket in order to serve a political dogma. Gerard Batten,

– Madam President, there is indeed a massive problem with illegal immigration into Europe. The effects of this problem are especially felt in England and, in particular, in my constituency of London. England attracts immigration – illegal and legal – because of the possibilities for work and our generous benefits and housing systems. The UK Independence Party would not be opposed to genuine cooperation between European nation states to counter the problems of illegal immigration – but this proposal is not about genuine cooperation. It seeks to change the legal basis on which Frontex operates and gives it more so-called competences. It will, for example, give Frontex the ability to cooperate with third-party countries on behalf of the EU. This proposal is yet another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. The proposal is another step in introducing the European Union’s common immigration and asylum policy as enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. As I will never tire of saying, the Lisbon Treaty was undemocratically imposed on the peoples of Europe without their consent. The Lisbon Treaty was illegal under existing English constitutional law, and everything that stems from it is therefore illegal in England. There is another problem here, which is the European Convention on Human Rights. British courts are obligated to protect the human rights of foreign nationals in the UK. Once in the UK, they only have to claim that their human rights are likely to be at risk in their own country and the courts will not send them home. As a result of this, we have given refuge to all kinds of criminals. If I heard him correctly, Mr Busuttil said that all operations would be suspended while a human rights issue was being considered. This is like baling out a boat with a bucket that has an enormous hole in the bottom. The UK Independence Party will vote against this proposal. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Frontex report because it is nation states and not EU agencies which should control and patrol national borders. Frontex is an affront to British freedom. This latest move is simply a power grab by the EU to give Frontex more money, personnel, equipment and powers. This vote gives the wrong powers to the wrong people. This proposal is another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Galileo programme as an expensive, useless and void EU project which alleges to replace the GPS system and, for example, enhance border security, but, in fact, is an ambitious project which merely seeks to promote the EU brand globally. Taxpayers’ money must be spent on more reasonable projects than sending into space EU-labelled satellites in order to compete with the USA. The purpose of Galileo is to further the EU’s plans for one military force to which I am totally opposed. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against this report as it reflects yet another example of an EU attempt to grab sovereign prerogatives of the nations in the region of the South Pacific. The EU is usurping the right to decide on matters which should remain in the hands of poor communities perfectly capable of managing their fishing and maritime preservation. Poorer nations from the South Pacific should keep the right to use their fishery resources freely to retain their independence and avoid the risk of massive emigration. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I am minded to quote the great American philosopher Murray Rothbard here, that the state is an institution of theft writ large. Tax is just about a system where politicians and bureaucrats steal money from their citizens, to squander in the most disgraceful manner. This place is no exception. Fascinatingly – and I really do not know how they manage to keep a straight face when they are talking about tax evasion – the whole Commission and the Commission bureaucracy avoid their taxes. They do not pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. They have all sorts of special deals – composite tax rates, high tax thresholds, non-contributory pension schemes. They are the biggest tax avoiders in Europe and here they sit pontificating. Well, I would point out to the Commission that the message is getting home to the people of the European Union. You are going to find that Eurosceptics are coming back in June in ever greater numbers. And I can tell you worse: as the people get your number, it will not be long before they storm this Chamber and they hang you, and they will be right. Godfrey Bloom,

. – 
Mr President, not for the first time I rise to give the House the benefit of my 35 years’ experience in financial services – rather more, I suspect, than the rest of you put together. Let me put you right on how this all started. It started with something called the Community Reinvestment Act in the USA, and the reason the whole thing has gone wrong is political interference. We have been talking today, have we not, about due diligence in banking? Well, the Community Reinvestment Act actually stopped banks carrying out due diligence checks. It became illegal to inquire of a borrower whether he could or could not repay the loan, and that is when you saw the invention of subprime mortgages, which had never existed before. It was political interference in the market which caused the subprime crisis. Add to that the bubble in the property market created by criminal, fraudulent central bankers printing money and artificially restraining interest rates, as central banks are still doing now. The US Federal Reserve is still doing it, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England: they are all at it, counterfeiting money. So we are lending money now at far too cheap a rate. We just print more money, and we are going to have another bubble and we are going to do the whole thing all over again! Allow me to close with one point which you clearly do not understand: if it is impossible to foreclose on a mortgage, nobody will give you a mortgage. That is how the market works. Leave it to the market, caveat emptor, and let people get on with it without interference from politicians who, frankly, do not know what they are talking about. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, I wonder if you will permit me to gallop through the working day of the average Englishman. He wakes up and turns on his taxed television to get the news; he leaves his heavily taxed house; gets in his heavily taxed car; he fills it with heavily taxed diesel. He then gets to work to earn an income which, after income tax, employer and employee national insurance, is reduced by a third. He drives home and stops on the high street for a few articles for the house. His purchases are taxed at 20%. He calls in for a pint, over two-thirds of the cost of which goes in tax. He dreams of a family holiday abroad, but he cannot afford the airport tax. He longs for the day that he can retire, but the politicians will not let him go.  We must steal his savings, must we not, through the financial transaction tax? The poor sap does not even know we have nicked it. Of course, with the Commission’s top income-tax-free salaries and non-contributory pension schemes, it is difficult for you to imagine his distress, is it not? You are not in this game, are you? You do not pay any of this. You do not pay any of this. On a more technical note, I draw the House's attention to my own lunatic committee’s Amendment 39 to Article 4a on the withdrawal of legal title to untaxed transactions anywhere in the world. This is sugar in the petrol tank, if you will. We are very much looking forward to the vote. We are watching to see which imbeciles commend it. I suspect it will be usual parliamentarian flat-earthers. Godfrey Bloom,

. – 
Madam President, as a matter of fact, I am not without some sympathy with the Council on this because you are trying to do the impossible. I think Parliament is trying to make you do the impossible.  The long and short of it is – as well known in Austrian economics – that, in order to regulate financial services, you would need perfect knowledge of the market. That is impossible and cannot be done. It is sometimes know as the fatal conceit. What we need to go back to is liberty of contract so that the individual, the investor, can contract under law in a property-owning democracy with whomsoever banker or investment manager he wants, without the interference of the state and the implicit guarantee of the taxpayer that goes with it. Central bankers and retail bankers hide behind regulation. They are not dominated or guided by regulation. It is what keeps these people out of prison when they cheat the general public. You are part of the conspiracy. For goodness sake, move away from prescriptive regulation and let the law of the land take its course. Godfrey Bloom,

Mr President, my sincere apologies for not being on parade. It is quite unlike me. I do apologise for it and thank you for your courtesy. Interesting, is it not, that one of the great political questions in the United Kingdom when it comes to discussion of the euro is: cock-up or conspiracy. Is it a cock-up or is it a conspiracy? We are still arguing about that in the pubs of England. We are not quite sure. It must be completely obvious to anybody with even the remotest bit of economic understanding that this common currency was doomed to failure from the outset if it was not accompanied by fiscal policy. It must have fiscal policy to have one currency and one interest rate. It comes with the package. It must be part of the same phenomenon. The conspiracies theorists say, ah: they knew that this would happen, that this would collapse and that this would bring grief to many countries unfortunate enough and stupid enough to be part of this common currency, and what will happen is, when it collapses – when it catches fire, when it all goes wrong – they can then (‘they’ being the conspirators) push through an undemocratic system of government on people, whether they like it or not. I think this is the first part of it. This is what we are looking at with this document. It is the first bit of an undemocratic procedure so we can cut ordinary voters – members of the electorate – out of the system.

It depends on your perspective really, does it not? I would argue that there is no remit for a common fiscal policy. It has not been put to the people, either in a referendum or in any political way that I can see – certainly not in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, as you know, we have been promised but denied in reality a referendum for many years. I can only speak for the United Kingdom, but I would argue that there is no democratic remit for this and therefore you cannot push a common fiscal policy through. If you ask the people on the streets of Rome or Madrid, or Lisbon or Athens, I think you will get your answer. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Madam President, I find it interesting when I listen to these debates. The House always seems to imagine that there is some huge tree with money on it and you just pick the money off. Well, we have heard all about poverty, we have heard all about unemployment – all of it is true. Perhaps you will bear with me while I explain why. We have a crazy system of both corporate and social welfare. It is a failed post-war experiment. We have a system in the United Kingdom where we pay perfectly fit, healthy young men and women not to work. We import people from Eastern Europe to do that work. So we are pouring money into a complete dead-end of our economy and, in order to pay for it, we have to have things like 20% VAT, monstrous income tax and monstrous national insurance, which actually hamstring the economy from recovering. The only way out of this terrible mess is growth, and we do just about everything we can possibly do here to stop the economy growing. If it is not social welfare, it is corporate welfare. We have a sort of crony capitalism. We do not have real capitalism; it is crony capitalism. I have got landowning friends in Yorkshire, with 1 000 acres of mixed, who get GBP 100 000 a year and a single farm payment. They shove a couple of windmills on it and they are getting GBP 200 000 a year before they get out of bed. Of course people are in food poverty with this crazy system. For goodness sake, get rid of regulation, get rid of tax and free the thing up from this stranglehold, this cancer in society of welfare and get our young people back to work. Godfrey Bloom,

Madam President, Commissioner, I rise again, I am afraid, to make the same old hoary speech that I have been making here for several years. That is: it is my opinion that you do not really understand the concept of banking. All the banks are broke. Bank Santander, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland: they are all broke. And why are they broke? It is not an act of God; it is not some sort of tsunami. They are broke because we have a system called fractional reserve banking, which means that banks can lend money that they do not actually have. It is a criminal scandal and it has been going on for too long. To add to that problem you have moral hazard – a very significant moral hazard – from the political sphere, and most of the problems start in politics and central banks, which are part of the same political system. We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitative easing, but counterfeiting  by any other name – the artificial printing of money for which, if any ordinary person did it,  they would be sent to prison for a very long time. Yet governments and central banks do it all the time. Central banks repress the amount of interest rates so we do not have the real cost of money, and yet we blame the retail banks for manipulating the LIBOR rate. The sheer effrontery of this is quite astonishing. It is central banks that manipulate interest rates, Commissioner. Plus, underneath all this, we talk loosely – in a rather cavalier fashion, do we not – about deposit guarantees. So when banks go broke through their own incompetence and chicanery, the taxpayer picks up the tab. It is theft from the taxpayer. Until we start sending bankers – and I include central bankers and politicians – to prison for this outrage, it will continue. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, what we are dealing with here is a triumph of hope over experience. We are talking about things which are not the problem; the problem which we have is a flawed banking system – a fractional reserve banking system where bankers can lend money that they do not have. If you go back in time to the United States in the 1850s, that was a capital offence. You could hang for it. We have this extraordinary situation where we have had regulation – lots of regulation – which has been the wrong sort of regulation, has it not? And so we have had another disaster. None of this is actually going to save us from another disaster further down the line. It is bound to happen, because we have not addressed the real problems, and that is the EU’s fractional reserve banking system. We must have a commodity bank on the one hand and an investment bank on the other. So, Commissioner, you talk about the banks’ ability to withstand shocks. Well, by that definition – by your definition – a shock is people turning up wanting their money back. That is not a shock; that should be a day-to-day occurrence and should be dealt with accordingly. We are talking about bankers’ bonuses, which is an absolutely wonderful way of taking everybody’s eye off the ball. What we have actually had here is criminal activity by banks – and not a single banker has been sent to prison. That is extraordinary: billions of pounds have been taken away from taxpayers, taken away from depositors and bondholders, and yet not a single banker is in jail. That is a disgrace! We really have to use the law of the land, not so much regulation and printing money – and central banks are equally culpable, make no mistake. I would like to see some central bankers in prison. I call ‘quantitative easing’ counterfeiting. Printing money is counterfeiting. It is illegal; if a private citizen did it, they would go to jail. So let us look into our own hearts. All the very unpleasant arrangements that politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers have between them at the expense of the taxpayer, let us end them and let us end them now. Godfrey Bloom,

Madam President, Commissioner. You know, Mr Draghi, that I am always impressed by your totally non-compromising support for the euro, doomed though we all now know it to be. It appeals to this certain Englishman – there is a sort of Shakespearian quality, I have to say: Lear-like. It puts me in mind of his great speech: ‘I will do such things, – What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be the Terrors of the earth’. Can I make a plea for my friends and their families in Cyprus? A micro-brewer who had his savings in a bank to start a micro-brewing company – not a rich man at all, but of course it was more than EUR 100 000, because it was his life savings. A retired British army officer whose life savings have now all but disappeared in the great Cypriot bank heist. Of course the big boys got their money out early, didn’t they? It is always the little people who get shafted, isn’t it? I am not totally convinced that you really care about them. Can you give me an assurance that you will do whatever it takes to get these poor people’s money back? We now have a situation which the previous speaker, Mr Eppink, alluded to quite rightly: the FED, the Bank of England, the ECB and the Bank of Japan are all completely bankrupt, and they are holding mountains of junk bonds bought with counterfeit money. Let us all blame the retail banks – but it is the central banks where the cancer starts. Politicians, bankers and lackey bureaucrats should be arraigned at an international financial tribunal in The Hague in the same way as war criminals.

 Mr President, well what do we know about carbon dioxide? Not carbon – carbon dioxide is a different thing for those people in this Chamber who have not had the benefit of a formal education. They are different things. We know that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere always follows periods of global warming. We know, do we not, that the hypothesis that man-made global warming was going to cause totally apocryphal boiling in 2050 now is completely nonsense. The hypothesis is dead in the water. It is facedown. There has been no statistically significant global warming now for over fifteen years. There is not a single independent scientific institution which does not acknowledge that fact. So all this debate is a lot of nonsense, because it simply is not happening. And Commissioner, you say that the weather is getting worse and worse; that climate change is getting worse. Madam, where have you been? It has not been. Why are you in denial? You are in denial!

Mr President, let us look at VAT, shall we? What is it really? Well, of course it is a tax, so it is just a form of extortion by the State confiscating money from ordinary working people for the State to spend on itself. It is bureaucracy, politicians, subsidies for cronies and donors to party funds. The tax is regressive and monstrous – 20 % in the United Kingdom. It is inflationary, obviously, with 20 % on all goods. It is closing down retailers in the high street. Manufacturers are on three-day weeks. In the UK manufacturing has fallen 35 % in the last few years.  And what a silly tax it is. It is paid and reclaimed throughout the life of a transaction. It is not applied when value is added, whatever that may mean, but at the end so the customer pays it or simply withdraws his custom. So you get a recession. Notwithstanding the draconian powers given to VAT collectors, worthy of the old East German secret police – and I know some of you want to bring that back – fraud is rife. As criminals are always more clever than politicians – hey, what is the difference? – fraud will remain. If you really want to get rid of fraud, get rid of the tax. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

 Thank you for taking the question. I just thought that as we are talking about waking up and we are talking about climate change, I would draw it to your attention – you keep missing the point I think – that there is no scientific institution now in the world which does not accept that there has been no significance statistical climate change since 1995. I am just wondering when you are going actually to wake up to that fact? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Madam President, I get the impression that Members think that if they use the word ‘growth’ enough, it will somehow magically manifest itself. The reason that growth is unacceptably low is actually quite simple, as anybody from the Pacific Rim could tell us. The reason it is low is that we are overtaxed, overregulated and over-governed. Most Members of this House and the Commission have never had a job in the commercial sector. This is an Achilles’ heel of gargantuan proportions. We have a suicidal energy policy. Employment legislation makes it impossible to employ anybody, especially small businesses and particularly young people. There will be no economic growth until we can close down this place, and the Commission. This is part of the problem. We are the problem and not the solution. Yet perhaps it will close itself down. Perhaps, and maybe sooner than we think. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, we are very interested to see how people vote on what is a very important subject. I draw your attention to Rule 161(5). A little transparency, even in this place, would not go amiss. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Mr President, this is a very complicated subject. Of course the credit rating agencies were not blameless in the subprime crisis, nor in the credit crunch that followed. Lord knows I have castigated them in this Chamber enough, but since 2008 they have improved. They have been honest with the markets about the worthless government debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, if not yet the United Kingdom and the United States.  But are we to crush the rating agencies with regulation?  Recall how they rate government debt: you require the rating agencies to get the prior approval of the regulator, ESMA, for their methodologies so that you can manipulate the calculations behind the scenes. Then, in order to control when they publicise their work, you force the rating agencies to disclose to ESMA the dates on which they are going to provide ratings on government debt and to limit those dates to three times a year. This is so that you will not suffer the embarrassment of a downgrade or negative outlook just before a critical auction of government paper. Then, to control where the rating agencies work, you insist that some of the work is done in the jurisdiction of government debt so that you can intimidate the analysts in the same way that the offices of credit rating agencies have been raided by government bodies in places such as Italy. Then, to control who does the work, you insist not only on the rotation of credit rating agencies themselves, but also on the individual analysts who work and have experience on particular debt and the assets that back them. Finally, to control the purpose of providing credit ratings, you seek to remove references to and reliance upon ratings, both within the workings of government and in private investment funds. Much of this is actually an attack on free speech. The world is watching you, frankly. Can you be trusted? I believe that this is a regulation to castrate the rating agencies and turn them into government eunuchs to vainly protect the chastity of the euro, a currency born out of wedlock and without a dowry. I fear that we will find ourselves back exactly in the position where we started. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I rise somewhat wearily to explain yet again the banking crisis to this House. Banks lend long, but borrow short. Central banks encourage malpractice by printing money – counterfeiting by any other name. Politicians use this fake money to prop up corporate and social welfare, basically bribing people with their own money. Financial regulation has become a shield to protect crooked bankers, while politicians, central and commercial banks spend money they do not have. The problem will simply fester. So what of banking union? Will national parliaments have any say? I take this opportunity to ask, as there are British Conservative colleagues in the House tonight, will Cameron stop this? Will he invoke Article 127 of the TEU or will he, as form suggests, sit like a paralysed rabbit in the EU’s headlights? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a financial transaction tax sounds like a very good idea, does it not? It plays well politically, and we can hit those greedy bankers, whom we all hate in public while we shovel money into their pockets in private. However, I do not think it is quite going to work out that way. All taxes are passed on to customers at the end of the day – sorry everybody, but that is just how it works – so again it will be the little people who pick up the tab. It will be savers, it will be pensioners and it will be ordinary folk who pick up the tab for this tax, not the greedy fat-cat bankers that you are trying to get at. It is interesting, when you look at the small print, to see they are saying that some of the money raised can perhaps go towards saving future failed banks. So we know – we concede, do we not? – that more banks are going to fail. We know this because we have the same ridiculous, fractional-reserve banking system, the same crooked, money-printing, criminal behaviour at the central banks, and so on and so forth. So nothing has changed. This is another strong signal to bankers and politicians to continue the theft. But beware those who think that taxing London is a risk-free game – and we mean London don’t we? When it comes to financial services, other EU countries are Mickey Mouse. Financial services account for 14% of UK GDP, and the UK contributes GBP 50 million pounds a day to this crumbling institution. Do not kill the goose that lays your golden eggs! Zurich, Geneva, New York and Hong Kong are licking their lips wondering what piece of glorious stupidity we will come up with next. An FTT is a special tax, so what next? A special tax on sunshine holidays in Spain; high fashion in Paris; luxury cars in Germany; mobile phones in Finland; and perhaps a justifiably special tax on dreadful flat-pack furniture from Sweden? It is coming to your street next! The greedy bureaucrats just want your money. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– How dare you! You – the British Conservative Party – transferred the regulation of the City of London to this place, and you fiddle about in your silly little committees having betrayed my country. You scoundrel! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Mr Maňka, no, the problem we have is fractional-reserve banking, which means that banks lend money that they do not have, and that central banks and politicians print money, degrading currency. That is your problem. It is not regulation, it is not taxation. It is because of criminal behaviour, frankly, at the world’s central banks. Until that stops, nothing is going to change. There are a lot more bank failures coming down the road, believe me. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, harmonised taxation is simply a ploy to enable bureaucrats to steal even more money from the wealth-creating sector. Like vampires, they prey upon ordinary folk, sucking the lifeblood out of the economy – and for what? Tax-free salaries, non-contributive pension schemes, winter sunshine trips to Durban and Cancún, suicidal remote energy policies and constant rescue packages for failed banks. Without tax competition, Europe would be bled white in pursuit of a maniacal political crusade. High tax would banish manufacturing to the Far East, the Indian subcontinent and North America. The Baltic States, Ireland and fellow entrepreneurial ex-Warsaw Pact countries would slip back into the abyss. Athens and Madrid would become Dublin and Warsaw, but I suspect that before that time, ordinary folk will have cried enough and the parasites will have to head for the hills, as well they may. For certain the Irish, I suspect, will have their own way of dealing with them when they eventually awake from their slumber. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Mr President, in the 1970s the Community Reinvestment Act in the United States made due diligence in banking illegal. To pursue a political goal, the Administration laid open the pathway to what we now know as sub-prime debt. It proved to be – as I said it would at the time – a pathway to hell paved with good intentions. It was conceived to make banks lend to people who could not possibly repay. We politicians now love to blame the banks, but it started with politics. Sadly, politicians do not understand money. How else could we have got ourselves into this appalling mess? Yet we have learnt nothing; we are now advocating a form of Eurobond, a sub-prime debt instrument by any other name. Again, we are bailing out the banks at the expense of the taxpayer. The ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed are all at it: print money; give it to the banks to buy junk bonds – bogusly rated as double A – to shore up their reserves and guarantee salaries and bonuses that ordinary people can only wonder at. We have learnt nothing from the 2008 crisis. We are desperately clinging to a failed political ideal as our cities riot and burn. The day must surely come when politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers must be called to account by a fiscal crimes tribunal and sent to prison for a very long time. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
),  
Blue-card question. 
– 
Mr President, as a supporter and sponsor of Cambridge University’s Ladies’ Rugby Club for, I guess, 15 to 20 years, I wonder whether they should wear the logo on the front of their shirts or on the back? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I hope I may call you ‘shipmate’ in private! I would like to welcome the President of the Bank and to thank him for turning up, even if nobody else has. I have read this report, unlike most of my colleagues probably: power to suspend credit ratings, a European Monetary Fund to exclude the IMF, a single European Treasury issuing eurobonds and a single European Finance Minister, all of which, of course, would be unelected. It is a manifesto for European economic dictatorship, which is why I rather suspect the British Conservative Party will welcome it with open arms. If they do not vote for it, they will abstain in a marked manner, as they usually do, and talk a good story back in London. The President of the Bank reminds me a little bit of the poem by Siegfried Sassoon, the great war poet: ‘He’s a cheery old card’ said Harry to Jack, ‘As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack, But he did for them both with his plan of attack’. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, Ms Gáll-Pelcz mentioned the purchase of risky assets and I am a little bit confused. I am a professional economist. With whose money would you buy these risky assets? With whose money? Where would you get the money? Is it from old age pensioners in Yorkshire – my constituency – on GBP 100 per week? Where are you going to get the money to save this already failed project? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I certainly do not want it to fail but there is a feeling in the House that we have been hit by an asteroid or a tsunami, that this is not a problem of our own making. The reason the country and the European Union is in a shambles over the euro is of our own making: we have brought this upon ourselves. It is not an act of God. When will this House wake up to the fact we have done it to ourselves? Wake up, I beg you! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, one thing we do know about climate is that it is a pretty odd old thing. We know that it was warmer on the globe in the Holocene period; we know it was warmer in the Roman period; we also know it was warmer in the medieval period. It was cooler in the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century. We also know there has been no significant change in climate over the last 6 000 years and we also know that most scientific organisations have confirmed that there has been no significant statistical global warming in the last 15 years? I have these figures in front of me. They are the same figures that Mr Davies quoted. He is very careful in what he selects. What I would like to suggest before everybody disappears to Durban, saving the world as they travel on first class airfares and sip their martinis in expensive hotels, is that I have old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week … and you are picking up the tab. I would suggest, given this fiscal crisis that we have, that it would be a nice gesture – particularly from you, Commissioner, who does not pay much income tax and is on a very good salary – for you to offer to pay for your own trip. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, it is a shame that the Commissioner has gone. He would learn so much from me, since, unlike most of the people here, I actually have commercial experience. I have actually run companies. I actually know what I am talking about. I am going to talk about jobs now. We have 40% youth unemployment in parts of the European Union, and it is being suggested by people here that this is some sort of act of God. It is not an act of God: it is sheer, unadulterated incompetence. Look at what the EU is doing. Look at the barriers it is putting in front of companies, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, preventing them from employing people. We have minimum wages. We have pensions. We have holiday entitlements. We have a job tax – called national insurance in my country – which is absolutely huge, so the employee does not actually get half the money that is being paid by the employer. Trying to get rid of lazy and incompetent workers is virtually impossible, so sacking people is very difficult. And if you cannot hire, you cannot fire, so you lose flexibility. We have maternity leave, paternity leave, stress leave and all the rest of the nonsense that is invented by people here who have absolutely no commercial experience at all. It is not an accident that we have 40% of our young people unemployed: it is your fault. And let me remind you of liberty of contract. In a free society, we should have liberty of contract so that an employer and an employee can get together, sign a contract and get on with their lives without interference from this place. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, Mr Sturdy is an eminent businessman very close to where I live. He is one of the few exceptions and I apologise to him. (Laughter) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I rise with some humility as representing a country which managed to elect a Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, a Scotsman, the only Scotsman in the world who actually does not care how much money he spends: it is an interesting phenomenon! So as I say, I rise with some humility. However, I look forward with the great British sense of humour which is one thing nobody can take away from us in this place which gave us an energy policy, an employment policy, a fisheries policy, an agricultural policy that have been – as almost everything that this place has done has been – a complete and total disaster. We are now contemplating a response to disasters, most of which of course we create for ourselves in this place. So I can say I look forward to seeing how this develops, how it goes forward in the future, and I am just interested to see what kind of pig’s breakfast you are going to make of this one! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I am a baby boomer. I was born just after the war. From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally. I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on – largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned. I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard. It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt. Let me explain, because I do not think you really understand. It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation – more money than they can possibly raise in taxation –, most of which, in point of fact, they actually waste. The reason we are talking about countries which are broke – and they are broke – is because their ridiculous, ineffective, ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise. Then they borrow, and they borrow, and – worse – they then print money, because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money. If you do that as a private citizen, it is a criminal offence. You would go to prison for that, yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time. Let me explain to you that these countries are broke. They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians. It is immoral – immoral! – to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks. They have defaulted. They are broke. For God’s sake, let us all admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Absolutely right. I was not suggesting my politicians were any less stupid than anybody else. It is an absolute disgrace, and there was not even a debate in our national parliament on actually rescuing these bust banks. If you want to invest in bust banks, do so with your own money, not money from my old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week, you scoundrels! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I rise before the House today to mention one or two things which might perhaps be of help. I spent 35 years as an investment banker, investment manager, investment adviser and economic strategist, and I never bought a dud bank in my life. I never bought a dud bank for my clients, but over the past few years, I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head, as a taxpayer, and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at. These are not even British dud banks, they are foreign dud banks, and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal. If I want to invest overseas, I will buy an emerging markets fund. I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force. I say ‘Mickey Mouse bank’, Mr Maystadt, because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life. I do not know where you get your advice from, but statistically, the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years, so what are you going to shovel all this money into? I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people. I would counsel you, if you want to keep your AAA status, to ignore the pleas of this House – full of eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives – in particular, in relation to paragraph 48 of the report. Solar panels in the land of the wildebeest, giraffe and bongo drum will lose you your AAA rating in no time at all. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
–
 Mr President, I would like to go back to the matter of Libya if I may. When did the political class and the great and the good suddenly catch up with the fact that Colonel Gaddafi is an evil man? When, since that wonderful photograph with you embracing him, Mr President, did you suddenly come to realise that he was a “wrong’un”? I can tell you that the victims of Lockerbie in Scotland and the victims of IRA atrocities in my country knew very well what sort of scoundrel this man was. But he has got oil and he has got money so you all turned a blind eye, didn’t you? Well, the chickens have come home to roost. The most absurd figure in all this is the British Prime Minister, who stands there rattling his empty scabbard – having disestablished the Royal Navy, having disestablished the Royal Air Force – making threats from the sidelines, with no aircraft carriers, nothing, and calls himself a Conservative but is just a superannuated schoolboy whistling in the dark. We talk a great deal about violence against the people, we talk a lot about democracy. And yet we have had a homicidal baboon in Zimbabwe for years now, and we do not do anything about it, do we? We do not care because there is no money and there is no oil. That is so typical of this place: full of hypocrisy and humbug. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have been here six and a half years, and, my goodness, I have heard some nonsense. But I have not heard so much nonsense spoken as I have today. Many years ago, I used to lecture on this subject at Cambridge University, and I would suggest that you would do well to read some of my old lecture notes. None of you, it appears, seems to understand the concept of international money. Herr Brok, who has not come off the phone since he came in only to listen to himself, was rather interesting. He started off this debate by suggesting it was a great success – the euro. One wonders what planet Herr Brok lives on. Dear oh dear! It is a complete disaster. If he thinks it is such a success, I would argue that he speak to the millions of unemployed people, youngsters mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the rest of Europe, who are suffering from this disgraceful, fraudulent and deceitful currency which was rammed down the throats of the people of Europe against their will. There is no mandate, Mr Duff. There is no mandate, with your blue card hanging up there, let me tell you. There is no mandate for this. The British people have not been given a vote on this whole shebang of European Union, and neither has anybody else. There is only one way this ridiculous currency spanning many different economies against a whole background of failed ideals can survive – and if you understood international money to any degree, you would understand this – and that is by having a financial, central, statist fiscal policy. If you think you have a mandate for that, you are a disgrace and a scoundrel. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I have to say to Mr Duff that at the time, in the mid-1990s, some of the class greeted my views with some scepticism. I still now go back to the occasional reunion dinner and most of them come up to me and say, ‘My god, Godders, you were right’. And I am, by god! I was right in spades, was I not? (Applause) Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, there is a lot of self-congratulation going on here in the European Union on International Women’s Day. It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog’s breakfast of it. You talk about maternity leave. All that is happening with draconian maternity leave, let me tell you, Madam, is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business. So you have done them no favours. We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court, which means that even if young women could get a job, they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled. And now you are talking about quotas. What kind of madness is this? Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business – professional women – are being patronised on quotas. Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say, are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business? The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this is simply not true and is not borne out by the statistics in my country. Speak to any small businessman you like in my country. I am not interested in the honourable Member’s country or other people’s countries, I am interested in my country and my economy, and I can tell you that all businessmen and women will say that they will not employ young women because of the draconian maternity laws. I wish, I desperately wish, you would come into the real world; hands up any of you who have had a real job! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Oviir, I would simply counsel her to let companies do their business. The less you regulate, the less you tax, the less you interfere, the quicker our economy will recover. That is what it is all about, and that is something the honourable Member does not understand. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Estrela, I can assure her that the problem with my country is that we have given up self-government and we are Members of the European Union: that is my country’s problem. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki, I would say that I believe that children are the responsibility of their parents and nobody else. I do not accept that somebody takes responsibility for his neighbour’s children. It is for the parents to take responsibility for their children and that is how it should be. The more self-responsibility we had in Europe – and indeed, the world – the better it would be, in my view. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– The views expressed by Herr Schulz meet the case. He is an undemocratic fascist. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, yet again there is one rule for Herr Schulz and one rule for everybody else. This is a disgrace. I have been elected – re-elected – to vote in this Chamber by the people of Yorkshire (your own constituency, I might add), with a democratic mandate which you yourself do not enjoy, Mr President, because you switched parties and they voted for the Conservatives. I have no intention of apologising, I have no intention of leaving this Chamber: you must have me escorted out, Sir! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, about five and a half years ago, I caused something of a furore by suggesting that any small businessman with his brain in the right place would be mad to employ a woman of childbearing age. Since then, it has got worse and worse as the balance in favour of employees versus employers has got completely out of control. One of my constituents from York wrote to me last year saying never mind about employing women of childbearing age, any small businessmen who employs anybody has got to be out of his mind. We have an extraordinary situation here, do we not? We have young women desperately keen to get into work, desperately keen to work for companies, especially small companies – which are the driving force of the United Kingdom economy – and we have employers who are too terrified to take them on. That is the problem we have. We are making it – here in this place with so little commercial experience amongst our Members – almost impossible for small businesses to employ young women, which is something they want to do. I used to think it was some sort of Chinese conspiracy where this place made it almost impossible for a European economy to function, and that behind the scenes the Chinese were making it so bad that eventually we had to import absolutely everything from China. Well, I have another hypothesis here, namely, that perhaps the women who are making it so difficult in committees, in the Commission and in this place for small businesses to employ young women have an eye to the main chance. I would suggest that when the electorate quite rightly look at them and boot them out in a few years’ time for their incompetence and their stupidity, they will only be able to get back into the workplace because they are in middle or late middle age. The game will be cleared for them. That is my hypothesis. I can think of no other sensible answer to this sort of ludicrous interference between employer and employee. If you think that is a weird hypothesis, anything that puts up with the way you talk about climate change, believe me, nothing is too stupid for this Chamber. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, when last I met the Commissioner, I expressed grave concern that regulation of the City of London was going to move to Brussels. He seemed surprised that I was so concerned, but since he has taken office, he might have come to understand that a significant portion of the United Kingdom’s GDP actually comes from its financial services sector. It is very important to the United Kingdom. Indeed, it picks up most of the tabs. The GBP 45 million a day we send to this place to support the rather suspicious European Union project, which has not given any of our electorate an actual say, is one of those tabs. In fact, you must understand that big salaries and big pensions do not grow on trees. Commissioner, I also mentioned to you that we could learn something from the old dominions – Australia, Canada – who have not suffered from this problem, and you rather charmingly, and in a very Gallic way, suggested that Australia was a long way away. I hope, now that you have been in office for a little while, you will understand that perhaps such a parochial approach will not do. I still worry, Commissioner. I still fret that we will have regulation from the usual mishmash of ignorant bureaucrats, parliamentary committees with their usual complement of cryptocommunists, anachronistic socialists, journeymen politicians, fringe greenies, a sprinkling of well-meaning housewives, and grandmothers exploring their new third age. The outcome will be the same as all the other EU projects: fishing, agriculture, energy, employment, immigration and, horror of horrors, the ticking time bomb of the single currency. It is an astonishing litany, is it not, of failure? You would think the European Union would get something right once by accident. I am sorry, but I am not satisfied. I am desperately cross that the British Conservative Party has given away the City of London regulation. If Dave Cameron had been the Admiral at Trafalgar, it would be Admiral Villeneuve on the plinth in Trafalgar Square now. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Commissioners – the three amigos if I may call you such – last session, Mr President, you had to scamper away. I think you had an urgent appointment. You missed my words of wisdom and I am glad to see that you are here to receive them today because I feel I have some wisdom to offer. You are in such a pickle actually, are you not? One could almost feel sorry for you but of course, you know, you bring some of this on yourselves. The common currency experiment – which is an experiment that was doomed to failure; I remember lecturing at Cambridge University back in the 1990s, explaining why it was deeply flawed and could not work and I gave it about 10 years and I am afraid it looks as though I was right – was flawed even by your own rule book. What in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book. You threw it away! You welcomed every fiscal dysfunctional economy into the eurozone, including Greece – which was going to hasten the demise of the eurozone, and it thus comes as no surprise. I am not a johnny-come-lately to the demise of the euro. It was always written in the runes, as it were. To suggest now that we have only just found out that Greece was broke is intellectually dishonest. I was in the City at the time and we were buying Greek bonds at 10% coupons, they fell to five and it was a one-way bet – a bit like having the winner of the horse before the race had even started! Our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy junk debt. They redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple A ratings. What are our central banks doing now? The very same thing. They are buying in the secondary market and buying junk bonds, repackaging them as triple A. This is just how we got into this pickle to start with. If you want to get out of this mess, you need to get rid of the political-establishment support for commercial banks and get rid of central banks, which are actually part of the problem, not the solution. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment. He who pays the piper calls the tune. It inevitably led to misgrading. Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet. They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all. Paradoxically, it is usually the hedge funds who find out the truth behind the numbers. They exposed Enron, for example. But the truth about numbers can be unpopular, especially here, which is why we hate them. However, even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke. Kaput
 is kaput
 in any language! So what does this House propose? Our own credit rating agency paid for by us, guaranteed to dance to our tune. It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone’s failed economies. The question is, who would these fool? I suggest, with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents, virtually nobody. When the people of Europe realise that they have been the guinea pigs in a gigantic failed currency experiment, they will burn this place down and guillotine the lot of us, and who could blame them? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Madam President, it is a shame that Mr Barroso has fled the Chamber. I feel he would have learned so much from me this evening! I would counsel you all not to worry too much about the EU in 2020 because I rather fancy it will not be here! It will go the same way as the Soviet Union which it so resembles, and for the same reasons: it is centralised; it is corrupt; it is undemocratic and it is incompetent; it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats; it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as ‘climate change’. Whenever the people of Europe get the chance of a referendum, they reject it. The British, of course, have not been given the chance to have their say, thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country, aided and abetted by an EU-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the BBC. The EU is already crumbling. The scenes in Greece today will spread through the other Mediterranean countries sooner than we can imagine, and they will eventually reach northern European countries, which are being left to pick up the tab. Our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, I appear to have been living in some sort of parallel universe here, hearing about the success of the euro. Let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we? Unemployment, youth unemployment in the Iberian Peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic. It has been at 30-40% for years. Nothing to do with the crisis at all. A complete disaster. GDP per capita in the USA is miles ahead of the European Union. GDP in the Pacific Rim is miles ahead of the GDP in the Union. No, the euro has not been successful at all. It is already failing. It is already crumbling before our eyes. Just look at some economic basics. There is no lender of last resort, which is why we have this Greek crisis and a Portuguese crisis round the corner. There is no lender. This is impossible in global, in currency management, whether it is an optimal currency zone or not. There is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak. Let me just remind everybody here about something else if I may. There are two sorts of people: wealth creators, those people that go out and work in the private sector and create wealth, and there are the others who spend wealth, which are politicians and bureaucrats and there are too many of us. Far too many of us. We are the monkey on the economies’ back and, until these currency zones start cutting down public sector spending, it is going to get worse and worse and worse. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, a few weeks ago, my estimable friend and Yorkshire colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, brought the chairman of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to this assembly and presented him as a legend in his own lunchtime and a top climate science guru – and I have to say that he certainly looked like a guru to me – but it turns out that he is a railway engineer who writes mucky books. Now, I have nothing against railway engineers. Some of my best friends are railway engineers and no doubt they read mucky books – that is not the point – but it might explain perhaps, does it not, why the IPCC has come out with so much absurd nonsense in the last few years. Would it not be a good idea if the Commission, perhaps, were to write to the IPCC and suggest they get a new chairman, perhaps a tad better qualified? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, taxation as a concept has not really changed very much in the last 3 000 years, has it? The rich and the powerful stealing money from ordinary people to make their own lives more comfortable. Where there has been a change in modern times is that now taxation is ‘for the benefit of the taxed’: that somehow we are being taxed pro bono
. In order to perpetuate this myth, we invent periodic scares to frighten people into submission. The latest of these scares is of course that, if we do not cough up green taxes, we will all boil to death – reminiscent of the medieval religions, is it not, which played the same game: pay up or burn in hell. Tax harmonisation is a concept dreamed up by the modern political class to make sure that no government steals too little from its people: a sort of thieves’ cartel if you will. May I suggest, if you really want tax harmonisation, that the Commission and the bureaucracy pay the same taxes as the electorate, that they bear the same burden of tax as the rest of us, before the electorate storm this building and hang us from the rafters, as they have every right to do. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, you can, of course, tell that I am a sceptic because I do not dress like a scarecrow. I fought my way through the blizzard in Copenhagen, like many of you did. It is interesting, is it not, that we have had the coldest winter so far on record in London for 30 years? It is the same in Poland, Korea and China. We have had the coldest temperatures in Florida, Arizona, Texas – the first snow in Texas, I think, for a hundred years. Of course, as Giles Coren of the London Times
 said, my goodness me, we simply do not get it – of course that is what global warming is all about: we have got to get used to freezing temperatures. Well, we have seen the Al Gore hockey stick, which is still, I gather, being shown in London state schools – Al Gore, snake oil salesman, crook! We have seen Professor Jones from the University of East Anglia – crook! And now – you will not know about this yet because it has been kept out of the public domain – the New Zealand National Climate Database: I have the figures here – all fraudulent. When are you all going to wake up? Scam, scam, scam! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Climate, Mr Davies, is what we all have to put up with. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, I rise very quickly and on a point of order. You said a few minutes ago that you were bound by the rules, and what can you do when you are bound by the rules? I fully understand that, and so does the House. Can I assume, and can we assume, that you will be bound by the rules of this House for your whole term of office? Because your predecessor felt he was not bound by the rules, and on the basis of explanations of vote he tore the rule book up because he did not feel bound by it. I leave it with you, sir. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, I take this opportunity of wishing well the east European cities in the coming of the very early skiing season, with the snow and ice that have come there. Of course, this is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, and temperatures have been broadly flat since 1998. So we are all talking here about something which is not happening. Time and time again I have heard Members here talk of CO2
 as a pollutant. A pollutant! It is a life-giving natural gas. It gives me the impression that some of our Members have not had the benefit of a formal education. Isn’t this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people’s trouser pockets to steal yet more tax from them? Isn’t this all about political control? Isn’t this all about politics and big business? The whole thing is a sham – this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2
 is causing global warming. Enough please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy. Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, the influx of workers into the UK must be controlled by the UK Government. It is a simple matter of sovereignty. Britain already has a housing shortage. Hospitals and schools are not coping with the ever-growing immigrant population. Britain must protect its own citizens who have paid their taxes and built the country. The massive influx of immigrants produces an oversupply, adding to the unemployment problem, reducing job availability and reducing pay for working people. And yet, here we are facing yet more rules. These rules take control away from UK authorities, making management of the infrastructure impossible. Britain has not discriminated against foreign workers, and those willing to integrate with the existing population have been accepted, but now enough is enough. You say the free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom of EU citizens, a cornerstone of the internal market. I say a fundamental right of the UK is to roll away this stone and gain independence from Europe. We need our independence now. Sadly, a great British trade unionist and defender of working people, Bob Crow, died today. I wish the Left would embrace his views in this debate. Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, the Fourth Railway Package removes choice and dictates how to run a railway. Currently, Member States choose to directly award public service contracts or organise competitive tenders. This is yet another EU one-size-fits-all imposition inflicted on the UK, stopping any government from even considering alternatives to the current failed UK privatised model of railways.  So this EU package imposes: one, a dramatic cost escalation due to fragmentation; two, tax increases due to private train company subsidies; three, passengers facing the highest rail fares in Europe; four, minimal investment because profits are given to shareholders instead of reinvesting.  Directly-operated railways on the East Coast mainline prove that publicly owned and operated railways deliver increased performance, with much lower subsidy than private operators. UK governments must have the freedom to implement alternative models in line with the interests of passengers and of taxpayers. The UK Government must run its own affairs without EU interference in UK sovereignty. All the UK really needs is independence. Mike Nattrass  (EFD
). - 
  Mr President, here we have more legislation from the EU sausage machine to waste UK civil servants’ time and confuse citizens. I have listened to debates on the length of chickens’ beaks, inquiries into how much wine there is in a wine[nbsp ]gum and facts about rotten fruit leading to drunken reindeer which then savage people. The message-tapping CIA must be bored out of their tiny minds. You would serve your countries better by staying at home and chewing cardboard. There was a time when the British thought the Italians were amusing: ignoring the rules after making so many. We now understand that an over-supply of silly rules leads to disrespect for the law, and pedestrian crossings become suitable only for those with a suicidal tendency. We have far too much law. EU rules are openly broken and are not enforced by the Commission. This puts those who obey the rules into an adverse trading position. The failure to enforce EU law on the size of chicken cages, causing problems with egg production, is just one very costly example. Should you have further rules and mad-cap ideas up your sleeves, I suggest you shove them up your armholes or, like the Italians, make love not law. UKIP backs Westminster as the place where UK law must be made. For these reasons, UKIP will vote against this new law. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, you will be aware that many in the UK object – object – to the imposed EU citizenship and do not want it. They love Europe but they hate the EU because it is dictatorial and undemocratic. The following letter from constituent Alan Sheath illustrates this point. ‘Dear Mr Nattrass, on 7 February 1992, Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty. Unbeknown to myself and the vast majority of British subjects, every person in the UK, including Her Majesty The Queen, became a European citizen by ratification. Neither I nor 60 million other British subjects were consulted or asked to vote. I do not want this citizenship, so please advise me what measures there are in place to renounce it. I remain content with my British birthright’. I see from the papers on this debate that the EU is now forcing the UK to wreck its social security systems by opening the floodgates to Europe and the UK is being forced to abide by the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We do not want foreign legal frameworks, so when can the British people have a democratic vote please? Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, between 1958 and 1976, Iceland fought the cod wars with Britain. Now, cod stocks are rising because of Icelandic fish management. Compare that with the former UK fishing grounds, now in EU hands. Lost and ruined. The UK’s European dream turned into a nightmare. Established fishing communities die when the EU boats move in. My message to Iceland is obvious. If you join, you will lose your fish, your freedom and your currency and there is no regard for quotas or regulations in the EU. For the love of cod, do not do this. Say no. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Madam President, increasing the independence and powers of national bodies is good. The failings of the railway package are laughable, and the share of freight being moved by rail has actually fallen since the first railway package in 2001. Are the EU regulations enforced? The Commission will not enforce the regulations on battery cages for hens, which may well force producers who have complied out of business. So what is this about enforcement? Will cash-strapped national governments pay their fines? Some pay fines then continue to break the same rule, because the annual revenue collected exceeds the amount of the annual EU fine. The Commission has taken 13 Member States to the European Court of Justice for failing to correctly implement various parts of the railway package. Was anything enforced? Here, the EU sought control over national policy-making decisions on railways: for example, stopping the political will to run nationalised railways. These are matters of national sovereignty and the freedom of the voters – not the EU. The report criticises Member States for lack of investment to meet this package, but we are in the middle of an economic crisis. The legislation does not require clarification or improvement. It clearly should be scrapped. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President: So the EU seeks to raise EU revenue by taxation on trucks? Well, I ask UK voters what they think of the EU and the usual answer is ‘I do not think we should join’. The UK has been politically taken over. UK law is made in Strasbourg, a monster red-tape factory is closing industry, and now we have tax but, because it is not football, the people are not informed. The UK media avoid EU reality, brains are fed with TV soaps and reporters say the EU does not affect local issues. The EU is not news. This report seeks to raise tax from tolls on trucks, partly funding the trans-European TEN-T project, which includes linking high-speed EU trains. So, when the EU raises taxes in the UK, will the people respond by kicking the EU in the ballot box? No, because they are not informed. The final EU superstate takeover by stealth will be a taxpayers’ sleepwalk into Europe. The defences are down, the press do not care and the UK is asleep, so get those unfortunate truckers taxed. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, Mrs Kalniete wants to relaunch the Single Market and makes it sound like a V-2 rocket: extremely dangerous but never on target. Mr Correia de Campos is concerned about movement of workers. Well, so am I. The EU has swamped the United Kingdom with extra workers. The United Kingdom sees the world as the market. The straightjacket of the EU regulation is closing our industry, stopping innovation when it is ahead of the regulations and closing traditional industry, where the product is good but different from the approved continental version. Small business is the victim here. The United Kingdom is amongst those which do comply, yet it suffers because it does: for example, expensive compliance in the pig and egg industries with regulations that the Commission will not enforce, making our product uncompetitive. I have many more examples, but have been allocated just one minute to save small businesses. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, in view of what we have just been speaking about, I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us. I would like your reassurance that the investigation into Brussels security breaches, some involving firearms, is being vigorously pursued. These breaches have put our staff, our guests and ourselves at serious risk. May I also have your assurance that senior management will be held accountable where appropriate, and that these soldiers will not be sacrificed in order to protect the generals? (Applause) Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages, but it is about the ability of the EU to oversee the single market. States were given 10 years to comply by 1 January 2012 or the product would be illegal. The Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, British and others have complied, but certain large producers have simply refused. This involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money. The regulation has put about 15 pence on a dozen eggs. Those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage. Eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the EU. One producer borrowed GBP 10 million to comply with this directive. He did the right thing. Is the Commission going to renege and make his eggs uncompetitive? If more time is given, then the moral of this story is that, if the EU makes a directive, it pays to ignore it. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, the Commission proposed this directive in 2008 and there were concerns about placing excessive burdens on the scientific research industry. The proposal will dilute certain restrictions and I note that the requirement for sharing animal research data has been removed. Some 12 million animals are being used in experiments in the EU each year and this proposal could increase their suffering. We must reduce the need for experimentation on animals. Civilised human beings will try to strike a balance between the need for research and the obligation to respect the lives of other creatures on this planet. These decisions require the wisdom of Solomon. I regret, I have to say, I have to ask the question: does the EU Parliament have such wisdom? Mike Nattrass,

 Madam President, the British public are aggressively against whaling. If Britain’s hands are tied to one harmonised EU abstention on whaling, it will guarantee a return to slaughter. The inhumane Japanese are giving incentives to Third World countries to stop: and look at the return to whaling. It is murder. The Japanese Government should be regarded as socially unacceptable for doing this in a modern world. The British were once heavily involved but have consigned the mistake to a previous century. If the UK is stopped by the EU from voting against this, while the Japanese and others murder these beautiful, sensitive and intelligent mammals, the UK public will vote to leave the EU in uncontrollable anger. It will be the kiss of death for Britain’s membership of the EU. John Stuart Agnew, Marta Andreasen, Gerard Batten, John Bufton and Mike Nattrass  (EFD

– Mr President, to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom, the UK Government has implemented the EU rail package. This is mainly because, these days, the Lib-Lab-Con sit at Westminster and like to be told what to do, having given away control to the EU. The separation of train operators and separation of the rail network is leading to major problems, courtesy of the EU. No wonder 21 countries are too wise to get caught in an EU rail web leading to mayhem on all stations to Brussels. I am not a Socialist, but if you need an integrated transport system, then state ownership is best – and not separation into multiple private hands. Having six different companies on the network between Birmingham and Berlin will create a complete ‘dog’s breakfast’, or should I say a ‘Dachshunds Frühstück
’. When Eurorail is broken up to allow the surplus capacity to be run by different companies, we will no longer have rolling stock, just laughing stock. Brian Simpson, who is responsible for this debate, is a member of the Labour Party. Labour was once Socialist, and he was elected by people who still think Labour is Socialist. Yet here he is, hiding in the EU, away from his faithful supporters. What is he calling for? He is calling for privatisation. More than that; he is calling for an EU model which does not work and is against the wishes of his own voters. He is, in fact, the ‘Fat Controller’, creating fat pay packets for fat cats. The one thing that we can be sure of is that there is fat chance that this EU directive will be accepted, as it will derail the EU rail network. Mike Nattrass,

– Madam President, I come from the West Midlands, the home of the so-called ‘Tipton Taliban’, who were detained at Guantánamo. As a UKIP MEP, I must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another, without judicial oversight, and to face foreign imprisonment, is an alien process. It is an affront to liberty, democracy, accountability and natural human rights. I can give you a list of British citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way, into squalid and unfit jails, not at the hands of the CIA and its rendition programme, but at the hands of the EU Member States under the European arrest warrant which this House created. It was made in the EU. So, before you condemn the USA, look in the mirror and see your own hypocrisy.

 Mr President, in his introduction President Barroso said that the First World War was an industrial war. Indeed, you have only got to drive two hours up the A4 motorway from here and visit the battlefield at Verdun to see exactly what he was talking about.  For those who have not visited, I think it is probably the grimmest battlefield on the Western Front or indeed anywhere in the world, and certainly the grimmest I have visited. It was something that had such a huge psychological effect on France that it very much dominated the thinking of Monnet and Schuman post-1945 – that this awful thing must never happen again. Those of us in politics will all remember that famous photograph of a quite large German Chancellor Kohl and a rather small French President Mitterrand holding hands, standing in front of the ossuary at Douaumont. The whole European project comes from the disaster that was sparked by the First World War. It is entirely understandable that people should have sought ways to prevent such awfulness. The difficulty is that they chose the wrong target. Monnet and Schuman decided – and this view is shared today by Mr Barroso, Mr[nbsp ]Cohn-Bendit and others – that it was the existence of the nation state that led to war and therefore we had to abolish the nation state. Actually, what we should have focused on, post-1945, was not the abolition of states, but making sure that the European states were democratic, because democratic nation states do not go to war with each other. So I have to say that I believe the whole European project is based on a falsehood. It is potentially a dangerous falsehood, because if you try to impose a new flag, a new anthem, president, army, police force, foreign policy – and whatever else – without first seeking the consent of the people, you are in danger actually of creating the very nationalisms and resentments that you sought to snuff out in the first place. We have done all this before. We did it after the First World War in the Balkans. We said that we could not have all these little Balkan states going around fighting with each other. We said that we should bring them together and give them one flag, one anthem and one president and call it Yugoslavia. It led to horrific wars from 1990 and the deaths of tens of thousands of people, as they fought to get out of a false state.  The European Union is making a very similar mistake, because there is no consent for this project. I have heard people this morning talking about the need for a United States of Europe on a federal model. You can only have that if people give consent for it, and nobody has done so. When the EU put the constitution to the peoples of Europe – the first time it really came clean with the electors – they rejected it.  I am not against Europe, but I am against this Europe. I want a Europe of independent, sovereign nation states that trade together, work together and cooperate together. I believe the European elections this year will mark a turning point. The tide is turning. The EU is backing an outdated model that seeks to get rid of a problem that actually has not existed since 1945. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, even by the standards of this place, today’s atmosphere has been leaden. A great global political leader, Mr Barroso, comes along and out of 750 Members, 44 people turn up to listen. Why is that? Well, I have noticed something: I have been here fifteen years, but in the last five years something really big has changed. The European dream is crumbling, absolutely crumbling. There are a few maniacs in the front row here and in your Commission who of course still want a United States of Europe, but actually out there in the Member States they do not. And most of the MEPs here, yes, they want a job, yes, they want to be re-elected, but the enthusiasm for this project is dying. Why? Well you have made two big mistakes. The first mistake was of course to extend the eurozone. It would have been OK had it just been Germany and a few northern European countries, but to bring the Mediterranean into the eurozone has been a disaster. The second mistake was to allow the free movement of people to southern and to Eastern Europe. We in the United Kingdom – who have been the most open country with regard to immigration of any European country through a history that has lasted hundreds of years – now have 4[nbsp ]000 migrants a week who come to Britain from the European Union and stay for a year or more. These are the two realities that have hit home to people: the EU does not work economically, and open-door migration is fundamentally changing societies in ways that people do not want. Listen to the economics. Mr Barroso, you talked today about the possibility of an industrial renaissance in Europe, which sounded good. Lighter-touch regulation – all very encouraging. And then you say: but we must pursue our climate-change carbon targets. The Americans have gone for shale gas and reduced energy prices. The Chinese are digging up coal in quantities we cannot fathom and building two coal-fired power stations every week. This policy of economic unilateralism on climate change is what is destroying jobs in Europe, and the electors are going to have a chance in 72 days’ time to give their verdict. I suspect the next European Parliament will be very much more exciting than this one has been this morning. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Had there been a proper question there, I might try to answer it. Euroscepticism is growing right across the European Union. Nobody here, not even the maniacs that believe in the project, would question that. It is coming in all shapes and forms. It is on the right, it is in the centre, and it is on the left. The reason is of course – and you come from Ireland, so you should know better than anybody – that actually no one has ever given consent for a political European Union. The French clearly – followed by the Dutch – rejected the Constitution. They rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty, and only one country had a referendum on that. That was Ireland, and the people of Ireland rejected it. So you cannot tell me that there is popular support for a United States of Europe. Mrs Reding may believe it, Mr Barroso may believe it, one or two in the front row may believe it, but the peoples of Europe do not believe it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I have sat here this morning feeling like the odd man out. To me it is beyond parody for the Greek Finance Minister, Mr Kourkoulas, to come along here and tell us our fortune: the policies are bearing fruit, we are going to tackle unemployment. And no-one says anything! No, because, of course, everybody here is tied up with the same obsession that the euro must and will work; the obsession that you will use the crisis to build a United States of Europe. What you could have told them, Mr[nbsp ]Kourkoulas, is that, according to the respected medical journal The Lancet
, there are now 800[nbsp ]000 people in Greece without access to welfare or medical care. You could have told them that. But even if you had, they would not have listened, so obsessed are they with building the euro. OK, a simple lesson in economics: when you have two countries that are at completely different stages of the economic cycle, one currency needs to devalue. But if those countries are pegged or tied inside the same currency and they cannot devalue, you have to devalue the country – and that is what is happening to the Mediterranean. We are devaluing the Mediterranean, and it is leaning towards Third World status. No amount of socialist state spending can mend this imbalance. It is about time, if people here cared for the citizens of Europe, particularly in the south, that we admitted the euro does not work for southern Europe and it is time we broke it up and gave countries currencies that reflect their current economic status.

 The point that the late Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, made is that it is tough enough to have an interest rate that works for Newcastle and London, let alone to have one that works across the whole of Europe, so there is a valid economic argument.  However, the taxpayers in London do not object strongly to transfers going to Newcastle or Scotland or wherever they may be needed because we are part of the same country. The problem you have with the euro area is not just this huge economic imbalance between north and south, but that increasingly the taxpayers of the north do not want to go on subsidising the south because there is no sense of European identity. We are very different countries. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I must congratulate you, Mr Samaras, for getting the Greek Presidency off to such a cracking start. I am sure your overnight successful negotiations in the trialogue on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) will have them dancing in the streets of Athens. No matter that your country, very poorly advised by Goldman Sachs, joined a currency which it was never suited to; no matter that 30 % are unemployed, that 60 % of young people are unemployed, that a neo-Nazi party is on the march, that there was a terrorist attack on the German embassy. No, do not worry about all that, because the trialogue on MiFID has been a success, and in many ways it sums up the two Europes: the Europe that is talked about in here by the dreamers, who want to impose a united states of Europe with an identity and currency, and the real world out there. And you come here, Mr Samaras, and tell us that you represent the sovereign will of the Greek people? Well, I am sorry, but you are not in charge of Greece, and I suggest you rename and rebrand your party. It is called New Democracy. I suggest you call it No Democracy, because Greece is now under foreign control. You cannot make any decisions, you have been bailed out and you have surrendered. Democracy: the thing your country invented in the first place, and you cannot admit that joining the euro was a mistake, because of course Mr Papandreou did that, didn’t he? He even said there should be a referendum in Greece – and within 48 hours the unholy trinity that now run this European Union had him removed and replaced by an ex-Goldman Sachs employee puppet. We are run now by big business, big banks and, in the shape of Mr Barroso, big bureaucrats, and that is what these European elections are really going to be all about. It is going to be a battle of national democracy versus EU state democracy. Whatever you may say in this Chamber, the people out there do not want a united states of Europe, they want a Europe of sovereign states trading and working together, and I believe the European elections are going to mark a watershed. Until now everybody has thought – much as they may not like the development of the European Union – that it was inevitable. That myth of inevitability will be shattered by the European elections this year. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, I know it is seasonal to talk about the 12 days of Christmas, but I want to talk about the 21-day count down to the opening of the doors to 29 million poor people from Romania and Bulgaria. It does, I think, mark a pivotal moment in British politics. Very often in Britain, MEPs complain that they do not have a high enough profile with the public. I want to try and change that today because Brigadier Geoffrey Van Orden sitting behind me here, British Conservative, was the rapporteur, the sponsor for Bulgaria joining the European Union and for us having a total open door to all of those people. So well done, Brigadier, I want all the British people to know who you are and what your achievements are and of course what free movement means – it means free health care; it means free education; it means free access to the benefit system; it means an open door to the criminal gangs and the modern day Fagins who will of course benefit from the fact that London is the most successful and wealthy international city in Europe. Already the situation is so bad that 92% of ATM crime in London last year was committed by Romanians. I am not scapegoating in any way and I know that a lot of people that come from Bulgaria and Romania will be very decent people who want to work hard and want to better their lives, but free movement does not work in the European Union now that we have countries that are poor. For a man that comes from Bucharest and works in London and gets child benefit for the two children back home: that child benefit is worth more than he can actually earn doing a menial job in Bucharest and that is the reason why the numbers that come to Britain will indeed be absolutely enormous. I have said for some time, and now the British people agree, enough is enough. 80% of the British people do not want those borders to come down in 21 days’ time. It is unfair. It is unfair on working people. It is leading to lower wages. It is leading to higher youth unemployment and it is leading to divided communities. But of course it does not end here, because our Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, with the full support of Labour and the Lib Dems, now wants to extend this principle of open borders, as he says himself, from the Atlantic to the Urals. So it means countries like Kazakhstan, indeed the Ukraine, joining the European Union. I see that Tony Blair is now helping Albania join the European Union. Well good luck to them with that. We even want to extend it to Turkey joining the European Union. Our message is that a turkey is just for Christmas; it is not for political union; we do not want open borders. And, Mr Cameron, do not, next week at the summit, surrender in any way to deeper European military integration. Many in this room would have bombed Syria had Europe had that capability. Thank God it did not. On open doors, on European armies, the voters will have their say next May, and I think there is going to be a radical change. I think there is going to be an earthquake in British politics next May. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr Brons, thank you for the question. Can I make something clear to you? UKIP is not against immigration. We welcome immigration. We want immigration; but we want an immigration system based, as the Australian one is, on saying we want people who have got skills to bring to our country. We do not want people who have got life-threatening diseases. We do not want people who have got criminal records – though of course in Australia, in the old days, that was a prerequisite – and we want to make our own decisions on who comes to Britain. We are not discriminatory, we are not scapegoating, we just want to control our own borders and live in our own democracy and we cannot do that as members of this European Union. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, there is only one real debate going on here this week in Strasbourg: it is the fear stalking the corridors, the concern you have got about the rise of euro-scepticism. Years ago you were less worried. The few of us here who were euro-sceptics were treated as being mentally ill and sort of patted on the head. Now we are evil populists; we are dangerous; we are going to bring down western civilisation. It is clear that you do not get it, you do not understand why this is happening. Well, let me help you. In 2005 it was the pivotal moment of this project: the French and the Dutch had said ‘No’ to the EU Constitution. Mr Barroso stood up and said: ‘They did not really vote ‘No’. They did not understand what they were doing’. But they did. You see, ever since 2005, the real European debate has been about identity. What we are saying – large numbers of us – from every single EU Member State is: ‘We do not want that flag. We do not want the anthem that you all stood so ramrod straight for yesterday. We do not want EU passports. We do not want political union’. If you think about it, there is nothing extreme about that position. There is nothing right-wing about that position; there is nothing left-wing, indeed, about that position. It is a normal, sensible assertion of identity. What we are saying on our side of the argument – you see, you can scream and shout all you like, which really rather proves to me why you are going to do so badly in the European elections next year, because you are not listening – we want to live and work and breathe in a Europe of nation-state democracy. We want to trade together, we want to cooperate together. We are happy to agree sensible common minimum standards and, yes, we want to control our own borders, which is the rational, logical and sensible thing for any nation state to do. We are not against immigration or immigrants. We believe there needs to be a degree of control, and that is the message that is picking up support right across this continent. I genuinely think that there is an opportunity for an electoral earthquake to happen in the European elections next year, with a large number of people from all sides of this House who will come with a nation state agenda, who will come saying: ‘Let us have a Europe, as de Gaulle might have said, of the patries
; let us not have a Europe of political union’. You can abuse us all you like, but what we stand for is fair, principled and democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, not one in a thousand British people would know who Commissioner Andor was. They would not be able to pick him out of a line-up and yet he is really rather powerful. He is the governor. He is the man who decides who can come to Britain and who can claim benefits. He has more power than a British Government Minister. But I have to thank him for his study, because he is the one who has told us that there are 600 000 economically-inactive Eastern Europeans in Britain – something our own government was not able to tell us. I suppose I have to admire his commitment to his job. After all he is going to take the UK Government to court to make sure that we do not treat Eastern Europeans any differently to our own people. So it is certain that he means business. I know that this is a very complex area, but let us just look at one in-work social benefit, shall we? Child benefit. From Eastern Europe, at the moment, there are people to whom we are now paying child benefit for 50 000 children who do not even live in the United Kingdom. There is no possible justification for us doing that. It is costing us GBP 1 million a week, and it is yet another pull factor. But of course, this whole issue is going to get bigger, because we appear to have learnt nothing from 2004. If you allow the unrestricted free flow of people between poor and rich countries, do not be surprised when you get a big result. We had a government prediction of 13 000 people a year, and it was something like 400 000 a year for the first two years. So we open the doors next year to Romania and Bulgaria. It means more oversupply in the unskilled labour market, a greater burden on the National Health Service and our schools and, yes – sadly – it is going to mean more crime too. This issue will be the central issue of the European elections next year. It will be the central issue of whether Britain remains a member of the European Union. We are not against anybody from Eastern Europe, but we do believe that it is right and proper that we should restrict and decide who comes to live in our country. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the problem is not just Mr Barroso but the entire unelected government of Europe – and perhaps there is a chance for our citizens to reflect on where the real power lies in this Union. I have listened to Mr Barroso for nearly 10 years and I give him full marks for consistency. He is a man who likes fixed ideology. He probably picked it up when he was a Communist or a Maoist, or whatever he was, and for the last 10 years he has pursued Euro-federalism combined with an increasing green obsession. And yes, it has been good! For bureaucrats, big businessmen and landowners it has not been a bad decade, but it has been a disaster for poor people, unemployed people and those on low wages. The euro, which you, Mr Barroso, believed would give us monetary stability, has done the very opposite. It was a misconstruction from the start and it is pretty clear that youth unemployment, at nearly 50% across the Mediterranean, is probably nearly double what it would have been, as a direct result of the misconstruction that is the euro. The countries in question are in the wrong currency, but I know that you will never admit to that. I think the euro will die a slow and painful death, but you are all in denial about that. However, it is the green agenda that I really find more interesting. You keep telling us, Mr Barroso, that climate change is an absolute top priority and you have been greeted with near-hysteria in this place over the last 10 years. Those of us who have been sceptical have been mocked, derided and called deniers. We argued from the start that the science was not settled, and we have argued very strongly that the measures we are taking to combat what may or not be a problem are damaging our citizens. We have been proved to be right. Tens of millions have been forced into fuel poverty; manufacturing industry is being driven away because our competitors in China and America are going for cheap fossil alternatives; and wind turbines are blighting the landscapes and seascapes of Europe. Yet still today you go on about green growth. Well, the consensus is breaking down behind you. Commissioner Tajani said the other day that we face a systematic industrial massacre. It is time to stop this stupidity. To help you, there is the NASA photograph taken last August of the northern ice caps and there is the NASA photograph of the ice caps taken this year. The ice has increased by 60% in one year. Leading American scientists are now saying that we are going into a period of between 15 and 30 years of global cooling. We may have made one of the biggest and most stupid collective mistakes in history by getting so worried about global warming. You can reverse this in the next seven or eight months. You can bring down people’s taxes. If you do not do so, they will vote on it in the European elections of next year.

 Oh no, I’m sorry, old son, I haven’t accused you of not working – far from that. I have accused you of doing far too much and actually, collectively in this House, forming a consensus, and I am going to come back to this green agenda. You all formed the view that carbon dioxide emissions were leading to rapid global warming and that it was the greatest crisis that has ever faced mankind, and therefore we had to start taxing carbon. There has been no global warming, Sir, for twenty years. The ice caps have grown significantly over the last twelve months, and I am making a positive proposal that would put back into work tens of thousands of people, and I am saying: let us scrap these climate levies and let us see where the science goes over the course of the next few years. I cannot think of a more positive thing that has been said in this House this morning. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, next year’s European election will not be contested on the old division lines of left and right and several group leaders have agreed with that today. Frankly, that is all irrelevant. It will be contested between those of us that believe in national democracy within the nation state and those that believe that the 28 countries that are part of the EU are better governed by these institutions. That in a sense is what this comes down to.  But, Mr Barroso, those of us that believe in national democracy do not want to take us back to the Western Front or 1914. Those of us that believe in national democracy will say to you it is a healthy assertion of identity, but it also shows a deeper understanding of why the problems of Europe were caused in the past. It is democratic nation states in Europe, that are stable, that will not go to war with each other, which are a force for good and I would remind people that, without the vote in the House of Commons two weeks ago, we would now be at war in Syria. What better proof can there be that nation state democracy can be a force for good? Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, I represent a group which is against military action in Syria. We are against it not because we are pacifists; we are against it not because we do not care about the awful things going on there. We are against it because we think there is some pretty poor thinking going on. The idea that somehow the rebels are the good guys and Assad’s regime are the bad guys really is an over-simplification of a situation in which we know that al-Qa’ida has significant representation amongst the rebel groups. Of course, we have seen it all before: an endless series of military adventures over the course of the last 10 to 15 years. One such, in Afghanistan, is still going on and is not achieving any of the original aims. I was worried when I heard the Americans telling us, to begin with, that it was about punishing Assad and then, within a week, that it was about regime change – a position which I know the noble Baroness herself supports. We think that firing a thousand cruise missiles is likely to make an unstable situation even worse than it is now. In a sense, Baroness Ashton, you are sitting pretty because, as the highest-paid female politician in the world, luckily you have a non-job because the EU, thank goodness, has not yet got a foreign policy and, as a result of that, what we saw two weeks ago in the UK House of Commons was a nation-state democracy standing up and saying something. As a direct result of that vote in the House of Commons, we have not gone to war in Syria: we have entered a period of negotiations and Assad has a chance to prove to all of us whether he is a good man or a bad man. I do not know how this will play out but at least, Mr Verhofstadt, there is a chance of peace, and I know that you represent the kind of political class who believe that global influence can be achieved only through bombing. Well, luckily – unlike extreme EU nationalists like yourself – British democracy has proved that nation-state parliaments can actually made people rethink. And, Mr President, I have to say, as somebody who has been here now for 14 years, it is ironic that the view which I used to represent was called extreme, but you can see who are the extreme militarists now.

The ‘good guys versus bad guys’ story is really something I take from your own Foreign Secretary and party member William Hague, who was urging the international community to arm the rebels – which struck me, given that we know of al-Qa’ida’s involvement, as total and utter madness. I will remain cynical and sceptical, like much of the European public, about who has used those weapons until we get the full report and we get the intelligence right. We went to war in Iraq being told that Saddam had weapons of … (Interjection to Mr Verhofstadt, who had been shouting objections: ‘Why don’t you shut up and listen for a change? You really must be the vilest, rudest man in European politics and you rant on and the Chair lets you get away with it because you are the former Prime Minister of Belgium. Well, there we are.’)
 So, Mr Tannock, I understand what you are saying. I understand that something ghastly has happened here, but before you take military action you need to be certain you are going to make things better and not worse.

 Sir, I would say this to you. I have never described the Romanians as living like pigs. What I said was that the Romanians treat their Roma minority like pigs. All right? So let us get that absolutely clear. You and your country discriminate against a large group of people in a way we have not seen in Europe since the 1930s. All right? Now, look. I am not taking sides in this civil war. But I am saying this: that whether it is through the use of gas, or whether it is through the use of other forms of high explosives or bullets, there are terrible things happening in Syria – I understand that and I agree – but rushing to war as we did in Afghanistan, as we did in Iraq, was a mistake and Mr Cameron tried to bounce us into war and, thank goodness, the House of Commons has given us pause for thought. Surely that must be a good thing. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, for the first time this year not just Mr Barroso but also President Van Rompuy have come to the Chamber, and yet look around you. What have we got? Five percent turnout amongst Members? They have not missed much. Just the usual drivel about the fight against youth unemployment.  With 62% youth unemployment in Greece, and with Spain not far behind, it is perhaps about time we were honest and admitted we are causing it ourselves. We are doing it through the misconstruction of the euro, through the obsession with global warming and the over-regulated business model. Yet your recipe is more bureaucracy: a youth guarantee scheme, another six billion for the youth employment initiative, the setting-up of the European alliance for apprenticeships, backed up by the quality framework for traineeships, and the list goes on, and on: yet more highly-paid civil servants setting up organisations that will achieve nothing.  Until the euro is broken up, until you reverse the social market model you will not help youth unemployment. However I must concede you have had one great victory. A couple of years ago Mr Barroso said that the European Union was an empire, and your empire has just expanded. Indeed David Cameron appears to be the biggest cheerleader for the EU extending all the way to the Urals. No, you have got Croatia. You have planted your flag on Croatian soil. Not that there was much public support for this: only 22% of Croatians turned out to vote in the European Parliament elections. But there was plenty of support from the Croatian political class.  Oh yes, the Prime Minister who negotiated entry, Mr Sanader, who was jailed for ten years last year for selling national assets, has been backed up by the whole of Croatia. They have sold out their country for personal gain and to be on a bigger stage. A country that fought for 800 years to be independent has given it away after twenty years to these guys in front of us today. Well you may be getting away with it for the moment, but it is not going to last very long. There is a gathering electoral storm. It is coming on the left, in the centre and on the right. You can hardly fail to notice what has happened in big countries like France or Italy, what is happening in Finland, the Netherlands, and even in Britain. The European elections next year present the opportunity for us to show you, Mr Barroso, that the European project is reversible, and it needs to be reversed for the betterment of the peoples of Europe.

 Well there was a referendum in theory. You will notice that less than 50% of people turned out to vote; you will notice that millions of euros from the European institutions were poured for many years into Croatia; and you will notice that there was something called pre-accession aid – we can call it bribery if you like – that was poured into Croatia, and there was a prize.  We, in turn, offered a prize for the first Eurosceptic article that appeared in a Croatian newspaper. In the three years leading up to the referendum we did not have to give away any money. That is the point: it is a one-sided political debate and it is all about the power of Brussels and the greed and vanity of politicians in Member States.  I am paid by the European Parliament and what I am doing – just as the Scottish National Party do, and just as the Irish Nationalists in the 19th century did – is using that money to expose the waste, the fraud and the extent to which our countries are now governed by these Chambers.

Mr President, well, there is a great degree of unity here this morning. A common enemy: rich people and successful companies evading tax, which is of course a problem – avoiding tax, which is not illegal but gives this whole Chamber this morning a high moral tone and, as Mr Barroso says, it is all about the perception of fairness. There is the added bonus, of course, that it drives a wedge between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans. But before we declare our virtues, perhaps we ought to look just a little bit closer to home, and I hope that the taxpayers all over Europe listen to this. If we look at the officials that work for the Commission and for Parliament, the highest category are people that earn a net take-home pay of just over GBP 100 000 a year and yet, under EU rules, they pay tax of 12%. It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, and I would say to Mr Barroso: how can that be deemed to be fair? How can people out there struggling – the 16 million unemployed in the eurozone – look at these institutions not only paying people vast sums of money but allowing them tax and, also of course, pension benefits on a scale not seen anywhere else in the world? So I suggest we have a bit less of this high moral tone. And what have these officials given us? Well they were the architects of the euro, which is a complete disaster. Their obsession with global warming, which chimes very strongly here, means we are despoiling our landscapes and seascapes with these disgusting wind turbines and driving up energy prices. But never let it be said that I cannot acknowledge success when I see it, and I am sure the citizens of Europe will all clap and cheer loudly that the grave mortal danger of olive oil in dipping bowls has been removed by the officials. Well done, everybody! (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

I agree with you that tax evasion is a problem and is costing governments money, but we should remember that tax avoidance is legal. The biggest reason that tax havens are allowed to prosper is that we have got this very statist mindset that we must try to get as much tax out of successful individuals as we possibly can. If you do that, and if you have a very complicated tax system, people will do all they can within the law to avoid paying tax. The answer for Western governments is to learn some of the lessons from the 1980s in Britain and America: bring taxes down, simplify taxes, and then those who wish to obey the law have no need to use tax havens.

Madam President, 25 years ago Mrs Thatcher recognised the truth behind the European project. She saw that it was about taking away democracy from nation states and handing that power to largely unaccountable people. Knowing as she did that the euro would not work, she saw that this was a very dangerous design. We in UKIP take that same view, and I have tried over the years in this Parliament to predict what the next moves would be as the euro disaster unfolded. But, even in my most pessimistic speeches, I would never have imagined, Mr Rehn, that you and those in the Troika would resort to the level of common criminals and steal money from people’s bank accounts in order to keep propped up this total failure that is the euro. You even tried to take money away from the small investors, in direct breach of the promise you made back in 2008.  The precedent has been set, and if we look at countries like Spain, where business bankruptcies are up 45 % year on year, we can see what your plan is to deal with the other bail-outs as they come. I must say, the message this sends out to investors is very loud and clear: get your money out of the eurozone before they come for you.  What you have done in Cyprus has actually sounded the death knell of the euro. Nobody in the international community will have confidence in leaving their money there. And how ironic to see the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, say of your actions: ‘I can only compare it to some of the decisions taken by Soviet authorities.’ And then we have a new German proposal that says that actually what we ought to do is confiscate some of the value of people’s properties in the Southern Mediterranean eurozone States. This European Union is the new communism: it is power without limits. It is creating a tide of human misery, and the sooner it is swept away the better.  And what of this place? What of the Parliament? This Parliament has the ability to hold the Commission to account. I have put down a motion of censure debate on the table. I wonder whether any of you have the courage to recognise it and to support it? I very much doubt that. I am minded that there is a new Mrs Thatcher in Europe, and he is called Frits Bolkestein. He has said of this Parliament – remember, he is a former Commissioner – that it is not representative of Dutch or European citizens any more, and is ‘living out a federal fantasy which is no longer sustainable’. How right he is! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the air is thick with denial in this Chamber this morning. There has been a major political event that has happened since we last met and no one has mentioned it: Italy had an election. 55 % of the electorate voted for euro-sceptic political parties. Indeed, Mr Grillo’s movement managed to get 26 %. It is quite tough in European politics these days to tell who the comedians are.  What is absolutely clear is that eurozone membership is completely incompatible with nation state democracy. You can do what you like to take away the powers of national parliaments but people will go on voting, and there is a trend developing right across Europe towards euro-sceptic parties getting and stronger.  There is complete denial about the eurozone crisis. You would think listening to everybody this morning that it is over. Mr Barroso comes out with a technocratic speech that everything is fine and dandy. Mind you, this was far better than the unutterable drivel we had from Olli Rehn yesterday, which sent many Members to sleep. But the EU is not facing up to the consequences of what it has done. Mr Verhofstadt talks about a lost generation in Spain; Mr Daul talks about youngsters struggling to be fed by their families in Greece. All of that is true, but it is being caused by the euro – and that is what the EU is failing to recognise.  The eurozone has been a complete economic disaster. But the real problem that the EU will not face up to though is the state of the French economy and the fact that France is now diverging by the month from Germany. So right at the very heart of the European project and the eurozone project there is a disaster coming down the track. I am afraid that, in the end, the whole thing is going to break up.  I would also point out that you are in denial over Romania and Bulgaria. Those countries are wracked with corruption and organised crime. They should never have been allowed to join the European Union and I want to make it absolutely clear: we in UKIP do not believe it is right and fair to have total open borders from next year for unlimited numbers of people from those countries to come to Britain to work but also, if they want, to claim benefits. As the results in the recent Eastleigh by-election showed, the British electorate are increasingly saying that enough is enough. It is not just us: the Mayor of Duisberg in Germany has now publicly said that the massive influx from Romania and Bulgaria is causing huge social problems. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to face up to it. We should not be in political union with Romania and Bulgaria. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Let me give you
 some figures. They are not ones that I really feel comfortable talking about as they are so shocking. There are 68 000 Romanians living in Britain. Over the course of the last five years in just one police area, the Metropolitan Police, there have been – believe it or not – 27 000 arrests of Romanians. Over 90 % of ATM fraud that takes place in London is now being committed by Romanian criminal gangs, and that is just the Met figures. We have not got the figures from across the rest of the country. Whilst with immigration you can get good people coming from other countries, you can also get bad people. The point I made in my speech is that I am afraid that Romania and Bulgaria are in the grip of organised crime. We do not want those people coming into our country. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, the highlight today of this debate was the Liberal leader, Mr Verhofstadt, comparing the seven-year EU economic plan with the Soviet Union’s five-year economic plan – and it was said without any sense of irony at all, which I thought was delicious.  Well, as the leaders meet tomorrow to discuss this budget, what a curious position David Cameron finds himself in. He made the big speech; he talked about a referendum in the future, and yet he has been criticised at home for making us wait for perhaps up to five years before we can have our say. Most people doubt his Eurosceptic sincerity, indeed he emphasised in that speech how pro-European Union he is, and yet here today he is met with a sort of venomous attack as if he is some terrible wrecker. I would have thought his chances of renegotiating very much look pretty limited, so I feel a bit sorry for him. He is like piggy in the middle, and you all remember from childhood what a frustrating and difficult place that is to be.  But he has made the speech, and we are going to have a proper debate in Britain about EU membership; but it is a debate that is changing. You see, the budget is not our top line issue. We pay in GBP 53 million a day. Whether that goes up to GBP 60 million or not, many of us are saying: why pay in a penny piece? Mr Barroso’s idea that a pound or a euro spent at European level is worth more than a pound or euro spent at national level – well, perhaps he has invented nuclear money, I have no idea. What perhaps we should recognise is that unemployment is actually being caused by Europe’s policies, in particular the mistaken euro project. The debate in Britain has changed and now it is about immigration. People in Britain are shocked at the change in every single city and market town since we opened the doors to eastern Europe in 2004. I have nothing against Bulgarians or Romanians, but it is unacceptable that we should open our doors to them unconditionally from 1 January next year. If Mr Cameron does not get a substantial renegotiation on the free movement of peoples then Britain will leave this Union. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, despite his own views, President Hollande is are doing rather a lot for the eurosceptic debate in France. President Hollande, the decision to reduce the retirement age, to increase the minimum wage and above all, of course, to introduce the ‘hate tax’ to make sure that all of your successful entrepreneurs – and now footballers – flee France, these all mean that the competitiveness gap between France and Germany is getting wider. That is now being reflected in a flight of capital from French banks. And people are beginning to notice that, ultimately, the euro is not just doomed in the Mediterranean, but it is going to be impossible for France and Germany to stay together inside the same economic and monetary union.  So, when your Employment Minister says the country is bankrupt, what do you do? The old trick of launching a foreign military intervention. Your troops go off to Mali; and yes, it is very good to see the smiling faces in Timbuktu for the moment, but you have done this on behalf of the European Union. It is now an EU mission. Just two days ago, Tony Blair said that the European Union is not about peace, but about power. I think what he meant is the European Union increasingly will be about war because the response to Mali, the response to it being an EU mission – and we have heard it all around the the Chamber today, the Liberals urging us to intervene militarily in Syria, support from right and left in this House – is that the EU should intervene militarily.  I have to say this: if you really think that taking on fundamentalist radical Islam in battle is something that we can somehow succeed in, I suspect we will launch ourselves in the same way we have in Afghanistan on a decade of unending, unwinnable misery. I do not want the United Kingdom to be part of a militaristic, warlike European Union, and that is the speech that I have heard both from you, President Hollande, and from most people in this Chamber today.

Mr President, we see there is nothing to worry about! Mr Barroso told us last week – I think I can say – that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome. Nothing to see here; move along – crisis over. Mr Draghi and Angela Merkel may well have committed the German taxpayer to unlimited sums of money in order to prop up the eurozone, and certainly ahead of the German elections there is perhaps not much else she could have done – and I do accept that the pressure from the markets, Mr Barroso, has eased for now. And from your perspective, Mr Barroso, and from everybody’s perspective I suppose, the champagne is still flowing, the chauffeur-driven cars are shiny, the salaries and of course the expenses are attractive, so everything is rosy in the EU garden. But I do not think we should be kidding anybody, Mr Barroso, because the fundamentals have not changed. In fact things deteriorated in 2012 – substantially. Unemployment has soared, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, with youth unemployment now up to 58% in two of those countries. Manufacturing, both in the north and south of the eurozone, is eroding with every single month that goes by, and there are the levels of human suffering that we are seeing – with pensions having been cut back, with soup kitchens growing all over the place, and with people in despair – and the prospects for 2013, particularly for the Mediterranean, are that it will be worse still.  And yet what the Commission and you, Mr Barroso, from your ivory tower, are saying is ‘let them eat cake’. You are showing that the European political class are out of touch, uncaring and simply plain wrong. But I am pleased to say that in Britain there is a proper European debate that is starting, driven I suspect by the rise of UKIP in the polls, and Mr Cameron, having postponed it for a few times, will speak this Friday on the issue. He wants to renegotiate the EU’s deal; he wants us to have an à la carte menu. Well, you may give him some concessions and you may not. His real plan is of course to deflect all of this so that there is not a referendum for five years. That or not, actually the longer this debate goes on, the more likely the UK is to leave the European Union. This debate will not stop and I am pleased to say that democracy, the arguments for democracy, are now staging a fight back and I look forward to when the United Kingdom does get that referendum. And I hope that many other countries will follow our lead, including Ireland, in claiming back their rights of democracy and self-government. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, there is a certain sense of irony here this morning because this is of course the week when you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, this great achievement. I thought the award bizarre, particularly as what we are discussing this morning is a new range of measures that will further pile on the agony for those southern euro zone states. Europe is now split from north to south, with increasing violence and enmity between the peoples of the north of Europe and the south of Europe, so I do not think the Peace Prize was really very appropriate. Not, of course, that that will pose you a problem tomorrow, because there are no leaders in those southern European countries who, frankly, have got the courage to stand up to the might of Brussels and challenge the euro zone project. However what you will have at tomorrow’s summit, yet again, is the curious case of Mr Cameron. On the one hand, he is a big ally. He resists having a referendum. He publicly states again and again that he wants Britain to remain a member of the European Union and, surprisingly, he has supported every one of your moves towards a fiscal union and banking union. Mr Verhofstadt indeed called Mr Cameron the greatest federalist outside the euro zone. Yet, on the other hand, he cannot go along with any of this because, politically, the financial transaction tax and the banking union are quite impossible in Britain. But every time there is a summit and the euro zone moves that little bit further forward, it leaves Britain — and Mr Cameron — even more marginalised. In fact it is barely worth him turning up tomorrow.  The great debate in Britain has always been that the single market has been the victory of our membership of the Union, and that we have great influence over that single market. Well, increasingly we are going to be excluded from the key decisions that affect that single market. Given the hostility – and I am sorry to disappoint my Conservative friends here, but there is hostility towards Britain in this place now, where people blame their economic problems on our City of London — frankly, the argument that the single market benefits Britain and that we have any influence over it is now disappearing, and very shortly I think you will be glad to see the back of us.

The story goes – Mr Cameron’s story and Mr Barroso’s story and the story of most people here – that the euro is something that needs to be saved. Therefore, the more money we throw at it, and the more guarantees we put behind, the better it is, because the break up of the euro zone would be a very difficult and perhaps perilous course to go down.  I am afraid that there is a problem with this. Nothing that is being done, whether it is the banking union or the fiscal union, does a single thing to change the problem that there is a massive gap in terms of competitiveness between the German economy and the Mediterranean economies. If we carry on down this route of saving the euro, we will probably finish up with violent revolution in those southern Mediterranean states. So I would say that it would be better, if we were good Europeans, to break up the euro zone and recognise that Greece, Spain and Portugal should never have joined in the first place. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, when I first starting standing up in this place and saying that I thought the euro project was flawed and would end very badly, I was met with a wall of derision in this House, and I must admit it was a very lonely old game. But now there is a growing number of people here who recognise the flaws in the euro project, and out in Europe roughly half the population of the EU and the euro zone now regret going into the currency.  But I was pleased to see this week that an even bigger voice is now being heard amongst the experts in the financial community. The Danish Bank – Saxo Bank – said that the euro zone leaders are behaving like drug addicts and alcoholics. And how right Saxo Bank are, because you keep on taking that same drug that is doing you and the peoples of Europe so much damage. It is time for some recognition. The Mediterranean states do not fit into the euro zone, and if this summit pushes on towards banking and fiscal union, it will not help anybody: it is going to break up in the end. Nigel Farage  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, it is received wisdom here that all the economic problems in the European Union, and in particular the shambles of the euro zone, are all caused by the Anglo-Saxon capital markets and therefore they must be attacked. That is what the financial transaction tax is really all about. And it says two things to me.  Firstly, this unilateral approach on financial transaction tax, on global warming policy, on all of these things, is rendering Europe the low-growth economic disaster zone of the world. This is a self-inflicted wound. These countries that are doing it are damaging their ability to do this business.  Secondly, even though the British Government sensibly are not going along with this, the very fact that this was proposed and that over two thirds of the tax would have been raised from the City of London, tells me we should not be in this club at all. It was put in place to damage financial markets and in particular to damage Britain. It is a bad idea for us and it is a bad idea for you too. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Prime Minister Cameron heads to Brussels tomorrow – I think, on ‘Mission Impossible’ – but it is a remarkable debate, in that the European Union is talking about taking another trillion euros from European taxpayers, despite the fact that the accounts have not been signed off for 18 years in a row. If this was a company, the directors, in this case the Commission, would all be in prison. But never mind; Mr Cameron will go and he will argue for a freeze, or what he means by a freeze, which is the same over-bloated budget with increases for inflation. And that actually is the very best that he can achieve in these negotiations. I have no doubt that, when he comes home, the UK taxpayer will have an even bigger bill. This will not work because the public mood in Britain is now very clear: what our taxpayers are saying is that enough is enough. No longer do we wish to pay money to Hungarian companies involved in projects that improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs. And our patience has completely snapped at such cultural absurdities as the EUR 400 000 given to the Flying Gorillas dance troupe who, using their own language of ‘rhythm, music and gibberish’ – they would fit in well here, would they not? – give performances such as the brilliant Smelly Foot dance, with an acoustic score that includes some ‘spectacular belching’. No, I am not making it up. I think the British public are angry at the fleets of chauffeur-driven cars, at the extravagant buildings and the never-ending travelling circus that is the European Parliament. We pay GBP 53 million a day to be a member of this organisation for no benefit whatsoever. Mr Cameron, when you come back from this Brussels summit, why do you not accept my challenge and let us have a proper full debate on Britain and whether it is worth staying a member of this Union or not. The last opinion polls over the weekend show that, by a majority of two to one, the British people now want us to leave this Union and not to pay you a penny piece.

– There is a parliamentary tradition of MPs entering assemblies but wishing to use their position in the interests of secession. We saw it with the Irish nationalists in the 19th century. Indeed, Sinn Fein run for elections to the UK Parliament, and the Scottish National Party sit in the UK Parliament. We came here because we felt that the British public were not being told what was happening in Europe and how much it was costing. We have used our position here to try to get that information back to the British public. Given that now, by a majority of two to one, the Brits want to leave this Union, I would say that we are doing a pretty good job. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, what we have seen this morning from the Commission and Parliament is a passionate defence of high salaries, index-linked pensions, chauffeur-driven cars and a lifestyle that none of you would actually enjoy out there in the real competitive world. It is the status quo: convincing itself that it you are doing a good job despite the fact that the public increasingly doubt you. I would remind you that every time taxpayers’ money is thrown at common European projects the results are less than a success. The common fisheries policy and its environmental degradation and now of course the euro are not just an economic but a social disaster which is engulfing the Mediterranean and it is all based on flawed thinking that the State if it has power and money can create wealth. The dead hand of bureaucracy is destroying innovation and destroying jobs in Europe. National democracy and free markets would be a much better model. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President: Mr Van Rompuy, when you first appeared here, in what proved to be a rather expensive speech I said you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy – and sure enough, in your dull and technocratic way, you have gone about your course. But I have to say you are even worse than I thought you were going to be. I thought it was just going to be a federal Europe – a federal Union – but actually it appears, with every statement you make, that what you now want is the total subjugation of states to completely undemocratic structures based in Brussels. I misread the bailouts. I thought that when the bailouts happened and I could see the panic around this Chamber, with people fearing economic meltdown... But you, of course, were calm through it all, because you saw the bailouts as your opportunity to take control. Just think how Ireland today has managed, and Greece, for that matter. The sinister-sounding troika come in, 50 officials spend a few days in the country, investigate the situation and then tell puppet prime ministers what they may or may not do. I note great enthusiasm in this Chamber for Spain to have a bailout: lots of Members here want Spain to accept the bailout, so that they too are subjugated to this new order. Indeed in Italy, the appointee there, Mr Monti, is very keen for his own country to be bailed out because, to quote him, he fears that parliamentary democracy could bring down the European Union. It is pretty clear that your next phase is for those that have not been bailed out and may not need to be bailed out. You now want them to sign budget guarantees and to have the power to strike down national budgets after they have been through parliaments. I have to say I feel that the eurozone is now in a very dark place economically, socially and politically, and I fear that the countries trapped inside it, in that prison, will be there for many years to come. So it is odd that, against this backdrop, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the European Union. It is true that Germany has not invaded France since 1945, but I do not think there is any prospect of that happening – unless what you are all saying is that the Germans are inherently bad people. No, the threat actually came from Russia, and we should be thanking NATO and millions of American soldiers who served on European soil to maintain peace. Yet I do not hear a word of that, because we loathe America and everything that it stands for. No, this is now a divided, split Europe, with neo-Nazi politics on the rise and violent demonstrations in the streets. Frankly, I think that the award of that Nobel Prize devalues that whole organisation. It is not all bad news, because in Britain the opinion polls are clear that a clear, settled majority of Brits now want to leave this Union, leaving David Cameron as piggy in the middle, trying to pretend to be a Eurosceptic when he comes over here, going back home and claiming victories – but he is stuck. I predict one thing: big political change is coming in Britain, because he is losing the support of millions of his own voters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 The EU has a vindictive, neocolonialist trade and aid policy towards the world’s poorest countries. It refuses to trade on fair terms with them, and has a desire to bully them economically. Much of the poverty and insecurity in the world’s poorest countries was created by the EU in the first place. Outside of the EU, the UK could pursue policies that genuinely help. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I begin today on a happy note remembering that it is 20 years ago this very week since the United Kingdom, having been signed up by the Conservative Government to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, broke out of the ERM. It was a great liberation for us and, of course, once having been bitten we did not join the euro project, thank goodness. Sadly, the same is not true for much of the rest of Europe. I thought, through the last 18 months or so, that the economic logic of why Britain left the ERM would apply, particularly to those Mediterranean countries, and I foresaw that actually those countries would leave the euro zone, probably with Greece leaving this year. But I now have to accept that I have been wrong about that, because I had totally underestimated the complete fanaticism of you, Mr Barroso, your college of Commissioners, and the European Central Bank. You have come out fighting on all fronts. Today you announced that there is going to be a banking union, yet more centralised control, yet more regulation. You make it clear that whilst you think the nation state should continue to exist, it must not have any democratic powers. All democracy is to be vested here under what you call the ‘Community method’ which of course means that your unelected Commission has the sole right to present that legislation, so I do not believe you when you say that and I find the tone of much of what has been said and done over the last few days really very worrying. Mario Draghi, now known by some that believe in the euro as Super Mario, showed us his big bazooka the other day. He upped the stakes and he told us – and to me it is an odd concept – that he had unlimited money. Now, I do not think money grows on trees and I think that money is limited to what the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayers are prepared to put in, but he has made clear his intention: he will fight to the last German taxpayer to keep the Mediterranean countries that should never have joined the euro in there. And now you have of course the Prime Minister of Italy – perhaps we ought to call him Monstrous Mario – who made it clear last week that he feared that nation state democracy could bring down the European Union and therefore we have to by-pass nation state democracy and pass all the powers here. Your henchman Olli Rehn, who is here today, dares to tell countries when they should and should not have general elections. He is urging Spain to accept a full bailout so that they too are trapped in the euro prison. I have to accept that you now have the whip hand over the citizens of Europe and I now think that this euro crisis will go on for a whole miserable decade. In the end, you will have to face the reality that even France and Germany cannot survive together in the same economic and monetary union and certainly with President Hollande reducing retirement ages, upping minimum wages and bringing in a hate tax for the successful, which will see all the entrepreneurs leave France, I am afraid that gap will get bigger. I wonder where the hope comes for those who believe in nation state democracy. We have heard that the German court this morning has decided that the ESM is OK. Maybe the Finns will say they have had enough. Maybe the Germans as a country will say they are no longer going to go on feeling ashamed and guilty for what their grandparents’ generation did and will start to stand up for their own economic interest. I do not know, but I suspect that the best hope we have actually comes from the United Kingdom, where the demand for a referendum is stronger than it has ever been, where our Conservative Prime Minister is in very deep trouble. I think today, Mr Barroso, the British people hearing you calling for the European Union to become a global power, making it absolutely clear that Member States must obey what you tell them, whether they are in the relatively wealthy north or the poorer south, I think those comments, this emerging, creeping, Euro-dictatorship is something that will repulse millions of British people. The only good news I take from today is that you have helped to bring that referendum just a little bit closer. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I think the point about listening is a very good one – a very good one. You should have listened when the French people voted ‘No’ to the European constitution, but you chose to ignore them. You should have listened when the Dutch by a massive majority of two to one said ‘No’ to the constitution, but you did not. You rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty without conceding a single power; you bulldozed it through, and here this morning we hear talk of a new treaty and a new constitution. When little Ireland not once but twice dared to vote ‘No’ in a referendum on European integration, you did not listen, you bullied them to make them vote again. You are the one, Sir, who is not listening. (Applause) Nigel Farage,

– 
Mr President, Mr Barroso claims to be a good democrat. It is a very twisted form of democracy when he says that all of those political parties that get votes with which you do not agree are not relevant. It is a pretty obscene definition of democracy to decry those of us that believe in national democracy and European cooperation. Mr Barroso calls us populists, extremists, xenophobic and nationalistic. Surely Mr Barroso, the point about democracy is that you engage in debate. You listen to what the other person has to say, you put it to the public and you accept the result. That is what real, genuine parliamentary democracy is about, and you seem to actually despise that and everything that those of us that stand for national democracy believe in. And to tell me that you are in this position because this Parliament voted for you! We were only given the chance to vote for one candidate! Is that your new model of European democracy? (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

blue-card answer.

 I think I had better be slightly careful how I answer the last part of that question. Mr Brok, the British Prime Minister is taken from the floor of the House of Commons and in fact nearly the entire British Government are elected Members of that House of Commons. That is the Government of the United Kingdom. The fundamental difference between that and the European Union is that this College of Commissioners that you see over here – the people who have the sole right to propose legislation with the European system – not one of them has been voted for by anybody in Europe and therefore they cannot be removed. That is why the European system is not just undemocratic, it is anti-democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, under the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament, if you, as the President, wish to enter into a debate, that is fine. You are allowed to do so but you first have to leave the Chair. I would suggest what you just did was to enter into that debate from the Chair, and that is not the way this, or any other Chamber, should be conducted. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, that is the 19th crisis summit that Mr Cameron has been to. As the Rolling Stones might say, the 19th nervous breakdown, and that is reflected I think by the funereal mood in this Chamber this morning. Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off. This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble. There is also a massive crisis of leadership. It is lovely to see you, Mr Van Rompuy. You have not been here for many months; it is delightful to have you back. Last time you were here, you told us we had turned the corner, that the worst of the crisis was over. With every one of your predictions, it goes on getting worse. I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America. You have made yourselves an international laughing stock. You do not have any credibility. But one piece of helpful advice from me: do not this summer go on any billionaires’ yachts on extended holidays, because the markets guarantee we will all be back here in August. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, another one bites the dust. Country No 4, Spain, gets bailed out, and we all of course know that it will not be the last. However, I wondered over the weekend whether perhaps I was missing something, because the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, said that this bailout shows what a success the eurozone has been. I thought, well, having listened to him over the previous couple of weeks telling us there would not be a bailout, I have the feeling, after all his twists and turns, that he is just about the most incompetent leader in the whole of Europe – and that is saying something because there is pretty stiff competition! Indeed, every single prediction of yours, Mr Barroso, has been wrong, and dear old Herman Van Rompuy, well, he has done a runner has he not? The last time he was here, he told us we had turned the corner and that the euro crisis was over; he has not bothered to come back and see us since. I remember being here 10 years ago and listening to the launch of the Lisbon Agenda. We were told that with the euro, by 2010, we would have full employment and, indeed, that Europe would be the competitive and dynamic powerhouse of the world. By any objective criteria, the euro has failed and, in fact, there is a looming impending disaster. This deal makes things worse, not better. EUR 100 billion is being put up for the Spanish banking system and 20% of that money has to come from Italy. Under the deal, the Italians have to lend to the Spanish banks at 3%, but to get that money they have to borrow on the markets at 7%. It is genius, is it not! It really is brilliant. So what we are doing with this package is actually driving countries like Italy towards needing to be bailed out themselves. In addition to that, we have put a further 10% on Spanish national debt and I will tell you – and any banking analyst will tell you – that EUR 100 billion will not solve the Spanish problem; it would need to be more like EUR 400 billion. With Greece teetering on the edge of euro withdrawal, the real elephant in the room is that once Greece leaves, the European Central Bank is bust. It is gone. It has EUR 444 billion worth of exposure to the bailed-out countries and to rectify that there will need to be a cash call on Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy! You could not make it up, could you? It is total and utter failure. This ship – the Euro Titanic – has now hit the iceberg and, sadly, there simply are not enough lifeboats. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we are in the midst of an economic and increasingly humanitarian crisis and yet Commission President Barroso is not here. Indeed, Herman Van Rompuy is not here either, not that it really matters because they are not prepared to listen to any debate or any argument. They are intent on pursuing their political dream of a United States of Europe and are prepared to commit economic suicide for an entire continent. And tomorrow night Mr Van Rompuy has called yet another summit at which he is going to present a strategy for growth and jobs. Elected MEPs, representatives of the people of Europe, from left and right, we have heard it all before. Remember the euro itself was supposed to create growth and jobs and yet it is actively destroying both of those things. The remedy we are being offered is more of the same. I would suggest that the medicine is killing the patient and to increase the dosage is madness. Do not listen to those who will tell you that the only alternative is for Greece to stay in the euro. Everyone is pushing this. David Cameron and all the other leaders are saying that we must keep Greece in the euro; if she leaves, the sky will fall in. It will not. There will be a few difficult weeks and then things will settle down. There will be a boom in tourism. Investment will start to come back into Greece. Innovation will start to come back into Greece as people start making products to beat expensive imports. Indeed, Greece outside the eurozone may well prove to be an inspiration for Spain, for Portugal and for many other countries. We need to recognise that a terrible mistake has been made. We must resolve to put it right. We have got to give people hope because out there now is absolute despair. We all remember Dimitris Christoulas, the 77-year-old former pharmacist who shot himself dead outside the Greek Parliament, but he is just one of a growing humanitarian disaster. There have been huge increases in suicides in Italy and in Greece, particularly by people running small businesses who cannot see a way out of the problem. Children are being left in increasing numbers outside the doors of churches because their parents cannot afford to feed them. Our leaders are too callous to listen and care. You can do something about this. You can rise up and say – and I know from my conversations with you that many of you agree with me – that I am right. We have got to break up the euro. We have got to restore democracy. We have got to restore human dignity. We must ignore Messrs Barroso and Van Rompuy. They have been proved to be wrong. We must provide people with hope.

– Mr President, I would say to Mr Papanikolaou that a reintroduced drachma would probably be 50 to 60% lower than its current value in the euro, something like that. Clearly, I am not advocating that we move to a new fixed peg; I am advocating floating currency rates because history shows us that every time we try to fix currency pegs, we get it wrong. The risk, of course, is that the cost of imports would rise, which is why I said that what it would also lead to is innovation in Greece, as people started to make products to undercut the price of foreign imports. But I tell you what it would give: it would give Greece a chance, because stuck inside the euro you are going to be literally destroyed. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, happy Schuman Day, or Europe Day as you now call it, although I thought the celebrations were rather muted. The only bit of real passion we had was Mr Schulz slagging off the English, but that now appears to be a sort of popular sport in this Parliament. When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I am not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore. I think we are celebrating the wrong day. We should not be celebrating 9 May; we should be celebrating 8 May: Victory in Europe Day. We should celebrate the last time the Germans tried to smash the continent and they foundered and at least half the continent got its democracy back. What we are celebrating on 9 May is another attempt, through different means, to smash democracy across Europe. I do not doubt for a minute that Jean Monnet was well intentioned at the start; he thought that if you abolish nation states, you would stop there ever being another war. He did not, at the time, of course, have the benefit of seeing that theory as it played out in Yugoslavia. But, like Communism, this has all gone badly wrong and the EU Titanic has now hit the iceberg. It is a European Union of economic failure, of mass unemployment, of low growth but, worst of all, it is an EU with the economic prism of the euro and this now poses huge dangers to the continent. We face the prospect of mass civil unrest, possibly even revolution, in some countries that are being driven into total and utter desperation. But there is perhaps an opportunity; there is perhaps some good news. Now a democratic rebellion has begun. It began in Finland last year with the True Finns getting nearly 20% of the vote and we are seeing in country after country new political movements on the Right and on the Left making big scores. But that may not be all good news because what we saw in Greece last Sunday was rather reminiscent of the German election of 1932. We saw the status quo Centre collapse and the extremes of Right and Left rise. You know, this project could even cause the rebirth of National Socialism in Europe. We are headed the wrong way. We must break up the eurozone; we must set those Mediterranean countries free; we must try to build a Europe. I want a Europe, but a Europe based on trade, a Europe based on cooperation, a Europe based on us sitting round the table and agreeing sensible rules on crime and the environment. We can do all of those things but we cannot do them if we are asked to rally behind that flag. I owe no allegiance to that flag and nor do most of the people in Europe either. (Applause from the EFD Group) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is a great shame Mr Van Rompuy is not here, because a month ago, he told us that the worst was over and we had reached the turning point; he even told us that he had solved the euro crisis. Today, we have a more realistic Mr Barroso, who says that if we follow his policies and stick together, we can solve this in the end. Sorry, no one believes you anymore, and actually, in the face of the rapidly deteriorating situation, these comments look ridiculous. In Spain, mass unemployment gathers by the day, and internal democracy in Spain is now under threat. In Italy – where we were told Mr Monti would sort it all out – growth figures are falling and the bond spreads are worsening. Now an IMF official has come out and said that it is obvious that at some point a euro break-up will happen. These are big changes: the euro is doomed, and with your policies, Sir – even if Greece accepts the austerity you are imposing on them, and even if, for the next eight years, they obey all this – in 2020, they will still have a debt GDP ratio of 120%, which makes one ask: what is the point? In Spain: if Spain was able to increase ... the difference is, Sir, Britain is not trapped inside the economic prison of the euro. Now take this: if Spain was to increase, if she increased her productivity growth by half a per cent a year (which at the moment looks unlikely), it would take her forty years to close the competitiveness gap with Germany. These countries were sucked in to a totally false economic boom with artificially low interest rates, and they are now paying the price. These policies cannot succeed. Mercifully, outside of this institution, economists the world over now say it is inevitable that the euro will break up; it is just a question of how. I really hope that the IMF now decides to stop pouring good money after bad into these bailouts, and I really do hope that not one penny piece more of British taxpayers’ money goes into propping something up that should be allowed to die.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, I see that Mr Van Rompuy is back for another two-and-a-half years, no doubt a reward for his great success. Indeed, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you, I thought perhaps I had got it all wrong. You talked about how positive the last Council meeting had been, that we have reached the turning point, that everything is going swimmingly, and I was beginning to believe it. And then I realised that you did not mention the D word: Default. No, that cannot be talked about. We pretend there has not been a default when we know, in fact, that in Greece last week, there was a very major credit event. Indeed, listening to all of you this morning reminds me of the great British comedy classic Carry On Up the Khyber
, where the colonial English go on having dinner, ignoring the fact that impending disaster is all around them. You are determined but delusional in this attempt to keep the euro propped up. And whilst you are enjoying your dinner, incoming shells are landing all around you: youth unemployment in Greece went through 50% last week. That is fine, carry on, serve the main course. And you will have seen yesterday that 110 German bondholders of Greek bonds are now going to take legal action against the banks and against the Greek Government. But do not worry chaps; carry on; everything is going to be fine. But perhaps the biggest bombshell is the German Finance Minister saying just yesterday that nobody can exclude a third bail-out. Pass the port. Do enjoy the party. It is a farcical situation, and why is it happening? That is what people in Europe want to know. Why is this happening? Is this being done to help Greece? No. It is going to crucify Greece. It is being done to prop up a failing project because you know that once Greece goes, others will go as well. And some of the language is telling. Mr Barroso, when leaders stand up and say that political moves are irreversible, history has one lesson: you are always, always, going to be proved to be wrong. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, the Commissioner picked the right man: puppet Papademos is in place and, as Athens caught fire on Sunday night, he rather took my breath away. He said: ‘violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country’. What democratic country? He is not even a democratically elected Prime Minister. He has been appointed by you guys. Greece is not run through democracy now, it is run through a Troika: three foreign officials who fly into Athens airport and tell the Greeks what they can and cannot do. The violence and destruction that you saw on Sunday is being caused directly because people are having their democratic rights taken from them; what else can they do? If I were a Greek citizen, I would have been out there joining those protests on Sunday; I would be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people. In the puppet’s efforts to get the MPs to vote for the bail-out package, he warned them that if they did not do so, there would be a dramatic decline in living standards. Has he looked outside the front door? Has he seen the fact that 50% of the young people are unemployed already? Has he seen the fact that the economy, far from stalling, has contracted for five years in a row, and is now accelerating on a downward debt spiral, a contraction of 7% per annum? Greece is being driven into the ground, and when it comes to chaos, you ain’t seen nothing yet. These policies are driving Greece towards a revolution. They need to be set free. If they do not get the drachma back, you will be responsible for something truly, truly horrible. (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP MEPs abstained on this resolution because, although we agree with some elements, we strongly disagree with others, in particular, the imposition of a financial transaction tax. Since the only option was a single vote on the report in its entirety, we could not support the GUE/NGL proposal. Nigel Farage,

– 
Mr President, first of all I would like to say: congratulations everybody! David Cameron had you worried for a bit, you even thought he was a Eurosceptic, but it is OK. You have had a quiet word with him and the real David Cameron is back. Whatever happened to the veto? No more vetoes any more. Indeed, Mr Cameron is now actively supporting this quite despicable pact, this plan to destroy and humiliate nation states that do not live up to a Germanic view of how economies ought to be run. I must say I thought the weekend’s proposals from the German finance ministry suggesting that a European Commissioner and his staff occupy a big building in Athens and take over the running of the country – a Gauleiter, some might say – must be joke. Even this EU, I thought, could not possibly sink to those depths – but of course it was just a negotiating position and what we now have for Greece is diplomacy at gunpoint. It is the kind of strategy that Palmerston used against Athens back in the 19th century. Nobody can deny today that Greece is no more than a colony. And this is all a terrible, huge mistake. Greece is not a failing subsidiary company where head office needs to come in and take control. Greece is a nation with a soul, a nation with pride, with history – goodness me, they invented democracy in the first place. They are suffering. They have youth unemployment of 50% caused, Mr Van Rompuy, because they are in the euro. You are causing the misery in these countries and you blather on about creating jobs and growth. None of this is actually going to happen. And remember, these people are being driven into humiliation and desperation. Desperate people do desperate things, and I am deeply fearful for what will happen in Greece if we continue with this mad course. And of course, as Mr Barroso knows, it is going to be Portugal next.

Blue-card answer to Reinhard Bütikofer. 
–
 Mr President, I did not use the word ‘Gauleiter’, I said ‘as some might say’, and indeed the biggest selling Sunday newspaper in Britain used that word. If you want to talk about hatred, just look at what this European project is doing. We have German newspapers slagging off the Italians for being cowards, slagging off the Greeks for being lazy and useless, and we have Italian and Greek newspapers depicting leading figures in Germany wearing Nazi uniforms. Surely the whole point is that this project that was designed to bring us all together in peace and harmony is actually ripping us apart and bringing back nationalisms. And if there was one country I really had a go at in my speech, it was actually the United Kingdom because I admitted the way we behaved towards Greece in the 19th century was not acceptable. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, there is a very bad case of denial in this Chamber this morning, a total refusal to accept that the euro project is failing. Greece is on the verge of a default. The bail-out fund is creaking. The credibility of the European Central Bank itself is now being called into question. It is all on the verge of going belly-up, and yet when the credit rating agencies tell the truth you try and pretend it is not happening. In fact Mr Brok and others were suggesting that it is all some dastardly plot by the Americans, the British and the Anglo Saxon markets to bring down the euro. The agencies are nothing more than the canary in the mine. They are telling you the truth, so please listen to Standard and Poor’s when they say that austerity alone will not work. You are driving these countries into depression just to save your euro project. But I must acknowledge that you have lost absolutely nothing when it comes to your powers of deception. No, that is still very much on course. It was Nick Clegg who gave us the clue – a man who, I suspect, is rather more popular here than he is back home these days. Clegg was asked whether there should be a referendum on the forthcoming treaty. He said there was no need for that because it was all going to be ‘folded into’ the existing treaties. I thought, ‘What the dickens is he talking about?’ Well, now I have learnt. Mr Cohn-Bendit made it clear: it is to be the ‘Community method’. It is to be legislation where you know you have a majority in this Parliament and you know, under qualified majority in the Council, you can get everything through. Why are you doing it this way? It is simple, is it not? – it is to avoid referendums. Because you know that if a treaty was put to Ireland and many other countries, the answer would be ‘no’. The peoples of Europe do not want this sado-monetarist package. The peoples of Europe, particularly in the case of the South, need to get out of the euro, to have devaluation and a chance to re-establish themselves again. You are denying them that chance and, by pushing the ‘Community method’, you are destroying democracy in Europe. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President – President Schulz – good morning to you. I know it is my job to congratulate you but, given that we knew this result two-and-a-half years ago, as a result of a stitch-up, there really does not seem to be much point. After all, nobody in modern-day Europe would ever have a big, powerful job that was decided upon by a full, open process. I am sure Mr Barroso would agree. I was musing this morning. I was thinking about what kind of President Schulz we were going to get. Are we going to get a dignified, calm figure who behaves like the Speaker of all great parliaments around the world, somebody who puts himself above politics and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day arguments and is an ambassador, indeed a statesman? Or are we going to get the Martin Schulz we have got to know since 2004 as leader of the Socialist Group? You know the one I mean: snarling, angry, unable to control his temper, intolerant of anybody with an alternative point of view, somebody who is contemptuous when, in free referendums, people have the temerity to vote ‘no’, somebody who is anti-British to his fingertips and does not like free markets? I was wondering which one we would get. Well, your opening speech has settled that question for me. It is pretty clear that we are going to have two-and-a-half years of political fanaticism from the Chair. I have to say that only a third-world country, only a banana republic, would want to have an overtly political President of a parliament, but that is what we have got. Mr Schulz, I may represent the smallest group in this Parliament, but I can tell you that it is a group whose ideas and whose views are now being echoed by a growing number of citizens right across this continent. I am sure you would agree that the opinion polls show that it is about 50-50 whether people think this EU is a good thing or a bad thing. What we represent is not anti-Europeanism. That is not what it is about. We believe in nation-state democracy. We want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of cooperation and we want a Europe that is responsible. We do not want a Europe that seeks to be a global superpower. We do not want a Europe run by Mr Barroso and the Commission, and the so-called Community method. I will do my very best to provide political opposition to your Presidency over the next two-and-a-half years and I hope you give us a fair hearing.

– UKIP supports democracy and human rights. However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers. We do however, feel the accusations of vote rigging in Russia are serious, and would like to see these allegations investigated by a third party. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have often asked myself the question: why would a successful country that has enjoyed a thousand years of independence give up its right of self-government to the unelected nonentities that we see sitting before us this morning? The answer that comes back from the Foreign Office and the great and the good is that we must have influence in Europe. We must have a seat at the top table and we can change things. We have done our best to prove what good Europeans we are. We go on paying you GBP 50 million a day. We have helped the euro bailout fund, even though we did not join the currency, thank goodness. We have given you 80% of the fish stocks that swim in our waters – your fleets can come and take that from us – and we have applied every directive you have given us absolutely to the letter, all of it to gain influence. In fact, Nick Clegg is so deluded he still thinks we can take the lead in Europe. When a British Prime Minister goes to a summit with a very modest proposal to protect a uniquely important British industry, a snarling President Sarkozy tells him where to go, with German approval of course, and we find ourselves without a friend in the room. Some influence! Well you have decided to head off on the Titanic towards economic and democratic disaster, and we are now in a lifeboat outside the Titanic, but we are threatened by a bow wave that is going to come and engulf us if we are not careful – and it is retribution. We have heard the language of retribution this morning. Financial markets legislation is going to be imposed upon Britain and we will have no influence whatsoever over any of it. Something changed though on Friday. Mr Cameron may not know it, but we are now on course: Britain is going to make the great escape. We are going to get out of this Union. We will be the first European country to get our freedom back. I suspect many others will follow, and then what we will have is our democracy back, our liberty back, and we will have influence in the world as you lot head for disaster. It is going to happen.

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, I have to say that that is a very difficult question to answer because there were half of dozen of them thrown in there. David Cameron did what he had to do; he was forced into an impossible position but, you are right, Mr Smyth: he has gained no concessions whatsoever and he has actually now left the United Kingdom even more vulnerable than it was before. We are in a permanent voting minority, we simply have not got a friend in the room, and we have heard this morning that they want to have our rebate, they want financial market legislation. However, he has opened a debate in Britain. The European debate has now started in earnest. Cameron does not know what he has unleashed. I think the momentum for us to have a referendum to divorce ourselves from these failing structures and to replace them with a genuine free trade agreement now has an unstoppable momentum, and that is good for the UK and it is good for Scotland. It will be good for your financial sector based in Edinburgh and will provide many, many jobs for Scottish people. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, I recently visited Croatia; I wanted to find out whether a proper national debate was going on, whether there was a fair campaign. What did I find? Well I found that the EU is doing everything it can to bribe the political class in Croatia. Doing it quite well too. Already the EU has given EUR 320 million to Croatia in what is called pre-accession aid; the EU has just spent a million euros on a blatant propaganda advertising campaign telling Croatia that the EU is their only hope. Cleverly, you have even given jobs to Croatians – highly paid jobs to Croatians in the European Parliament and in the European Commission – just to show them how well off they – the ruling class – will be if they join. And you have got EU flags flying on official buildings all over the country, to give the impression that it is a done deal. You have some willing helpers because the old Communists are still there in Croatia. They still hold all the positions of power and they will all become personally enormously wealthy if Croatia joins the European Union. There is an even more sinister side to this because there is not a free press in Croatia. There is no national debate going on at all. Indeed a prize has been offered – HRK 10 000 – if anybody can find an article in any Croatian newspaper suggesting that joining is not the right thing to do. The whole campaign is bent, corrupt and distorted. We have seen this before from the European Union, but I think it is happening on a scale in Croatia that is worse than I have seen before. This country has for nearly a thousand years sought independence and for 20 years they have had independence. They got out of the failed political experiment that was Yugoslavia. If they vote to join the European Union, they are voting to rejoin a new Yugoslavia, a failing political experiment that will implode. I hope there is, in the last month or two, a debate in Croatia. Sadly, I doubt it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, here we are, on the edge of a financial and social disaster, and in the room today we have the four men who were supposed to be responsible. Yet we have listened to the dullest, most technocratic speeches I have ever heard. You are all in denial. By any objective measure, the euro is a failure. Who is actually responsible? Who is in charge out of you lot? Well of course the answer is none of you, because none of you have been elected. None of you actually have any democratic legitimacy for the roles that you currently hold within this crisis. Into this vacuum, albeit reluctantly, has stepped Angela Merkel. We are now living in a German-dominated Europe – something that the European project was actually supposed to stop, and something that those that went before us actually paid a heavy price in blood to prevent. I do not want to live in a German-dominated Europe and nor do the citizens of Europe, but you guys have played a role. When Mr Papandreou got up and used the word ‘referendum’, you, Mr Rehn, described it as ‘a breach of confidence’, and your friends here got together like a pack of hyenas, rounded on Papandreou, and had him removed and replaced by a puppet government. What an absolutely disgusting spectacle that was. And not satisfied with that, you decided that Berlusconi had to go, so he was removed and replaced by Mr Monti – a former European Commissioner, a fellow architect of this euro disaster, and a man who was not even a member of the Parliament. It is getting like an Agatha Christie novel where we are trying to work out who is going to be the next person who is going to be bumped off. The difference is that we know who the villains are. You should all be held accountable for what you have done. You should all be fired. I have to say, Mr Van Rompuy, that 18 months ago when we first met, I was wrong about you. I said that you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy, but you are not any more. You are rather noisy about it, are you not? You, an unelected man, went to Italy and said that this is not the time for elections but the time for actions. What, in God’s name, gives you the right to say that to the Italian people?

– This is not a matter that should be within the power of the EU, but within that of sovereign nation states, working under international agreements. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, I am always prepared to accept that I might be wrong and I thought the democratic revolution against this euro lunacy was confined to Northern Europe, but now we see that Slovakia has joined it and I must say what a wonderful result that was last night in Slovakia. I am sure many of you here will agree. It has produced, I think, the quote of the crisis. Richard Sulik, who led the rebels said: ‘I would rather be a pariah in Brussels than have to feel ashamed before my children who would be deeper in debt’. Well I know how he feels because I have been somewhat of a pariah here perhaps for the last 10 years, but he has got it right because he summed up the detachment between Brussels and the real people of the European Union. Listening to this debate today, it is almost as if this debate has been going on inside a padded cell that is the European Parliament, as people compete for who can be the most stupid; who can waste the maximum amount of taxpayers’ money. I really do think as a political class you are all wrong, and you are all wrong democratically because nobody has ever given consent for this behaviour. When people vote ‘no’; when the French vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Dutch vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Irish vote ‘no’, you say vote again and get it right. When Slovakia votes ‘no’, we are told today it will all be OK because they can vote again this week until they get the right answer. We have 17 countries trapped inside this economic prison of the eurozone and all you can do, Mr Barroso, is stand up and say: we need more power. People like you – who have been the architect of this failure, the architect of the misery that is being inflicted upon millions – want more power. It is like Barroso in the bunker, unaware of what is happening in the outside world, but planning world domination. In economic terms, it is getting madder and madder. I hear that the new idea is that the bail-out fund will be multiplied, geared up times five, by the European Central Bank so that you have got your two trillion, Mr Verhofstadt. Two trillion – good God! Greece is going bankrupt. If you lot continue, the whole banking system in Europe is going to go bankrupt. The former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, this morning described the attempts to save the euro as the most gigantic Ponzi scheme. I am tempted to think he is right. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, Mr Barroso told us this morning that the European Union is an inspiration. Mr Barroso, whilst you admitted to there being one or two little economic problems, you made it perfectly clear that jobs and growth were to follow, that everything is going well. In fact you painted a vision that a new period of European renewal is upon us. As a former Communist yourself you probably remember the old Soviet leaders getting up to give their speeches and telling everybody that there was a record harvest or that tractor production figures were terribly good, and they of course believed that history was on their side. In fact President Khrushchev got up and said to the West: we will bury you. So much did he believe in his own Union. Now of course we look back at that and we laugh. I think that in our tomorrows people will look back at you and they will say: how on earth did this unelected man get all of this power and how did Europe’s political class sitting in this room decide that the Community method should replace national democracy? I think people will look back in astonishment that we have surrendered democracy. But what you want to do is to say, right, we have a European Union and what we have to do now is have more of it. So, as an architect – and you are one of the key architects of the current failure – you say that even though everything to date has been wrong we are going to do more of the same. I thought that was a definition of madness. I cannot believe that this is a rational response to any situation in which you find yourself and, far from it being a State of the Union, I would argue that the Union is in a state because just look at the confusion. We have got you as President of the European Commission, we have a President of the European Parliament; we have got my old friend Herman van Rompuy who is the permanent President of the European Council; we have got the Poles, they are now presidents temporarily of the European Council; we have got presidents all round this room. Goodness me, even I am a President. I am not sure what the collective noun for presidents is, perhaps an incompetence. I do not know. But certainly when you take away democratic accountability it is clear that nobody really is in charge and it is developing as a Union of intolerance. Anybody who stands up here and dares to give a political view which is different from the received wisdom is written off as mad, insane, violent and fascist; we have heard it for years from these people. The intolerance is so deep that, when we get referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland that reject your view, you as a political class see it as a problem to be overcome. So I am very worried about the whole root of this Union. There is a new nationalism that is sweeping Europe. You want to abolish the nation states, in your case, Mr Schulz, perhaps because you are ashamed of your past. And you now want this flag and a new anthem to replace nation states and you do not care how you get there. If you have to crush national democracy, if you have to oppose popular referendums, you just sweep this aside and say that it is populism. But it is not, it is democracy. What is sweeping northern Europe now, starting off in April with that amazing result in the Finnish general election, is a new democratic revolution. It is not anti-European. It wants a Europe of trade; it wants a Europe of cooperation; it wants a Europe where we can do student exchanges and we can work in each others’ capital cities; it wants those things. But it does not want this European Union model. Frankly, you are all now yesterday’s men. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, this point is often made, namely that a country like Britain is only 62 million people and are we not better off being part of a big European club so that we can have more of a voice on the world stage? Funny that, is it not? Here is Britain, the world’s fifth largest trading nation, which is now prohibited from going into World Trade Organisation talks because all of that is done, on our behalf, by an unelected European Commissioner. Mr Duff, the answer actually is that an independent Britain that trades and cooperates with her European neighbours in an age of globalisation would be able to forge her own trade relationships across the world. It would make sense for a country like ours to start off with the English-speaking world, which shares common law – our own kith and kin in the Commonwealth who we turned our backs on so shamefully. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, your detachment from reality is almost unbelievable. You are behaving like a political ostrich, pretending none of it is happening. You just told us a few moments ago that Greece fundamentally has no problems because it is a member of the eurozone. I mean, that is just deluded. You wrote recently that the euro’s 13-year history is a success story. Well, it is a very odd kind of success, is it not, and actually saying that frankly beggars belief and I think hardly makes you credible. I think it is about time that you and others in this room woke up to the fact that we are inflicting misery on millions of people through unemployment, through poverty, through a loss of democracy, and that it is an error to try and keep countries trapped inside the euro prison. The recent proposal is that Greece should write down her debts by 50% and remain a member of the eurozone. Surely, Mr Juncker, if that happens, the same would happen to Portugal and Ireland too. Do you think it is possible for any Member State of the euro to write down their debts and stay a member of the eurozone? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Very good, Mr Juncker, very good. Interesting. On this very point of credibility, you yourself said back in April that, when things become serious, you have to lie. That is what you said back in April. It seems to me that things are pretty serious and that, frankly, everything you say is a lie. The euro cannot, and should not, be held together under its current construction. It is about time that you admitted – you and all of you in this room – that you have got this wrong and countries like Greece need to be set free. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, there is a new mood in Strasbourg today, and during your speech, Mr Barroso, there was an all pervading sense of gloom. I saw for the first time even your own supporters shaking their heads. They do not believe in what you are saying. The European people do not believe in what you are saying, and I do not really think even you now believe in what you are saying. Because we all know that Greece is going to default. The end game for Greece is near. And you cannot say you were not warned. You were told the Treaties were fatally flawed. You were all told that Greece should never have joined the euro. And when I stood up here five years ago and talked about Greek bond spreads you treated me with such utter derision, it was as if I had been led out of the local lunatic asylum. No, you have been warned all the way through. So now what you have got is economic governance, and everybody here in this front row supports more European economic governance. What is European economic governance? I will tell you what it is: it is a plane landing in Athens airport out of which get an official from the Commission, an official from the European Central Bank and an official from the appalling IMF, and those three people – the troika you call them – go in, they meet the Greek Government and they tell the Greek Government what they may or may not do. You have killed democracy in Greece. You have three part-time overseas dictators that now tell the Greek people what they can and cannot do. It is totally unacceptable. Is it any wonder that Greek people are now burning EU flags and drawing swastikas across them? Frankly, unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and political prison you may well spark a revolution in that country. I suppose there is some good news at least, and that is that in Germany people are waking up; right up to the President people are saying all of this represents the death of democracy. None of this can work, and the German people will simply refuse in the end to pay the bill. Your one achievement is that you have split Europe between north and south. The Greeks now badmouth the Germans; the Germans badmouth the Greeks. I have one last plea, Mr Barroso: will you please help Greece? Help it to get its currency back. Help it to reschedule its debts. Help it out of the mess that you have put it into. Your policies have failed. Stand up, be a man, admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the Member is quite right. London has had some huge social problems, but they are not there today. The difference is that in Greece these protests go on day after day. I put it to you that if you rob people of the most powerful thing they possess in a free society, their ability to vote for and to fire their governments and their ability to be the masters of their own destiny, all they are left with is civil disobedience and violence. So what you are doing in the name of economic governance is something which is incredibly dangerous. Far from this European project being something that will engender peace, it is likely to do the very opposite. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in replying to Mr Tusk, having listened to his words this morning, I have to ask him this. In an age when the gap between ordinary voters and the European political class grows wider by the day, just what planet are you on? Why the pretence that everything is going incredibly well? The EU is mired in deep structural crisis. Greece, Portugal and Ireland cannot survive inside the euro. The Danes have torn up the Schengen agreement, and good for them, because the total free movement of peoples is a completely irresponsible thing to have done. Public opinion is saying that, whilst they want a European cooperation – yes, of course I agree with that – what they do not want is this Europe, run by unelected bureaucrats like Mr Barroso. You say the EU is fantastic in a recent comment. You are supporting the destruction of national democracy. But it is with reference to Greece that I am most concerned about you because, when faced with their recent enslavement, you said: ‘we lived for many years as a non-sovereign country, under Soviet occupation. For us, European integration is not a threat to sovereignty because we experienced not long ago a serious threat to our sovereignty’. So what are you saying? That this is not quite as bad as the USSR? Is that really good enough for your people? And today you describe Greece’s problems as trivial. I am sorry; there are hundreds of thousands of people out there on the streets of Greece fighting to get their democracy back. It beggars belief that you and our President, Mr Buzek, can talk about the Solidarity movement, about Poland getting its democracy back 20 years ago. Yet here you are, surrendering the democracy and sovereignty of Poland to a failed European Union. Yes, sir. We all want a shared European cooperation for the future, but this most definitely is not the model. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Mr Goebbels, post-1945, there were some very sensible ideas put together, namely, the Council of Europe. Let us have a Europe where we sit down together, where we have a free trade agreement and where we agree minimum standards on work and on the environment. We can do all of these things without a European Commission, without a European Parliament and without a European Court of Justice. We have done it in security terms with NATO. Yes, it will mean you will lose your job, Mr Barroso. But, apart from that, why can we not do things as mature democracies? Yes, Mr Schulz, I want you sacked as well – I want you all fired! We can do these things, and that is a positive way forward. By taking away from people their ability to govern themselves and transferring that power to the European Commission, we are headed for a Europe of rebellion and violence. Let us take the democratic route. (Mixed reactions) Nigel Farage  (EFD

We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 – which prevents us labelling our own products as, for example, ‘Welsh beef’ and ‘Cheddar cheese’, without EU permission. 2. Further, it also gives the Commission unspecified powers to apply delegated acts in the future, thus changing the legislation in a manner which they choose, without reference to the EP members or any voting process in the EP. 3.

We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, which even removes our power to freely designate a product as ‘English’ or ‘Welsh’ or ‘Scottish’: Article 2, section b: “ ‘geographical indication’ means the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country ...”.

 Mr Orbán, you are one of the few European leaders who has a grasp of history, believes in the nation state and champions democracy. I would say Hungary is lucky to have you. You have shown you are not prepared to be bullied by these EU nationalists. When you say that previously Hungary was dictated to by Moscow, and now it is Brussels, and you say that you are going to stand up to it, you actually mean it. So I think you have proved to be the secret weapon of the Eurosceptic movement. Your six-month tenure in this presidency has indeed been historic, because in the last six months the peoples of Europe have finally woken up to what a completely undemocratic and failing project this is. There have been some real highlights in your six months. In particular, one thinks back to the Finnish general election and the stunning success of the True Finns party. Who can blame ordinary taxpaying voters, in Finland or elsewhere, for saying that they do not want to go on bailing out this failed project called the euro? Well, hard on the heels of the Finnish result we had the third catastrophe, the third casualty; Mr Barroso’s own Portugal needed to be bailed out. Then of course we were back to Greece for the second bail-out, with people out rioting on the streets. But perhaps to cap it all, the real highlight of your presidency was that the Danes tore up the Schengen Agreement. So, all in all, I would say that you have had a remarkable, superb six months in office. More has happened to reawaken democracy and the future of the nation state perhaps than ever before. I think there is a growing realisation, both here and elsewhere, that the worm has turned, and we have seen the beginning of the end of this extremely dangerous project. Mr Orbán, jolly well done!

 I voted against the Balzani report on the mandate for the trilogue negotiations from the Budget committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for 2012 by 3.7% for commitments and 4.9% for payments. I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2011 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations.

 These two amendments (10 and 11) were supported to stop a cap or ceiling being introduced for direct payments. The effect of such a cap would be to create an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare as landowners sought to divide up large holdings to avoid the ceiling cutting their money: it represents the very worst sort of bureaucratic perverse incentive for questionable but probably legal behaviour.

 Mr President, every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is, he says there is no need for one. Mr Barroso, every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say, ‘no no, there is no problem’. Here we are, on the verge of the second Greek bail-out, and you say, ‘there is no alternative’. We must continue down this route. We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next. What a fine mess you have got us into. You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won’t. It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out, which we will be discussing in a just a few months’ time. I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package. They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression. They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy. They are on the streets and there is violence, and frankly this can only get worse. You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy. What good Europeans, really good Europeans, would do, is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency, to allow them to devalue, to let them renegotiate their debts, because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return. Then, and only then, can real austerity packages work. Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts. If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, the United Kingdom went through this exactly twenty years ago. We were part of the exchange rate mechanism. We were trapped, trying to peg ourselves against the Deutschmark with interest rates that were double what they should have been. It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily. Mercifully we crashed out of exchange rate mechanism, interest rates came down and we had a happy time during the 1990s. You cannot fuse together different economies with different rates of growth and with different patterns of trade across the world. We learned our lesson. We did not join the euro, thank God. Those who did are, I am afraid, currently trapped inside an economic prison. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro. Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out, you have come back and said, oh no, they don’t, everything is fine. And now we face the fourth bail-out – the second Greek bail-out – unless, of course, today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either. But the question I want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in Greece or Ireland or Portugal to date. It is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks, and which concerns the integrity of the European Central Bank itself. Month after month, I have warned that you cannot go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt. Mr Barroso, do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Backing up some of my rhetoric, just yesterday, the respected think-tank, Open Europe, came out with some figures on this. It said that a staggering EUR 190 billion of the ECB’s exposure is exposure to the Greek state and Greek banks. Should the ECB see the value of its assets fall by just 4.25%, its entire capital base will be wiped out. Do you accept the findings of Open Europe, or do you go along with Mr Juncker’s assertion a couple of weeks ago that, with the situation in the euro being as serious as it is, you actually have to lie in public? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to say to Commissioner Rehn that I have been looking at the IMF Charter. There is nothing here that will surprise you; it is there to promote balance, growth, exchange rate stability, to lessen disequilibrium and to help countries that are in trouble. The classic method uses is to shore up the finances and organise a competitive devaluation. Nowhere in here does it say that the IMF is there to support political experiments and, in so many ways, that is what Dominique Strauss-Kahn did. He used the IMF to help bail out the failing euro project and, as such, he was a very poor choice of candidate. Now you want to compound that by approving Christine Lagarde – another member of the European political elite, another euro fanatic, somebody else who believes in propping up this euro project – and I would have thought that, as she has got a vested interest, she is, in fact, a highly unsuitable candidate. It is as if the EU has hijacked the IMF, that it is now there as part of the support mechanism for the euro, so that it is not just the taxpayers of the eurozone and the non-eurozone EU members, but the whole world that now has to help prop up the euro as the Greek problem compounds by the day. Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question. I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well. I would have thought this is a very poor choice. The international community at some point will tell you where to get off – perhaps not just quite yet. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, yesterday indeed was Europe Day and in the courtyard here we had armed soldiers, we had the Luftwaffe band and imperial eagles, we had the flag being paraded, being raised, the European anthem; it was the display of militarism and EU nationalism. I thought and hoped it was all just a bad dream, but today we have got you, Mr Barroso. You begin of course by reiterating the fact that the free movement of peoples is the embodiment of the European project. You then go on to say that it is the duty of Member States to share the burdens of migratory flows into Europe. You advocate a common EU immigration policy, but of course you know that you are losing because the row that has blown up between Italy and France shows that when there is a crisis, between the theory of European integration and the practicality of nation state, it is the nation state that wins. So you are worried that you are losing and, in your defence of your position, in your defence of your beloved acquis communautaire, your body of law, you resort to intolerance, you resort to nationalism, you make me realise that what I saw yesterday was actually for real. You attack those who want to control their own border policies. You attack them today as xenophobes. You attack them as extremists, but worst of all, oh worst of all, you attack them three times for being populists. Is that not a dreadful thing? The power of the ballot box. When people dare to vote no in referendums, they are populists; when they want to control their own borders, they are populists. I put it to you that populists are actually democrats and you abuse those who want to fly the flag of populism. Well, here it is, Mr Barroso. Here it is. (Mr Farage, Mr Agnew and Mr Bloom held up small Union Jacks)
 That flag has represented liberal democracy far more than any other Member State of this European Union and it will go on long after your star-spangled banner has disappeared. Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, under Rule 110 of our Rules of Procedure, the Commission may, at any time, request permission to make a statement on an urgent issue. Overnight, we have had the economically calamitous, but unsurprising, news that another country has bitten the dust and that Portugal is going to have to be bailed out. Can I ask whether you have received any request from the Commission to make a statement on Portugal today? If not, would the Commissioner say why not? Does he think that the bailing-out of Portugal is not important enough for this Parliament to discuss, or is he just burying his head in the sand? Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others. Therefore, UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments, but voted a resounding ‘No’ to the report as a whole. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr Barroso, I am confused. Help me. What is the EU’s policy on Libya? I got a letter on 1 April from the noble Baroness Ashton telling me that the EU had provided more than EUR 75 million in humanitarian assistance and that, although the situation remains uncertain, the EU has offered to assist in fostering dialogue. Yet she wrote this many days after the bombing had begun. That is what she has been saying. On the other hand, we have got hard man Herman Van Rompuy, who has made it clear that regime change is the aim of this Libyan adventure. He also said that the action in Libya could not have happened without the European Union, and that France and Germany could not have taken military action without first getting the support of the European Council. So we have two big chiefs within the European Union directly contradicting each other. Could you please shed some light on the matter, and tell us what is the European Union’s policy on Gaddafi and Libya? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Well there is certainly a broad range of opinions here. I wonder whether Mr Barroso would agree with me that appointing as Head of your new Foreign Office and in charge of external security a woman who has been an extreme left-wing, life-long passivist, the former treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, somebody who has proved to be incompetent in the job, was not in fact one of the better decisions of the European Union. I can only say thank God for Baroness Ashton, without her I suspect all of us would be very much deeper into Libya. Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report threatens with the prejudice a reduction of the budget would have on European solidarity and economic development. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso’s view of the world today, but it was perhaps rather more ironic than he had intended. He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere, saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy. I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then, if you do not like what they do, you can get rid of them, turf them out and put somebody else in. It was ironic because his next sentence was ‘and that is why in Europe, facing the euro crisis, we must reinforce the Community method’. For the public watching in on this – which increasingly they do – the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats – people like you, Mr Barroso. I know the European Parliament voted for you, but you were the only candidate that was offered to us. That is not democracy! So Mr Barroso is saying, on the one hand, that democracy is good, but on the other hand, that we cannot have it in Europe. That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt, who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished – well, perhaps his own will be very shortly. He is saying that we want an economic union. Nobody has voted for that. Nobody has been asked whether they want it. He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it. What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal. After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland, it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message – ‘Come in number 3, your time is up’. Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6% on Monday. Mr Barroso knows that himself. It was when yields reached 7% that Ireland had to be bailed out. In April, we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt – another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over. Let us remind ourselves that, in the last six months, 80% of Portugal’s debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank. We cannot go on as a European Union buying our own debt. If we do, the next debt crisis will not be in a country, but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, I am pleased that Mr Schulz has asked me that. The difficulty is that when you form an artificial state that has within it more than one language group – which is clearly the case in Belgium – you may, for a period of time, be able to hold it together, but whether it is Belgium, whether it is Yugoslavia or whether it is the European Union, if you have entirely different languages and cultures, it will not hold together. The reason you are so upset about Belgium, and Mr Van Rompuy got terribly upset about it and Mr Verhofstadt never likes it, is that – is this not the truth, Mr Schulz? – Belgium is a microcosm for the whole European project. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, that is a good question. Mr Schulz, you are quite right that Belgium was a British invention, and a British mistake. We have made many over the years. We have got some things right and some things wrong, just as your country, Germany, has. Germany’s history has not been whiter than white, I think you might agree. You are quite right. Actually, holding together the United Kingdom has been something that has been deeply troubling. Indeed, Ireland went its own way, back in 1921, I think, when independence for Ireland was established. You are right. It is very difficult to hold together different cultures. I do think that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland works, at the moment, because it has consent. If it did not have consent, then there would be popular calls for referenda and those nations would be able to break away. But my point is that in this European Union, nobody is being given that opportunity. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the theory of a Tobin tax has been around for years – the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange – but, of course, it has never seen the light of day. What is being proposed here – and, of course, it is because the European Union is so desperate for money and is in so much trouble that it needs its own resources – is to use an opportunity to bash the financial sector because they are very unpopular at the moment and to introduce a financial transaction tax just in the European Union, as if somehow that will gain us great revenue. I am sorry, but we are living in a global economy. If we become uncompetitive through tax or regulation, people simply move – and they can do so in the space of 24 hours. To do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics. The biggest foreign exchange market in the world – the biggest financial sector in the world – is in London. If I did not know better, I would think perhaps there was a plot afoot here to stop the Anglo-Saxons going on doing all of their business. In 2010, as a result of the AIFM Directive, one in four hedge funds left the City of London. If we continue down this route, Britain will have lost its biggest single industry. I think the time has come when the City of London and Britain’s financial markets are going to rise up against membership of this European Union. Maybe, if we vote for this tomorrow, it will be so bad that it will be really rather a good thing for UKIP and our view that we should not be part of this massive socialist experiment.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service. The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK. We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception.

– Mr President, what is the most commonly used word in association with the euro? No, it is not ‘failure’ – although it could be. It is ‘stability’, is it not? A decade ago, everybody said that once we had the euro currency, it would bring us stability. Well, a decade on, I would suggest that what it has brought is chaos, discord and misery for millions, and yet the word ‘stability’ is still being used this morning. Mr Barroso used it, Mr Van Rompuy used it: ‘stability’. In fact, we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in Portugal went well last week, whereas the reality is that the European Central Bank was actually using taxpayers’ money to buy their own debt. Your reassurances that all is well do not work. Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Van Rompuy? Bond yields in Portugal rose to nearly 7% yesterday. The public right across the Union no longer supports the currency, and the battle for Spain has not even begun. The model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail-out fund. You even want to increase the scope of the bail-out fund so that, along with the ECB, you, too, can go on buying yet more of your own debt. You are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union. If you succeed, then we should change the name: get rid of ‘European Union’ and call it the ‘Debt Union’. If you do succeed, you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison, in which people’s suffering will be untold, while the northern countries will find themselves paying, forever, a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies. We have reached a point where it actually does not matter what any of you say. Nobody believes you. The public does not support you. I hope and pray the markets break you. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I did say a decade ago that you could not have Greece and Germany put together in the same monetary union and that it would not work. If you go back through history, you find that when people are put together in false currency unions, when governments think they know better than the markets, governments always lose. You ask me what my solution is today. It is absolutely as plain as a pikestaff. Greece, Portugal and Ireland do not fit inside the euro. What we should be doing, what Mr Van Rompuy should be doing in order to give real leadership, is to be introducing a plan B and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency, to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance, because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, I welcome Mr Orbán. After the six months’ farce of the Belgian Presidency, it is nice to see an elected Prime Minister from a proper country. How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology – and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union. Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically, you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union. In fact, you are going to meet lots of Communists over the next six months, including the boss of the Commission here, old Barroso who was an advocate of Chairman Mao! You will see centralised economic planning and control and, above all, what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of Europe without their consent. Wake up Mr Orbán. Look at how they are trying to bully you this morning. They are trying to tell you how to run your own country. Tell them where to go. Stand up and fight for democracy once again. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, 2010 will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in Europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders. So here we have another summit, another crisis, confidence in the euro ebbing by the week. It is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism. You think that, if you have a fund of say a billion euros, all will be well. Well it will not be well. The failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation. It is nothing to do with the markets, be they currency or bonds, it is because the North and the South in Europe cannot today, or at any point, be put together in a single monetary union. It will not work. And politically, of course, you have to change the treaty. The reason being that the four German professors will win at Karlsruhe and prove that the bail-outs you have put in place already were in fact illegal under the treaties. Well, in many ways I welcome this treaty change because it will mean that there has to be a referendum in Ireland. And you never know, David Cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the United Kingdom. I am sure that, as democrats, you would all welcome a referendum on the EU in the United Kingdom. We should also reflect at the end of 2010 not just on the state of the Union, but on the state of Belgium. For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply. What a farce this is. You have not had a government in your own country since June. Here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation. It truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial. Belgium is a microcosm of the entire European Union. Belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow. Happy Christmas, everybody. David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, the recent WikiLeaks storm has led to mixed feelings, with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy. However, I was particularly amused by the references to you in WikiLeaks, where it mentioned your trip to Russia and the fact that you were ignored and excluded and the Russian view from upon high that you were nothing more than a glorified international civil servant. Mr Barroso, remember: we have discussed this before here. I have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy. Is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage, and why increasingly, the peoples of Europe are holding you and the entire Commission in contempt? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Well, Mr Barroso, I enjoyed that enormously! That you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept I have come across in my entire life. The fact is that the Commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging Europe’s economies in the way that it is. Are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of Europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues? (Interjections from the floor from various Members) Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy has been in office for one year, and in that time the whole edifice is beginning to crumble. There is chaos. The money is running out. I should thank Mr Van Rompuy. He should perhaps be the pin-up boy of the Eurosceptic movement. But just look around this Chamber this morning, Mr Van Rompuy. Just look at these faces. Look at the fear. Look at the anger. Poor old Barroso here looks like he has seen a ghost. You know, they are beginning to understand that the game is up and yet, in their desperation to preserve their dream, they want to remove any remaining traces of democracy from the system. It is pretty clear that none of you have learned anything. When you yourself, Mr Van Rompuy, say that the euro has brought us stability, I suppose I could applaud you for having a sense of humour. But is this not really just the bunker mentality? Your fanaticism is out in the open. You talked about the fact that it was a lie to believe that the nation state could exist in the 21st
-century globalised world. Well, that may be true in the case of Belgium – which has not had a government for six months – but for the rest of us, right across every Member State in this Union (and perhaps this is why we see the fear in the faces), people are increasingly saying: ‘We don’t want that flag, we don’t want the anthem, we don’t want this political class, we want the whole thing consigned to the dustbin of history’. We had the Greek tragedy earlier on this year, and now we have the situation in Ireland. I know that the stupidity and greed of Irish politicians has a lot to do with this. They should never have joined the euro. They suffered with low interest rates, a false boom and a massive bust. But look at your response to them. What they are being told, as their government is collapsing, is that it would be inappropriate for them to have a general election. In fact, Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget first before they would be allowed to have a general election. Just who the hell do you people think you are? You are very dangerous people indeed. Your obsession with creating this euro-state means that you are happy to destroy democracy. You appear to be happy for millions of people to be unemployed and to be poor. Untold millions must suffer so that your euro-dream can continue. Well it will not work, because it is Portugal next. With their debt levels of 325% of GDP, they are the next ones on the list. After that, I suspect it will be Spain. The bailout for Spain would be seven times the size of Ireland’s, and at that moment, all the bailout money will have gone. There will not be any more. But it is even more serious than economics, because if you rob people of their identity, if you rob them of their democracy, then all they are left with is nationalism and violence. I can only hope and pray that the euro project is destroyed by the markets before that really happens.David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Should this Parliament not demand their immediate release, and – I must be careful how I say this – is this ‘piste war’ not totally in breach of EU rules?

 Mr President, I happen to have been at the United Nations and Security Council yesterday, in snowy New York. I support this UN multilateral treaty on controlling conventional arms sales both in general terms and because it has been signed by the UK.  It is vital here to stress the difference between the United Nations, which is intergovernmental – i.e. agreements are made between the governments of 193 individual nations, 154 of which have signed this agreement – and the European Union, which is supra- or trans-national – i.e. it cuts above or across nation states. I do not agree with that approach. Indeed, the official UN brochure I have here says that the UN is not a super-state, nor is it a world government. The states members of the UN remain sovereign and equal and have no intention of delegating this sovereignty to any supra-national entity. The point is that, as long as this report does acknowledge decision-making is done at national state level, then it is an advance. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),

I made the decision to vote against this report as I do not agree in principle with a new EU action for the European Capitals of Culture, which it has seized from the Council of Europe. This is the European Union promoting a shared European cultural identity which I see as undermining the identities of Member States. I do not see the European Capitals of Culture as a valid use of time and funding and it will be even more of a detriment if used as a political and ideological tool to foist a non-existent cultural brand on Member States. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -   
Madam President, all of us here value and support human rights, but people are deeply concerned about excessive rights for criminals, murderers and terrorists. The European Court of Human Rights, across the water over here, wants the UK to give the vote to prisoners, and in the EU we have the Fundamental Charter of Human Rights, under Lisbon, and the havoc caused in trade deals as a result of it.   At the same time, the EU is supporting Edward Snowden, who is a traitor in the US. And in this report we have the European instrument for democracy and human rights. It has a budget of over a billion euros and what is it doing? Well, it spent USD 2.6 million in the USA to oppose the death penalty. That is a matter for America, not the EU. The EU must stop trying to run the world when it cannot even get its own accounts signed off. I oppose yet more EU waste. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I voted against this report as it is a gross intervention in national affairs and national sovereignty. There may indeed be rights abuses in Hungary, but it is for the Hungarian people to address these concerns and not the EU. This is how the EU works: it takes a good cause such as this and it makes it its business, but it is not the EU’s business. This idea of a wise men group, an investigative body of MEPs looking into the rights of all 28 Member States – we are not just talking about Hungary in this report – takes away our democratic rights; it does not add to those rights.  I think this proposal crosses the Rubicon and, just as when Julius Caesar crossed that Rubicon, there is no way back. It marks the start of a European empire interfering in nation states’ matters. And as Julius Caesar said, the die is indeed cast. I think this report absolutely says that. We must go against this. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I know that Mr Duff is commendably honest and direct about being an arch-federalist – a true believer in the European superstate. That is something that five million people in the East of England have no desire for at all, and it is noticeable that his party, the Lib Dems, is not supporting a democratic ‘in/out’ referendum vote this Friday in Westminster.  However, this report is outrageous even in federalist terms. It advocates that European political parties should stand in British elections, complete with their own emblems and their own political broadcasts on TV. I believe that the EPP here is already busy raising GBP 5 million to spend on the forthcoming election. The report is in favour of European political parties nominating candidates like Mr Barroso for the post of President of the European Commission. I think this is a false and worthless measure, a sort of GDR-style democracy. The report also advocates extending candidacy to EU citizens … (The President cut off the speaker) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, these proposals have created great concern in my constituency in the east of England. They cover powered two- and three-wheelers, light trailers, tractors and older cars. It does seem to be a case of just trying to harmonise because of a political super-state, rather than because of any real need, value or urgency. If you take motorcycles in particular, EU studies actually find that less than 1% of motorcycle crashes are directly caused by defects, so this proposal really is not needed. Parliament’s own Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have rejected these proposals. I feel that this proposal is completely disproportionate to any problems it claims to solve. It goes against subsidiarity, which should enable national measures for national road safety priorities, and it really does seem to be another case of looking for a solution to a problem that does not exist, and merely increases cost and bureaucracy. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, I welcome the limited reforms passed today. All credit should go to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall for his sterling efforts on this issue, and also to the ECR group. I fear, however, that this is still rather like spraying perfume on a long-dead fish: the bad odour lingers. The common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a disaster. Not only has it failed to secure fish stocks, but it has also failed to help the employment situation in fishing, around the UK and around Europe. The fishing community in the east of England has been devastated by the CFP. And the issue of discards in particular, the fact that good, perfectly edible fish – up to 90% of them in some areas – are dumped back in the sea, is a complete disgrace. Given that Norway and Iceland have not had a policy of discards, and call such a policy criminal, why has it taken the EU so long to follow them? Provisions such as Amendment 119, which I voted against today, seeking to allow discards, are still a disgrace. The problem continues. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, this proposal is the thin end of a giant EU wedge. It is an attempt to introduce harmonised EU taxation and a common tax regime for the EU. It is intended to save the euro zone, but it is a bit like a drowning man pulling others down with him. While it only applies to eleven countries now, it will be expanded. You can see that happening. The City of London, as one of the largest financial centres in the world, will be its aim. Therefore, I vigorously oppose this proposal. The Dutch Finance Minister called it catastrophic, and the Swedish Finance Minister called it a very dangerous thing. This is a disastrous proposal and I voted to veto it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, the people of my country are very concerned at paying yet more money to the EU. We are paying GBP 53 million a day gross, which is GBP 30 million a day net. We are also talking now of GBP 118 billion a year in terms of red tape or regulations, and the accounts have still not been signed off for the EU for 18 years in a row.  This is not good enough – and now the EU wants one-and-a-half billion more this year and yet more for the next seven years. What planet is the EU living on? Is it Mars or Venus or Pluto? This is not real. What is real is that the people of Greece are suffering; the conditions in Greece now are worse than Germany in the 1930s because of the political euro. That is a disgrace, and here we are in Strasbourg – 200 million euros a year to come back and forward between Brussels and Strasbourg. This is a disgrace; we must cut back on the budget. Not a penny more till the EU gets its house in order. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, this resolution is completely unacceptable. It is the equivalent of sending EU tanks across national borders. There is no acceptable EU role in these vital, strategic and offence responsibilities, and no role for Commission legislation. Just look at the language. The EU ‘should be a global political player on the international scene’ it says, ‘to protect its
 interests in the world and to ensure the security of its
 citizens’. All under the roof of a single political authority. It says, the EU has ‘an important role to play as security provider for the Member States’ and it wants mergers of European businesses to contribute to European defence industry. Well, here is the real aim of this shameful BAE/EADS merger proposal. But worst of all, it wants to take the EU to war. It talks of having the ‘full range of possibilities for action on the international scene’, of intervening ‘in all types of crisis, including […] high intensity conflicts’ – and that means war. No, this resolution must be stopped in its tracks. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Madam President, I very much welcome Russia joining the WTO. I think the issue, though, is about whether Russia successfully adopts WTO procedures. What does joining the WTO actually mean in practice? The official commitments include non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, reducing tariffs and binding tariff levels, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights and foregoing the use of local content requirements and other investment measures which limit imports. It also requires them to open government procurement contract opportunities to foreign firms and to accept that the WTO will settle trade dispute procedures. That is quite a long list for Russia to sign up to. It is quite a challenge for Russia. For example, Russia has export duties on no less than 450 types of products at the moment, and duties will be reduced from 19 % to an average of 8 %. Russia is still a tough place to do business. It is ranked 120 in the world ‘ease of doing business’ rankings, and Putin called the accession process to the WTO an ambush of Russian economic interests. So I very much welcome the move towards the WTO, but there are some tough challenges ahead. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have to say that I can scarcely believe these proposals. I feel that they are utter nonsense and it should worry democrats that two-thirds of MEPs supported this motion. I did not. How can we throw money away on such nonsense when the peoples of Europe are hurting? As they are in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in France and in my own country. The EU is clearly hopelessly out of touch with the people it purports to represent. At a time when Angela Merkel today is threatening to veto the entire budget summit if David Cameron vetoes anything but a freeze, this is crazy. David Cameron is trying to do the right thing. Are the peoples of Europe, in between paying higher taxes, in between job cuts and riots, turning to one another to say that what we really need is a Year of European Citizenship? No, absolutely not. Nor am I a citizen of the EU, but a loyal subject of the Queen. The idea is flawed, insulting and an utter waste of money. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against this report as I find the notion of a single European railway area a ridiculous, unnecessary and unwelcome intrusion into domestic affairs. There is no need for Fritz the Tank Engine or for a single EU Fat Controller for our railways. It is true that international, rather than regional, agreements are valuable for air and maritime transport, as are single market measures for rail suppliers. But the United Kingdom is a large island with only one rail connection with continental Europe and it has no road connections at all. So for road and rail, it does not work. I think this proposal does nothing but confuse priorities and drive up costs. In East Anglia, my constituency, hard-pressed rail users do not stand on platforms demanding a single European railway area. They need better services, less crowding and reasonable ticket prices. This is a silly single rail area proposal and it should not be allowed. It should not leave the station. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, the ACTA agreement is one I wish I could champion. I very much agree we need measures to counter piracy and protect intellectual property, which is vital to business, but I cannot support this ACTA. It is not acceptable in its current form. It is too catch-all. Whilst the thrust of the agreement is worthy, the devil is in the detail. In the detail, we find that Internet service providers will be forced to spy on all their customers, Chinese-state style, becoming legally responsible for pirated files. Search engines could be closed for aiding and abetting. In this ACTA, we have what I call ‘pre-crime’, as in the movie Minority Report
, where you can have your PCCs on the mere suspicion of infringement. You have a loose definition of commercial scale, which could see many law-abiding citizens prosecuted for very low-key usage. You have customs officers able to go through your files at airports, and we have this unaccountable ACTA committee which has the power to make changes without referring back to this Parliament or others. In conclusion, I support the aim but I do not support the detail of ACTA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– I have read it in English so I do understand it. I have taken the trouble to go through this and so have my researchers. I think honestly you have to judge it on the legal detail in that agreement. That is what I have made my decision on, not on a lot of e-mails I have received – we have all received those – but on the actual detail and what it says in that agreement. I do not think, unfortunately, that that is acceptable. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted for this as I believe that trade, rather than aid, is a better way to assist less developed countries to prosper. However, I want to make a wider point about tariff reduction and trade agreements relevant to all of us. Here, we see preferential access to the EU single market being given to nations which are not members of the EU but which get reduced – or even zero – tariff walls from the EU customs union. Yet they do not have to sign up to financial contributions to the EU or to a whole body of law, the acquis
, and can trade pretty freely. It goes to show how far we have travelled from the 1970s world of high tariffs and menacing trade walls and how much has been achieved by the WTO and GATT in reducing barriers to trade around the world. We can all benefit from much looser trading relations and lower tariff walls. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report as it is another classic case of the right idea but in the wrong place. Of course we all want to see better human rights records around the world. I personally raised the issue of human rights with President Santos of Colombia last year and I was impressed with his commitment to improve human rights in a country which has suffered from 50 years of guerrilla warfare. But this is to confuse political agreements about political measures with trade agreements, which should be about jobs and market access. Trade agreements are not trade agreements when they become weighed down with non-trade issues. No matter how worthy those issues are, it is not desirable or effective to confuse the two, nor can you switch trade agreements on and off like light switches, as this report suggests, so that every accusation on human rights leads to the suspension of the agreement. That is a recipe for chaos, confusion and misery, for lost jobs and lost opportunities, and we cannot afford that, especially not at this time. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have two questions to ask Baroness Ashton as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Firstly, I do not understand what the EU role is in this United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Here is a very welcome agreement concluded by the intra-governmental United Nations with 193 nation states involved – only Zimbabwe voted against it – so nation states and the UN are at one. Why, then, do we need a supranational trespasser, in the form of the EU, to muscle in on the action? A second related question is what role does the European Defence Agency (EDA) have, given its arms export control policy? At least EDA, again, is international, not supranational. But why did it allegedly take you from 1 December 2009, when you were appointed as Head of the EDA, to January 2012 – two years – to actually visit its premises? It is only 15 minutes from your Brussels office. Is it actually so low priority? David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I am very much in favour of equal work for equal value and of fair treatment, but the issue here is: who enforces that? We do not need the EU to dictate to sovereign nations yet more top-down equalities legislation in yet another power grab. Pay should not be set at the EU level. With the state of the European economies at present, this enforcement really does not help – it is like tying weights to someone who is already drowning. Already the engine of our economies – small businesses – are suffering from too many unnecessary, costly and over-the-top regulations, such as the disgraceful, out-of-control UK employment tribunal system, where 90% of those laws come from the EU and which really acts as licensed blackmail. Thankfully, the UK Government is cutting that back. But business really does not need this – not when one in five young people in the EU are out of work and when the EU share of GDP wealth is falling so alarmingly. We have to ensure that all intervention is constructive; this is not. Then there is the EU’s Equality Directive, which was dressed up as Harriet Harman’s Equality Act. Civitas actually estimated that that directive alone cost GBP 150 million in the service sector and 210 million across SMEs, across the UK. It is too much. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Kolarska-Bobińska, no, absolutely not. I do compliment the report. As I said quite clearly, I am in favour of equal pay for equal work. That principle is very important. What I query is whether this should be done at EU level. I do not believe it should be; it should be for nation states. However, I absolutely agree with you on the principle. It is the intervention at EU level, the heavy costs of that and the power of the EU over sovereign states that I object to. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Morin-Chartier, I agree with that. I accept in this report that career breaks actually cause a lot of loss of income and affect this. As I say, I am very much in favour in the thrust of it. What I am saying is that this should be down to nation states to do and should not be enforced – which this legislation associated with a good report does. That is the problem. It is not the report, because that is a very good report in many respects. It is the legislation, done top-down from the EU, which I object to. The great thrust of it is very good, but it should be done through nation states. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the ECR Group. 
– Mr President, I am alarmed at the tendency of the European Union to trespass into areas of national sovereignty where it does not belong; this is another example of that trend. It is the rightful business of the Canadian Government – and not us – to decide who it lets into its country, and why. Canada is not discriminating against us Europeans: it introduced similar restrictions for Mexicans, even though Mexico is in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada has successfully lifted the requirement for temporary visas where conditions are met. It has done so for Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary. There seems to be serious confusion in the Commission’s stance in two regards. Firstly, there is confusion as to whether such visa matters belong in free trade agreements. They do not; just as ‘Mode 4’ worker access is not appropriate in the draft EU/India free trade agreement, so traveller visa matters do not belong in this Canadian free trade agreement. Border issues like this are a matter for Member States. The second point of confusion is about the European Union being a country. Yes, it aspires to be a country, but it is not one yet. So it is not the business of this place to force Canada to treat every EU nation equally, as if we were one country. That is a matter for individual nation states working through their own embassies. The Canadians have laid down fair and reasonable criteria, including low immigration violation rates, low asylum claims, high integrity of travel documents and good cooperation on removals. Those are reasonable terms. If this principle is breached, however, every EU Member State can expect the EU to start dictating all its border matters, and many EU Member States may well dislike losing control of their own borders to EU diktats. France and Spain have suspended Schengen on occasion, as has Spain this month, and the Dutch have tried to block Bulgaria and Romania. So in conclusion, Mr President, this is a line in the sand; a legal and political border that the EU must not cross. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Parvanova, I think the point you are missing is that they are all nation states. The objection I have is to pretending that the EU is one country and saying that we are trying to force equality on Canada as if the EU were one country. By all means let the national embassies argue with the Canadian authorities and do it for themselves, but I do not think the EU should be acting this way, and certainly not within free trade agreements. I am on the Committee on International Trade, and too much leeway is being given to items which are not to do with trade and jobs. Europe desperately needs trade and jobs at this point. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– The answer is that, as part of being a member of the European Union, every member country, such as Britain, has to hand over the negotiation of free trade agreements to the EU. I personally think that Britain should be outside the European Union and negotiate its own free trade agreements, as do Norway and Switzerland – and we would get a better result. That is the reason that is driving it. I am in favour of trade and of helping Europe get better jobs – I think we all are here – but I think there are better ways of doing it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because I do not believe that the EU should be involved in social security matters. I think it is trespassing on international responsibilities, and it seems to be a world away from the trade agreement that the EU is meant to be about. I am particularly concerned about one aspect. I was self-employed myself: I ran a consultancy. This report refers to paying unemployment benefits to the self-employed throughout the EU. This again is undermining our flexible economy. In Britain, when you are self-employed, you do things your own way and it gives people a lot of freedom. I think that is undermining this freedom. This report may be about technical matters but I am totally against it on principle. The EU should keep out of social security, pension and benefit matters. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report, not because I do not believe in human rights – I very much do – but because Conservative MEPs and I all feel that human rights are really about balance and getting the balance right. I have to say that my colleague who wrote this report, Richard Howitt, did not show much balance when he supported the rights of illegal travellers on illegal pitches at Dale Farm, whilst ignoring the rights of those local people who were so badly affected by them. That showed contempt for the rule of law. I am concerned that there is also a lack of balance in this report over things such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Just yesterday, the British Government acted – quite rightly – to arrest Abu Qatada, who is an alleged terrorist and a man who has actually praised the hijackers of 9/11, after eight years. It took eight years to do that because of human rights legislation. This report supports that move towards the EU Convention on Human Rights and EU support for it. So, let us get the balance right. Human rights are good, but if the balance is not correct, it weakens the whole case for them. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, at a time of economic difficulty across the world, and particularly in the eurozone, and with the EU budget itself under enormous pressure, I cannot see the justification for shelling out huge amounts of cash this way. The report talks of up to EUR 6 000 per head per refugee, and a minimum of EUR 4 000. Britain has a noble history of providing shelter to genuine asylum seekers and takes more than its fair share of the load, but these common EU priorities of ‘resettlement’ are unwelcome, unhelpful and unaffordable. That is why I voted against this fund. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because it shows all so clearly that the British people were lied to about the true intention of the European Union project. It is about take-over, not about trade. This Vălean report wants harmonised tax, social security, state benefits, pensions, even divorce laws right across the EU. What is this to do with trade? What is this to do with the common market? It is about harmonising arrangements to create a single European state. Well, I am not an EU citizen and I will not be an EU citizen. I am a loyal subject of Her Majesty The Queen, in her 60th year of rule, and this Vălean report is an insult to that loyalty. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I voted against Iceland joining the EU because I think, as two-thirds of Icelandic people thought in a poll just last month, that Iceland would be mad to join the EU. Mad because membership would destroy Iceland’s key industry – fishing – through the disastrous common fisheries policy, just as it has destroyed 100 000 jobs in the UK in fishing and nearly all the fishing in my own constituency of the East of England. Mad because they would have to join the disastrous euro as well and abandon the free floating króna, which has brought a boom in exports. Mad, too, because its economy would be weighed down with a barrage of EU red tape. Its growth rate is currently 3.1%, whereas the EU’s GDP forecast is 0 for this year. Why risk it? As for Icesave, there are other legal mechanisms outside the EU, such as the EFTA court, which has already ruled that Iceland must pay up. So we must stop kidding ourselves in the EU that Iceland wants to join. Iceland’s sane option, as I believe Britain’s is too, is to stay proud, independent and self-governing. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against EU stability bonds, or Eurobonds, as they fail to address the central problem: the euro itself. It is clear the euro is a dangerous and failed construct, and no political posturing or economic gesturing gets us away from the basic truth that the euro is disastrous for the world economy. The sooner troubled nations like Greece devalue and default, the better. The cure is now more dangerous and deadly than the malady. Is there no end to these desperate measures to prop up this political currency? The trampling of democracy in Greece, Italy and elsewhere by the EU’s new inner politburo, the Frankfurt Group, so that Europe erupts in flames. Barroso and Van Rompuy going cap in hand to China for rescue funds – and at what price? Gerrymandering Lagarde into the IMF so the IMF is misused as a new euro bailout fund. Weimar-like plans to print EUR 2 trillion to buy rubbish bonds; new wheelbarrows to carry all the notes. For God’s sake, for all our sakes, let the euro go. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report. Whilst I salute what David Cameron did for defending vital national interests over the rules at the recent summit, actually the purpose of it was to put in place a financial plan to save the euro and it failed to do that. In my view, what is much more scary than the full or partial collapse of the euro – damaging as that would be – is the notion of the European Central Bank printing EUR 2 trillion or more with nothing to back the paper they are printing. I think Angela Merkel is right, but she has been isolated on this because she wants to avoid the nightmare scenario, quite rightly, of a return to the Weimar Republic. In my view, it is better for an orderly end to the euro, or parts of the euro, than wheelbarrows full of worthless notes. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). 
 – Mr President, this vote reflects on the similarities and differences between the United States of America and the aspirate United States of Europe, or USE. The US is democratic, free-trading, entrepreneurial and capitalist; the USE is corporatist, protectionist, statist and interventionist. The US are states of a federal country with one prevailing culture and speaking one language; the USE is made up of nation states, very different to just states, and has a multitude of cultures and languages. The US has the dollar, a single currency that is still strong despite a debt of USD 12 trillion. The USE has a single currency on the point of collapse. And when Americans have frequent referenda and elect even insurance commissioners and registers of deeds; the USE puts Soviet-style placemen, little Honeckers at the head of its nation states. This statement may accentuate the similarities, but in truth, the differences are plain to see. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I am deeply unimpressed with this idea of a European Heritage Label ‘to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the EU’. Once again, we seem to have a scary 1984-style rewriting of history, just like the wasteful Museum of European History, where no-one can agree when this history is due to start and where, of course, no-one can mention the war. This is an Orwellian exercise that seeks to term World Wars as mere European civil wars, with the realities obscured in a haze of half-truths. In Brussels last week a French lady insulted my red Remembrance Day poppy as ‘out of date’. I find it disgusting that a symbol of the huge sacrifice that has guaranteed all our freedoms should be treated with such contempt. That poppy commemorates, too, the British soldier who died just last week in Afghanistan. History may be inconvenient and painful but, by God, you get into far more trouble seeking to deny its realities. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I speak as someone with a railway industry background. I worked for Britain’s passenger railways, the Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link, and as a ministerial adviser. Whilst I support the concept of a British-style model of liberalised rail services, which has given the UK the fastest-growing railways in Europe, of track charges, of open access, of train leasing and of a strong and independent rail regulator, I simply do not see this as anything to do with the European Union. Britain has 10 000 miles of rail lines and only one line is connected to Europe. Continental-gauge trains would not even fit on our lines in Britain. They would demolish our bridges and tunnels with their bulk. So I am sorry, but this idea of a single European railway area is a nonsense. It is unnecessary, undesirable and excessive interference in the responsibilities of national governments, so I do not support this report. In short, will the EU please keep off our tracks!

 My hobby is writing film scripts so I declare an interest in this subject. But whilst this report might claim to be about new ‘Cinema Paradiso’s, it is more likely to lead to ‘Cinema Disastroso’. Why does the EU want to discriminate against non-European films? Firstly, this is a form of non-tariff barrier and against WTO rules. Second, filmmaking is incredibly international these days – defining a non-European film is difficult: is Harry Potter or James Bond an American film for its production, finance and distribution, or British by dint of talent, theme, location and studios used? The ‘Fifth Element’ may be directed by Frenchman Luc Besson but Bruce Willis is the star. Even the iconic French film ‘Chocolat’ had substantial US support. Third, you simply cannot force people to watch films they do not want to see. European movies can be winners without giving away seats: ‘Chocolat’ took USD 71 million at the box office, ‘Amélie’ USD 152 million and “The King’s Speech” USD 386 million. Any support for film is better targeted on developing good stories or in skills development, not in seeking to prop up films no one wants to see. That is why on principle I could not vote for this report, whilst being very much in support of the film industry. David Campbell Bannermann  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I am a friend of Israel but I am a critical friend of Israel. I myself worked with the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process and it is illusory to believe in a military solution; it has to be a political solution, and that involves negotiation. Legal settlements do not help that process. I do feel for the Palestinian people who have been very badly treated; I do believe that they need a state living in peace with Israel, side by side. However, I am not sure that this measure – which is a good negotiating tactic – of going straight to the UN to create a state is the right way forward, so I abstained on this vote. However, I do wish that the peace process moves forward. I think that is essential. But only painstaking negotiation, as we saw in the Northern Ireland peace process, can bring a political solution of benefit to everyone. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, many people have no idea how much national legislation emanates from the European Union. In the UK, it is estimated that there are now 100 000 laws, regulations, directives and decisions which come from the EU and have been imposed on the country. It is estimated that this collective legal burden, known as corpus juris
, costs between 4% and 10% of annual wealth in Britain. It is also estimated that the cost of such over-regulation is EUR 600 billion a year across the EU, and GBP 118 billion within the UK. Surely it is time to turn off this legislative sausage machine. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I commend my colleague, Sajjad Karim, on a sensible report that takes us back in the right direction. The emphasis on subsidiarity is correct. 90% of the British economy has nothing to do with trade with the EU, and 80% of that economy is trade within the UK, but we have to apply all of these EU laws – 100 000 of them. On better legislation, the Agency Workers Directive, which will shortly be coming into force, is a disaster for Britain because, in the UK, we have a far more flexible workforce, which is vital to our prosperity and to our recovery. The question is why, when 80% of agency workers are in the UK, the EU should have any role in this legislation at all. The same is true of the dreadful Fund Managers Directive, where again 80% of fund managers are only in the UK. The lesson is this: overregulation destroys jobs, and we need less regulation now. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

– Mr President, I may have changed my seat here to the ECR Group this week, but I have not changed my perspective on the European Union. When it comes to Schengen, it has been the ECR view that this is generally a matter for Schengen area members to decide, including Switzerland, of course, which is in Schengen, but not in the European Union. But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis. Pragmatism dictates that the implications of Bulgaria and Romania joining are profound for those way beyond the Schengen area. A leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the UK can reach Calais without hindrance, for example, and Bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime. In summary, this proposal is simply a border too far. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, Europe Day this week was supposed to be a celebration of European national identity. It is not. It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government, meaning above nation states. This is in contrast to intergovernmental, where nation states freely cooperate, but do not cede powers to a higher central authority. The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference. The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain, France and the United States, whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons. The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation. In contrast, the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron’s proposal for a no-fly zone. It is ironic that the Red Baroness herself, Cathy Ashton, stood against this no-fly proposal, her aide reportedly calling it ‘headline grabbing desperation’. The lesson of this is that principal nations act intergovernmentally while supranational bodies merely fiddle as Libya burns.

– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others. Therefore, UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments, but voted a resounding ‘No’ to the report as a whole. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

– Mr President, in Britain, the first day of April is called April Fool’s Day and people take great delight in fooling one another. So when some report that Iceland is on course to join the EU next year, I think: ‘April Fool!’ In reality, a survey has shown that 64% of Icelanders want to remain independent, only 24% want to carry on applying for EU membership and, indeed, 60% of Icelandic businesses are against it. It is also said that Iceland wants the security of the euro. April Fool! Even Portugal’s own banks are currently refusing to buy Portuguese bonds. Iceland will neither give up its rich fishing grounds – producing 40% of its exports – to join the disastrous common fisheries policy, nor abandon an Icelandic Parliament that is more than 1 000 years old and the winner of a UNESCO award for democracy. Even with a banking hangover, Iceland, like Britain, remains better off outside. No fooling there! David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, whilst good Libyan people are being bombed and terrorised by Mr Gaddafi, the EU has been shelling out on projects for Libya like ‘enhancing respect for international humanitarian law’. It is pretty obvious that has not worked. Meanwhile, Baroness Ashton here is demanding yet more resources, on top of the almost EUR 3 billion the External Action Service is due to receive. Instead of being immersed further in this bloated, duplicating and insatiable EU foreign service and European Defence Agency, Britain should spend the GBP 48 million a day we pay for EU membership on our own national defence interests. The Libyan crisis has shown the value of having aircraft carriers with fast jets stationed off crisis zones. I appeal to David Cameron to see sense and reprieve both the carrier HMS Ark Royal, and at least a minimum number of Harriers. During the Falklands crisis, Mrs Thatcher successfully reprieved the Ark’s sister ship, HMS Invincible. We must do the same for the Ark Royal. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

 UKIP wants the UK to leave the European Union and retain friendly trading links through a UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, similar to that with non-EU Switzerland and Norway. I voted in favour of this EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement as it can be a model and a template for a future UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, and because it demonstrates that tariff-free and favourable trading access to the EU can be achieved without the UK (or South Korea) being a member of the EU. This is especially true in the case of the UK, which would be the EU’s largest single trading partner. A UK-EU Free Trade Agreement would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the UK as a member of the EU, and would therefore require far less negotiation (e.g. over tariff reductions) than did the agreement with South Korea.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service. The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK. We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception.

 The UK Independence Party fully supports the cause of genuine human rights. However, we note that the EU’s interpretation of human rights is a flawed one.

 Madam President, this banana is the stuff of war – an EU-inspired trade war with America that has lasted 16 years and has now been lost spectacularly. The EU has now been fined nearly USD 200 million by the World Trade Organisation and been forced to drop its illegal tariffs – all because of the protectionism that lies at the heart of the EU, in this case protection of French colonies. May I say that this very banana which I bought today in the European Parliament supermarket is illegal! It does not conform to EU rules in terms of the length, the width and the straightness of bananas. What is going on? With such barmy protectionism and such silly rules as this, one has to ask: is the European Union crazy or has it merely gone bananas? David Campbell Bannerman,

 – Madam President, in discussing the Black Sea area, one word leaps to mind, and that is ‘caution’. All must tread carefully here. The Black Sea area is Russia’s backyard. It has its fleet anchored in the Crimea at Sebastopol, close to the bloody battlefields of the Crimean War. We have seen the unfortunate conflict in Georgia, where there was fault on both sides. Had Georgia been in NATO, the consequences could have been disastrous. Whilst I support Georgian independence, it is unwise to goad the Russian bear in its own lair. Then there is Turkey which the EU is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as France will veto an application. Turkey has just 4% of its landmass within Europe. It should not be in the EU. There are real dangers in leading Turkey on. Disappointment could drive Turkey into the hands of Islamic extremists. Finally, underlying all of this is the fact that the Black Sea is the hub for vital Caspian oil and gas. Tread carefully indeed. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, back in 2007, President Sarkozy denied any link between the release of five Bulgarian nurses from Libya and the Libyan order for French missiles worth EUR 240 million. These arms were sold to a country held responsible for the Lockerbie bombing and the supply of terrorist weapons. Yet even Gaddafi’s son suggested that there was a link between the two deals. It was arms for prisoners. In 2004, the EU removed the arms embargo against Libya in exchange for migration controls. That was arms for borders. Now, the London Times reports that Baroness Ashton suddenly wants to drop the EU arms embargo against China, which was imposed because of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, saying it is ‘a major impediment to developing stronger EU-China cooperation’. Actually, I believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro, is it not? Just like the Libyan deal, it seems the EU is so desperate now to save the euro that it is prepared to risk our collective security, as only the Chinese have enough money to rescue the euro. This is arms for bonds. Chinese foreign exchange reserves are USD 2.9 trillion. It has already bought Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds. However, China is also the country that bans the word ‘democracy’ from its search engines and executes thousands every year. So, I ask in all sincerity, just how low will the EU go to save the euro?

 Madam President, whilst we all unite in condemning flagrant human rights abuses in countries such as Iran and China, we must start distinguishing these from the grossly over-the-top EU-inspired human rights industry. The public are now bamboozled by this human rights fest. There is the EU Fundamental Charter of Human Rights in the Treaty of Lisbon; there is a European Court of Human Rights over there, which seeks to give British prisoners the vote – even murderers and paedophiles. There are excessive EU employment rights and American-style rights too for damages, and national legislation such as the UK’s disastrous Human Rights Act, which allows foreign terrorists and criminals to stay in Britain because their rights are now seen to be more important than those of the decent citizens they threaten. The truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough, with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists, criminals and the greedy. This has to stop. David Campbell Bannerman,

 Madam President, thank you for using my full name. I think we should celebrate the fact that NATO’s Lisbon Summit has strengthened protection for our peace and democracy, in direct contrast to the Treaty of Lisbon which is already doing quite the opposite. But NATO is threatened by the savage cuts being imposed on European armed forces. These are deeply dangerous. It is unforgiveable that the UK Government is slashing spending to below the 2% base level every NATO member is meant to honour. It is a false economy too, because defence spending brings good jobs. Today the British Harrier jet is removed from service. This month we lost the carrier HMS Ark Royal prematurely with the loss of 6 000 dedicated personnel. The USA cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us. We should be under no illusion that the Americans could pull out of NATO, as top British General Dannatt has warned, and leave us to an emboldened Russian bear still prepared to launch cyber attacks against Estonia and to systematically probe British sea and air defences, in disturbing echoes of the Cold War.

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, I know Ukraine from visits to Kiev and the Crimea and collect Ukrainian artists such as Tetenko and Shishko. The Ukrainians are a good, generous, warm-hearted people, but politically I would counsel great care. Ukraine is a country divided between a pro-western west and a Russian-facing east. It is also a big player, with 45 million citizens, and Russia sees the country as very much in its backyard. I have toured the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula. The Russians will jealously guard access to the Black Sea from there. Any talk of Ukraine joining NATO would be a sharp kick to the Russian Bear. A clumsy diplomatic approach by Baroness Ashton could exacerbate tensions at a difficult time, whilst the cost of forcing Ukraine into the EU in terms of farming subsidies, regional aid and mass migration would be prohibitive.

 UKIP accepts there are legitimate arguments about the death penalty, both for and against. However, UKIP feels that the decision to have or not have the death penalty is a decision that lies only with the individual nation state, and not the undemocratic EU. UKIP notes the attempts the EU has made to interfere with other countries’ policies in this area. It is not for the EU to bully any country into maintaining abolition or enacting abolition of the death penalty. UKIP also notes the way the EU has shut down any debate on this topic in the European context, despite public opinion on the subject. The maintenance or otherwise of the death penalty is, and should remain, a decision solely made at the nation state level via democratic means. Any state with the death penalty should ensure proper procedures of evidence collection, prisoner interrogation and fair trials.

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. David Campbell Bannerman,

– Mr President, the EU’s interest in the export of arms is clearly part of the increasing militarisation of the EU in the post-Lisbon era. Tony Blair himself told journalists just days ago that he wanted to see the EU develop a ‘military character’. A big part of this will be who the EU gets its weapons from and who it sells those weapons to. There is already talk that equipment produced for the EU army will not be interoperable with American equipment. The crazy notion of the British sharing an aircraft carrier with France would lose Britain access to US stealth technology overnight. It would also close the UK market to American imports and close the US market to British exports, destroying jobs on either side of the Atlantic. Defence exports are worth GBP 7 billion a year to the UK economy, that is the same as we pay to the EU in net contributions every year. We should oppose all such moves. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, there is something much deeper and more significant about the External Action Service, which is rooted in international law about what constitutes a nation state. Under the guiding 1933 Montevideo Convention, which the EU has accepted, there are four separate qualifications for a state: a permanent population, defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into diplomatic relations with other states. The EU already possesses three of these four: a permanent population – the Lisbon Treaty makes us all EU citizens; a defined territory – the EU nations all have clear, defined boundaries; a government – well, UKIP has long argued that this Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the real power, the Commission, are all part of an EU government. That leaves the fourth and final component: the capacity for a nation state to enter into relations with other nation states. I believe that through the Lisbon Treaty, through Baroness Ashton’s role and the External Action Service, the European Union now has all four criteria it needs under international law to declare itself a single nation state – a United States of Europe – and to do so overnight. (Applause from the centre and left)

– Madam President, I do not think any of us can fail to be sympathetic to the people of Kyrgyzstan for the recent suffering they have endured: 2 000 dead in rioting and 400 000 people displaced – mainly from the Uzbek community – placing enormous pressure on Uzbekistan. This is an immense crisis, in the words of the Red Cross. This country is already the poorest and the smallest of the former Soviet republics. It is tragic for a country that aspires so earnestly for parliamentary democracy to be in this kind of state. Indeed, the trigger seemed to have been the constitutional changes that they wished to aspire to. It is also one of the few Muslim nations in the world to be headed up by a woman; let us hope that Iran follows shortly. This lady, Roza Otunbayeva, is the first president of an ex-communist central Asian country – and good for her. All democratic nations should be doing all they can to support an aspiring parliamentary democracy of this sort, but it is swimming in a sea of powerful autocratic neighbours and with the ever-present threat of radical Islam on its borders. This nation is a bulkhead of democracy and deserves our support. I fear it has become a pawn in larger power games. It is now part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which China and Russia use to dominate the Central Asian landmass and whose agenda should be regarded with some suspicion. China and Russia have incentives to destabilise the country to threaten the presence of an American airbase there as well, with covert backing of opposition forces. May I conclude by saying that all democratic nations should support this brave, aspiring but deeply troubled nation. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer Report in the European Parliament because it is a sloppily-drafted dog’s dinner which does not clearly support country of origin labelling for simple foods like meats and eggs. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers selling their goods and for consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We have rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the consumer.

– Mr President, I have no doubt that all of us here are in favour of human rights. Indeed, many of these are rooted in the finest traditions of English laws – such as the Magna Carta of 1215, which outlawed arbitrary imprisonment, and the work of the British lawyers who wrote much of the European Convention on Human Rights after the war. But it seems that a worthy agenda of human rights has now been hijacked by greedy lawyers and political opportunists. Over the water from the UK, here in Strasbourg, sits the European Court of Human Rights. Now its Committee of Ministers has ruled that Britain must overturn its ban on allowing prisoners to vote because it violates the human rights of prisoners. But are human rights not meant to protect decent, law-abiding citizens, not terrorists, hijackers, murderers and law-breakers? Is it really any court’s job to ask us, as politicians, to seek votes from the likes of Ian Huntley, the paedophile who murdered two little girls in Soham, in my constituency? Is it justice to seek his approval? Is it right to knock on the cell door of Rose West, a serial killer, securing her support? And what of Abu Qatada, Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe? Who will he be voting for? Possibly the Liberal Democrats, because they support this nonsense! Yet, seriously, these large prison populations could swing marginal votes, especially at the local level. So there should be no equivalence of rights between decent, law-abiding citizens and those of murderers and criminals. They forfeited their right to participate in the political process when they took other people’s lives, other people’s rights and other people’s property. What about the rights of victims? What about human responsibilities rather than just rights? Like the euro, I believe the currency of human rights is rapidly being debased. We need a return to good common sense.

– UKIP do not support cancellation of debt on the basis that it is economically unsound on the following points: 1. A creditor nation is usually a debtor nation. For example, the UK is a significant donor of overseas aid. Yet the UK, and therefore its tax payers, are usually unwilling donors to aid recipients whilst debt mountains pile up for UK plc. 2. Debt cancellation impairs Third World debtor countries from raising further international finance. Therefore, it is not in the debtor nation’s interest. 3. Debt cancellation introduces moral hazard. What of Third World countries which meet debt obligations, of which there are many? 4. Cancellation implicitly condones fraud, corruption and the misappropriation of loans so endemic in African debtor countries. 5. Given the massive debt now of most international economies, who arbitrates where cancellation is appropriate? Further moral hazard. John Bufton  (EFD

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report.

Any amendments that we felt unnecessarily harmed British farmers were not supported, as were any amendments that expanded EU control in this sector. UKIP will continue to defend the interests of British farmers against EU interference, as we feel the British agricultural sector is perfectly capable of running its own affairs, and already has high standards of both quality and safety. UKIP opposes the way CAP has historically been used in corrupt ways (e.g. phantom vineyards) or the way it is used to top-up the income of certain politicians in EU countries who own ‘farms’. UKIP also objects to being forced to subsidise farms in other parts of Europe, which compete with our own farmers. UKIP is committed to trade in agricultural produce, under the terms of WTO rules.

 – Mr President, my French is not very good – pardonnez-moi –
 but I do understand that the French word ‘gouvernement
’ means government in English. I thought that was easy to understand. However, it does not seem to be easy for the British Labour Government or for President Van Rompuy. They seem to think it means governance, which is defined as the action or manner of governing. That is just dissembling, since the reality is that the EU Council’s agreement to improve economic EU gouvernement
 means the action of ruling and directing the affairs of a state. The truth, then, is that the Council has handed yet more powers over to the EU, including powers over the UK economy, which is the single most important issue to the British people today. When will people be told the truth? We are heading for an EU superstate, and Britain will have to pay to rescue those in the euro area – even though it is not, thankfully, a member of the euro itself.

It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability.

– Mr President, Amendment 1 of this housing resolution proposes to extend use of the European Regional Development Fund to all Member States, not just those joining in 2004. So this is directly relevant to Britain. It is clear from the resolution that the Roma population is the largest marginalised community in the report receiving support, plus others of similar socio-economic condition. The overall budget for the European cohesion policy is a staggering EUR 347 billion over seven years – larger than many economies, even. My constituents in East Anglia are already deeply concerned at the scale of the traveller and gypsy communities, particularly so in Essex. They will be angry should any of these measures facilitate yet more EU mass immigration. Britain has already seen a rise in population of three and a half million – half the size of London – in the 12 years since the Labour Government came to power in 1997. Given, too, that nearly nine out of ten new British homes – 86% – will be due to immigration over the next 30 years, proposals like these seem to be yet another bridgehead for major immigration into Britain. We do not have the room. It is about space, not race.

– Madam President, in my English constituency this week, it was discovered that scientists from the University of East Anglia were allegedly manipulating data to try and prove man-made global warming. What a giveaway that was! It is clear now that the scientific consensus on man-made global warming is fast eroding: 30 000 sceptical scientists in the Manhattan Declaration; 600 scientists in a US Senate report; even German scientists this year writing to Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, the author of the key UN report on this, Sir Nicholas Stern, urges us to become vegetarian to stop cows farting. Maybe it is not just certain cows that have gone mad. I am on the Committee on International Trade. I am deeply concerned with the WTO talks starting this week. I worry about a drift towards green tariffs justified on the basis of such spurious claims. These new tariffs are just barriers to trade, they punish the poor and have no justification whatsoever. This is just enviro-imperialism. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate. The wicked Lisbon constitution already forces an unelected President and Foreign Minister on us all. Now this report adds a new European diplomatic service, the so-called European External Action Service, but embassies represent national interests. So what national interests will these new EU diplomats and embassies represent? They will not be those of our nation states, our trade or our companies. They will be those of the European Commission. All other national embassies will become redundant. Already, British embassies around the world are selling off properties. This master plan for an EU superstate is built on foundations of deceit, dishonesty and denial, but federalists are not creating a new United States of America. They are creating a new Yugoslavia. By forcing very different nations, cultures and economies together under a rigid, undemocratic Soviet-style bureaucracy, you are entering very dangerous waters indeed. I worked for the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process. I saw what happened when democracy fails. It is not pretty. Now I see democracy failing here in Europe. You profess to love peace but, by railroading through Lisbon and by this power grab of our embassies, you are putting Europe firmly back on the road towards war once again.

− We acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, particularly for beef and sheep farmers in the South and East of England who, by wholesale vaccination on their own farms, have created a firewall against bluetongue that their fellow farmers in the North and West have benefited from. In order to vote for EU funding for this vaccine we are obliged (in the same vote) to vote for increased funding for Eurojust and Europol. These are two agencies that operate outside the boundaries acceptable to British law, severely increasing the power of the state at the expense of the liberty of the individual. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, we could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains our voting abstention on the subject. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this is my first, or maiden, speech in this Parliament. As a UKIP MEP for the East of England, you will expect me to be a rebel and I will try not to disappoint you or my voters. We are discussing today EU trade agreements and, in particular, that with South Korea, due to be signed this year. As we do not have much of the detail on this particular agreement, other than the fact, I believe, that two thirds of the benefits will accrue to South Korea and one third to the EU, I would like to make some more general points. Many people are not aware that there are over a hundred separate bilateral EU trade agreements like this one; 116 is one estimate. There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa. In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein. There are also trade agreements with non-EU EEA and EFTA countries such as Switzerland and Norway. Norway’s trade agreement religiously protects both its fishing and farming, and Norway is not a minnow. It is the EU’s fourth largest import partner and sixth largest export market. What should a trade agreement like South Korea’s really contain, then? Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example. There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products. There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland. There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area. The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU’s film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants. There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters. In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost. It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access, but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion, a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year. Nor is Switzerland an insignificant trading partner either: 80% of Swiss exports go to the EU, and it is the EU’s fourth largest trading partner. My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources. Even the Commission website admits ‘Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings. It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.’ How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers’ Directive or the new Fund Managers’ Directive! So I conclude in asking, why not Britain? Why cannot Britain have a similar, friendly trade agreement with the EU like South Korea instead of full EU membership? Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year. We, too, can have the kind of assurances the Swiss enjoy. We could, and I believe we should, be an independent free trading nation once again such as Norway, Switzerland and even South Korea. John Bufton  (EFD

This summit sees us discuss, once again, the EU’s Youth Employment Initiative, its place within wider efforts to foster growth, jobs and EU competitiveness, and the aim of making it fully operational by January 2014. The UK currently has a youth unemployment rate of 21 %. This means that approximately 1 million 18-25 year olds in the country are out of work. And, as of 1 January 2014, when 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians will be allowed to enter the country freely, the youth job market – and, more than likely, the job market as a whole – is sure to reach saturation point. We can sit here and discuss and dissect the Youth Employment Initiative all day and all night but my party and I quite simply cannot see how this initiative will make any real positive impact in our country. It is clear to me that the only way to ease the youth employment crisis we are currently facing in the UK is to leave the EU, regain proper control of our borders and make sure that any available jobs are done by our own young people.

According to the EU treaties, abortion is a matter of sovereign competence for the Member States, yet this report attempts to interfere with and override that fact. Furthermore, it is a fundamental part of human rights that parents should have the freedom to bring up their children according to their own choices and moral beliefs – enforcing compulsory sex education across the EU, as outlined in this report, is contrary to this right.

Firstly, it is important to emphasise that the UK is not part of this scheme. Moreover, we are against this directive as it supports a proposal, in the area of gathering and exchanging information on border security, which will give the Commission further power over immigration control.

I voted against this proposal as my party believes that the existing Batteries Directive prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated in devices or products, which contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight, with exceptions for certain categories of products.

I am not in favour of the creation or expansion of unified criminal law and criminal proceedings across the European Union.

This is an important issue, which should be covered by national legislation rather than by the EU. Ideally it should be possible to introduce and support practical anti-discriminatory measures.

This is another example of how citizens are fed up and disappointed with the EU: often, complainants resort to these petitions simply because it is seen as a way to protest.

I am against this directive because the UK already faces a number of immigration and healthcare challenges which would only increase if the directive were to be adopted. On the one hand, introducing a virtual professional qualifications card that would make it easier for European healthcare professionals to move and practice in other EU countries would cause a brain drain in some European countries that are in dire need of qualified healthcare professionals. On the other hand, it would increase the difficulties in already challenged labour markets in countries such as the UK, which are struggling to support local workers while dealing with an influx of legal and illegal immigration.

I prefer not to give our consent to such agreements, particularly as we have our own immigration policies in the UK and do not want EU involvement in such legislative concerns.

I believe that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade block in order to sign trade agreements. Iceland, for instance, has now suspended its application for EU membership which in our view is a wise decision.

My party has made it very clear from the outset that we oppose all aspects of this Directive. No-one can dispute that smoking is a major health issue that affects the whole of Europe. Indeed we have all seen the statistics – that over 700 000 people a year in Europe die of smoking. However shocking this figure is, though, it is ultimately these people’s right to smoke – and the EU certainly does not have the right to try and stop them. Ironically, the measures outlined in the Directive are flawed on so many levels that they are unlikely to stop people smoking anyway. Banning smalls packs will simply make people buy more cigarettes. Banning menthol and other flavoured cigarettes will simply increase the cigarette black market. Demanding that large health warnings be put on cigarette packs will make counterfeiting easier, fuelling the black market yet further. Once again, the EU has failed to see the wood for the trees here and, as a result, this Directive is not only misinformed and unfounded but entirely unfit for purpose. John Bufton  (EFD

I voted against the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement on a Civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) between the European Community and its Member States and Ukraine for two reasons: firstly, because I believe that the British Government alone should have the right to conclude international agreements which affect the UK and secondly, because in my opinion the GNSS is a huge waste of money which is not proving to be operational and to the benefit of UK citizens.

Against. My Party is completely against the idea of engaging in any military action in Syria. This is largely because we do not believe that firing cruise missiles into the region will make the situation any more stable – nor will it help the suffering people of Syria.

I must laud the Commission Presidentʼs attempt to put a positive spin on the current State of the Union, however, I quite simply fail to buy into his over optimistic and ideological view. And I am sure I am not the only one. Europe is, in reality, nowhere near an economic recovery – fragile or otherwise. And this incessant pursuit of forming a Europe-wide banking union is unlikely to aid recovery. It is, if anything, more likely to lead Europe into an even deeper financial mess. Similarly, his suggestion that we continue to work in the same way to alleviate unemployment levels in the EU is simply absurd. One look at the figures tells us that the schemes and systems implemented to date have been ineffective – and yet he insists on forcing the Member States to continue down this road to ruin. To end on a positive note, although it is unusual for the Commission President to express opinions about the internal political situation in a Member State, I welcome his acknowledgement that UKIP is fast becoming a real fighting force in UK politics. The real brand of euro-scepticism that our party offers is finally receiving the recognition it deserves. John Bufton  (EFD

As a responsible politician and an accountant it is impossible for me to approve this discharge Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the discharge of the Railway Agency in particular because of the wastefulness of its two headquarters in Lille and Valenciennes, two cities that are 50 kilometres apart.

 Mr President, when I was European Commission Chief Accountant back in 2002, I pointed out huge flaws in the accounting systems. Today it is still just as bad – or even worse – than it was back then. Yet MEPs will grant discharge to the budget, despite a hole of EUR[nbsp ]6.2 billion in the accounts. It is now clear to me that the discharge procedure is a pantomime. There is no longer proper scrutiny or any holding to account for taxpayers’ money by MEPs. What an anomaly! Those who approve the budget are the same voices asking for budget increases, year after year, for the same Member States they blame for the irregularities. We should instead be cutting the EU budget by a minimum of the same level of the error. In May, taxpayers should call to account all the MEPs who approve of this ludicrous situation. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 Madam President, it is that time of the year again when we put forward our wishes regarding what the EU budget should be spent on. Headlines like ‘investing in research and innovation’, ‘strengthening EU industry’ or ‘job creation’ are repeated year after year. We are supposed to have been investing in those areas for the last decade. It has made no difference, as the crisis has demonstrated, and yet the Commission keeps asking for more money. This is in spite of the fact that the auditors say that the level of irregularities has increased. As I see it, the Commission has totally failed to demonstrate any efficiency in controlling taxpayers’ money. Would anybody in their right mind invest in such a badly-run organisation? The answer would certainly be no. So why do we keep asking for more money from taxpayers? It is this Parliament’s role to call the Commission to account and say ‘no’ to business as usual.

 I voted against the Karas/Hoang Ngoc report on the role and operations of the Troika with regard to the euro area programme countries because it wants to create an EU European monetary fund which I would consider to be a disaster for the taxpayers of the Member States. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the Gardiazabal Rubial report on the General guidelines for the 2015 budget – Section III. The guidelines as always seek to increase the EU budget and turn a blind eye to the continuing high level of irregularities in the budget. In 2012 these were 4.8% of the budget. In addition the Court of Auditors has not approved the EU books for the nineteenth consecutive year. The EU budget exists to make the EU relevant to the citizens of Member States but in the light of the EU’s continuing role in the financial crisis, even it is not enough to make the citizens want to continue with the project.

 I voted against the Iacolino report on the European Public Prosecutorʼs Office (EPPO) because while I fully support the fight against fraud in the EUʼs budget, the establishment of the EPPO would fundamentally encroach upon the sovereignty of national criminal justice systems.

 I voted against the Daerden report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Comunidad Valenciana textiles.

 I voted against the Zuber report on equality between women and men in the European Union because, yet again, European federalists are using the natural human instinct of fairness to extend the EU’s remit into areas where the European Union has not been given competence.

 I voted for the Casini report Amending Rules 166 (final vote) and 195(3) (voting in committee) of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. This report changed the Parliament’s rules on final votes in plenary and in committee roll-calls.

 I voted against the Costello Report on the Fund for European aid to the most deprived. Our government strongly supports measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion. But it does not believe that the Fund for European aid to the most deprived will be an effective way of doing this. We were one of a number of Member States which argued that this was an area of national competence and we have not participated in the previous food-bank schemes since the mid-1990s. Both Houses of Parliament have adopted Reasoned Opinions stating that the Commissionʼs proposal is inconsistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the De Backer Report on the European Semester. While the report is in the main part acceptable and supports Conservative priorities such as structural reforms, tax simplification and a stronger single market in services, there are too many concessions made to the Left.

 I voted against this report because it fails in its stated aims. Decreasing the length of delay after which compensation can be claimed from five to three hours would incentivise airlines to cancel flights in order to maintain their schedule and minimise compensation. Secondly, it would put a disproportionate burden on feeder flights. If adopted, these proposals would lead to a reduction in services (particularly from the regions) and would threaten ‘inter-lining’, thus increasing journey times and requiring passengers to check baggage in and out for ‘connecting flights’. In addition, the proposals would not remove a clause suspending the application of air-passenger-rights legislation to Gibraltar. In 2006, the UK, Spain and the Government of Gibraltar concluded the ‘Cordoba Agreement’ to ensure that Gibraltar Airport was part of the EU’s single market. I share the UK Government’s strong view that Gibraltar is an EU airport and that, in line with the Treaties, all EU aviation measures must be extended to Gibraltar. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against this report because our energy market must be free from the burden of expensive renewable energy quotas. I cannot support this joint committee report calling for the continuation of the 2020 binding targets on emissions reduction and renewables, as well as a mandatory target for energy efficiency.

We cannot afford to continue to make the same mistakes that have pushed our energy costs to such a high level. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted for the oral question on female genital mutilation (FGM), asking the Commission about its intentions to propose a strategy and action plan aimed at addressing FGM. Although I do not want to see an EU legislative instrument, I would like to see more coherent policy, detailing how Member States can tackle this brutality. In particular, I would like to see Member States pursuing, prosecuting and punishing any EU resident who has carried out FGM, and I would like to see them recognise that FGM is a gross form of violence against women and violence against the child. (According to the World Health Organisation, the majority of cases of FGM have involved young girls between infancy and the age of 15.) Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 The EMPL and ECON committees wanted to initiate consultation with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) on the subject of the structure and organisation of social dialogue in the context of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

 This agreement with the Swiss competition authorities is largely straightforward and reflects the high level of integration between the EU and Swiss economies.

 This report addresses perceived difficulties caused by differing rules and requirements across the Member States relating to official documents such as birth certificates and residency permits. Presently most Member States require documents to be authenticated, either through legalisation or apostille procedures, where documents have been issued in another country, including other Member States. However, the rapporteur has chosen to increase significantly the scope of the legislation, whilst Tory amendments to introduce greater safeguards against fraud and forgery were rejected. As a consequence I voted against this proposal. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 This directive updates the 2003 Market Abuse Directive by introducing maximum jail sentences of at least four years for market abuse, such as insider dealing, market manipulation and unlawful disclosure of information. It complements the regulation adopted last year which imposed large fines on companies involved in such practices. It should be noted that while the UK already imposes more severe criminal sanctions than required by the proposal, it has an opt-out on this legislation under Protocol 21. Nevertheless, as many Member States have hitherto imposed less severe penalties in this area, I voted in favour of the report to reduce the number of cases of market abusers taking advantage of lax jurisdictions.

 This regulation has been resubmitted to Parliament due to an incorrect legal basis being used in the original proposal. A notification mechanism will be put in place for Member States to provide the Commission with certain data and information regarding investment projects in energy infrastructure that concern the production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas and electricity. I voted in favour of this report as it will help to build a better understanding of the EU’s energy infrastructure, which will be particularly important when reviewing and planning energy security policies.

 Part of this report is dedicated to the procedure on the appointment of the Court of Auditors’ members and consultation with Parliament. It is stressed that some appointments to the Court have given rise to differences between Parliament and the Council, and it is considered unacceptable that the Council appoints members to the Court of Auditors despite Parliament’s unfavourable opinion. Here, I support the current application of Article 286 TFEU, whereby the Council has the right to adopt candidates for the Court of Auditors after consulting the European Parliament. I defend the Council’s right to override a negative opinion by the European Parliament. Consequently I voted against this report. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I am concerned that this report goes way beyond the competence of REGI and deals with questions that ought to fall within the sole competence of ITRE. Moreover, as Parliament has already adopted reports on the role of cohesion policy in implementing EU energy policy and on the implementation of energy efficiency measures under cohesion policy, this report is unnecessary and unhelpful. Beyond this question of competence, the report calls for ambitious strategies and policies for dealing with CO2
 emissions – in particular, the call for further ambitious binding energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. I am firmly opposed to the setting of any such ambitious targets which prioritise renewable energies over other low-carbon alternatives. Moreover, I am strongly opposed to the earmarking of 20 % of ERDF funding in the recent 2014-2020 Common Provisions Regulation for strategies to develop a low-carbon economy. The report is overwhelmingly prescriptive concerning this point. It is for these reasons that I voted against it. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted for the Tarabella Report on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.

I voted against the Caspary Report on access of third-country goods and services to the Unionʼs internal market in public procurement and procedures supporting negotiations on access of Union goods and services to the public procurement markets of third countries. My vote was against the proposed regulation because it could lead to a net reduction in market access and could diminish growth potential at a time when it is needed most. This is the position of a majority of the Member States in the Council. There are significant risks in deploying the proposed instrument as a leveraging tool in trade negotiations as it could leave the EU open to damaging retaliatory measures, losing out on growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets.

I voted for the Macovei Report on the Hercule III programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the European Unionʼs financial interests because the new programme continues to place specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, which are estimated to cost Member States EUR 11 billion per annum. The programme reflects the Commissionʼs legal obligations stemming from agreements with four international tobacco manufacturers. Even though questions do remain regarding the effectiveness of such programmes, in this case efforts must be made to manage the administrative costs of the programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, there is no doubt that smuggling and the counterfeiting of cigarettes are matters of serious concern for us all. The large sums of money lost, which should be going to exchequers across the EU, are significant, and this means that front-line services are not being as well supported as they should be. But let us be honest: the amounts of taxpayers’ money wasted by the EU institutions are also significant. Some 4.8 % of the EU budget in 2012 was spent on regional projects which should never have received the money – a total of EUR 5.5 billion. Only in December did we learn that billions in aid to Gaza and Egypt cannot be properly accounted for, having been spent on out-of-work politicians. And almost every month we receive a new Court of Auditors’ report spelling out more errors and more wasted money. If MEPs are serious about looking after EU financial interests, they should look closer to home as well as to the Hercule III programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Kadenbach report on ‘Eco-innovation - jobs and growth through environmental policyʼ because I believe that what is really needed is to focus on the implementation of existing legislation before proposing fresh regulations.

I voted against the Harkin report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund 2014-2020 because, while it is purportedly designed to show solidarity towards workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, it is not an efficient and systematic instrument to reduce the impact of the economic crisis. It has never functioned properly, it has lived too long already and should be shut down, not extended. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted for the Mitchell report on resilience and disaster-risk reduction (DRR) in developing countries because it focuses on actions to help the most vulnerable, poorest and marginalised populations, which are the most exposed to risks, while on a broader scale targeting fragile and crisis-prone countries.

I voted against the Gardini report on a civil protection mechanism because the budget for the civil protection mechanism will almost double in the next seven years from EUR 189 million to EUR 326.6 million, which I consider unacceptable.

Mr President, this report represents a broken promise. The Commission assured us that they would get errors under control. Instead, they are on the rise again: up from 3.9% in 2011 to 4.8% in 2012. That is over EUR 6 billion of taxpayers’ money that cannot be properly accounted for. Like the vast majority of the public I am disgusted that the Commission is paying lip service to getting their finances in order. However, what really bothers my patience in this House is the ‘business as usual’ mentality, where irregularities are tolerated despite the huge amounts of money involved. The Commission just gets a polite slap on the wrist. In any private enterprise, if almost 5% of the budget was in error, heads would roll and the shareholders would quite rightly demand change at the top. Instead, this Parliament, which blames the Member States for irregularities, is happy to ask for a bigger EU budget, to give to those same Member States. What a contradiction! Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Koppa report on the implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy (based on the Annual Report from the Council to the Union Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy). The report wants greater harmonisation of EU defence policy, pooling of Member States’ budgets to fund military operations – including expanded common costs of EU battlegroups – and permanent structured cooperation. My party has consistently argued for improved EU coordination with NATO rather than the establishment of new EU strategies and expensive institutions within the CSDP framework.

I voted against the budget of the European Union for 2014 because this is taxpayer money that lacks control. Every year there is evidence of gross mismanagement and even fraud, to the point where the books of the Commission have not been signed off by the Auditors for 19 years. The report of the Court of Auditors for 2012 has the level of ‘irregularities’ up to 4.8%. No responsible person can vote for this. In addition, the United Kingdom is a net contributor that has little say over what the money is spent on. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the La Via report on DAB 9/2013. I do not support the method chosen of financing the fund. EUR 519 million was available at the end of 2013 through the ‘global transfer’, a mopping-up procedure that is executed in every budgetary year to reallocate unused funds in the budget, and the ECR believes that the DAB 9/2013 would have been better financed using money from this procedure rather than placing EUR 150m in the budget for 2014.

I voted in favour of the De Haene-Kalfin report on the MFF because it is in fact the first time that a reduction in the multiannual budget has taken place. This is in large measure due to the tough position the leader of my party, Mr Cameron, took in the Council negotiations on the MFF last year.

 Mr President, during my time as an MEP, this House has come every year, without exception, with a request to increase the EU budget and this, regardless of the current crisis and the austerity measures. Every year too, without fail, the Auditors have refused to approve the management of those EU funds. The problem is one of failure: failure to control that the taxpayers’ money is properly spent. As recently as July, the Court of Auditors reported EUR 3 billion of waste in road construction projects. This audit only covered four countries so I fear that the overall figure across the EU would be much higher. If we did a proper job we would not need to engage in a multi-million information campaign ahead of the 2014 elections. EU taxpayers do not trust us because we do not look after their interests; we should stop putting more money into this black hole. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, at long last the saga that was the negotiation of the EU long-term budget, the MFF, has concluded. This House backed away from the frankly ridiculous EUR 1 trillion that it had been asking. We agree that EUR 960 billion is still a massive figure but it represents, for the first time since multiannual budgeting began in 1993, a reduction in the EU budget. This is something that, as you will know, I have been asking for since I first became an MEP. But the public will not be rejoicing. They know that the MFF is still full of vanity projects such as Galileo and the ineffective European External Action Service, headed by Catherine Ashton. While today is a step in the right direction, I fear that Parliament will, as in previous years, return like Oliver Twist to ask for more money. I hope flexibility does not mean a blank cheque book. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, if anyone needed evidence of how inefficient the EU institutions are, then the seven years it has taken to finalise a revision of the OLAF regulatory framework is surely proof enough. It seems that even when agreement has been reached among institutions there is need for further amendments.  However, the most important issue here today is the independence of OLAF, which this framework actually fails to put right. The Anti-Fraud Office is primarily aimed at avoiding fraud and corruption affecting EU funds. It should there be, by its very definition, independent of the institutions involved in handling those funds – notably the European Commission, but also the European Parliament and the European Council. OLAF should report directly, without EU intermediaries, to the European citizens who fund the EU budget, and its regulation must not be subject to any politics. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, no one denies that well-funded companies and wealthy investors may be trying to avoid tax. The tax avoiders are mostly in Europe, America or other developed countries. However, when we talk about tax havens, they are mostly in small jurisdictions outside of those countries. This report is really a request for the EU to start controlling tax policy over which it has no competence. Tax is the competence of national governments in the EU and elsewhere. The truth is that clamping down on tax havens requires agreement between all the governments involved; otherwise, it is a pointless exercise. In any case we already have the OECD’s Financial Action Task Force working on this. Europe just wants to get its hands on what is at present a sovereign matter for the nations of Europe. One cannot help thinking that this is exactly what they wanted in the first place. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, once again we are being asked whether or not we approve the management of EU funds by the European Commission. The Court of Auditors has, for the 18th year in a row, refused to clear the EU budget, but this has never led this Parliament to actually act. When the auditors talk about significant material errors, breach of public procurement rules, claims for non-existent animals and incorrect activation of entitlements, they are actually describing the way in which European taxpayers’ money is being misappropriated. The level of irregularities has actually gone up to almost 4%, so the question here is: when is the European Commission actually going to be held to account for this abominable failure? Because whatever blame we want to put on the beneficiaries, it is actually the Commission which asks for our taxes to fund the budgets and which should therefore ensure they are properly spent before releasing them. I am not holding my breath. This Parliament will vote to approve the EU accounts once again. However, the UK and the Netherlands have refused to approve them and I hope many more Member States will follow suit. Marta Andreasenon,  
on behalf of the ECR Group

 Mr President, this House should be the first to lead by example and cut our own costs in line with the austerity measures being imposed around Europe. While I recognise that Parliament’s administration has made an effort to achieve some reductions, there are still many areas where more could and should be done. The most obvious is the ‘three seat’ cost of Parliament. Why not cut out this complex arrangement, for which taxpayers pay more than EUR 250 million per year? The proposed budget includes another significant increase for European political parties – an expenditure line which will have grown by 50% in the last couple of years. What is the purpose of this increase if there will not be a European constituency in the coming elections and Members will be elected from national lists? Projects like the European House of History or the Parliamentarium also continue to absorb more taxpayers’ money. All these costs will not increase the visibility or the credibility of this institution. It is only the hard work and the integrity of the Members which will convince citizens of the importance of this institution. If we continue to ignore this reality we should not be surprised when few turn out to vote in the next European elections. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, since I became an MEP I have been fighting for a reduction in the EU budget. The economic growth promised by the Lisbon Agenda and financed by the current long-term budget has instead brought economic stagnation. I fully support the deal negotiated by the British Prime Minister at the European Council. It represents the first cut in the EU budget since 1993. I have therefore voted in favour of my group’s MFF resolution which endorses the agreement reached by the prime ministers of the 27 Member States early in February 2013. Like other political groups, the ECR emphasises the need to spend more efficiently, rather than simply spend more. It enshrines sound financial management as the guiding principle of the EU budget. I regard the rejection of the Council agreement by the other groups as a slap in the face of European taxpayers. We should lead by example and share the austerity burden; instead the European Parliament has shown its gluttony. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, I find it ludicrous that this House is trying to push ahead on the negotiation of the 2014 budget, on the one hand, while on the other it refuses to back the agreement made by Heads of State on the seven-year budget starting next year. On top of this, the guidelines on the 2014 budget refer to extra payments that need to be covered for past and current years, with the amounts remaining totally unclear. The Commission and Parliament insist on using the word ‘deficit’, whereas this concept does not apply to the EU budget, as revenues are raised from Member States to cover the agreed budget. It is time for Parliament and the Council to call on the Commission to assume its responsibility on the budget and its implementation by providing reliable accounting information as to where and when EU taxpayers’ money is being spent. I am not therefore in a position to vote in favour of the Jensen report. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, the Multiannual Financial Framework has not actually been decided so this debate on 2014 budget guidelines appears to be premature. That aside, and given the economic situation of Europe, I believe it is now time to perform a cost-benefit analysis in regard to the whole of the EU budget. That cost-benefit analysis should start with all the mini-institutions that have been growing like mushrooms in the last decade.  Take for example the EEAS, the European External Action Service. What is the benefit that this institution brings to European citizens? Baroness Ashton has said that it will not replace national embassies. Great! So why do we need it? And the Committee of the Regions, has it actually helped regions develop their economies. No, it does not seem so. If the EU really wanted to help Member States and taxpayers, it would simply abandon budget lines that have no added value – but this will not happen. We will only continue to spend our time trying to window-dress little cuts here and there. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, I must admit that my curiosity was raised by this report. Contrary to its normal strategy of centralising and seizing control as much as possible, the EU is now proposing that banks and investment firms assess for themselves the credit risk of entities or instruments in which they invest, and is asking them not to rely on external ratings. The report even proposes to take ratings out of the Financial Regulation and eliminate risk-weighting of assets through external rating or internal models.  How this would contribute to making the evaluation of risk independent or avoid conflicts of interests, is really a mystery to me. Whether we like it or not, these agencies provide an independent view, and the fact that some would find that they have become too powerful is no basis for them being muscled out in such a way. It is as if the EU wants to remove any analytical road blocks that stand in its way. I wonder why. In response to Mrs Lulling, I would like to say yes, the UK should leave the EU. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Mr President, the negotiation of the annual EU budget has become a farce. Last year Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed up to an increase of just over 2 % for 2012. Yet last October the Commission was asking for no less than EUR 9 billion of extra cash and this House has joined the cry for more money. This is a 9 % increase, not a 2 % increase.  Of course last year’s agreement allowed for an increase in the legal obligations the EU could enter into, the so-called commitments. But this fact seemed to go unnoticed by the Heads of State. The fact is that we face the same situation for 2013, as the legal obligations are now growing by up to EUR 151 billion and who picks up the tab? The taxpayers. Frontline services are being cut in Member States while the EU gets on with its own wasteful agenda.  Mr Cameron, please do not come back claiming victory this time. It would be a serious insult to your people.  (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I think that this is not the main issue. The main issue is where we are spending money. You are now running a political campaign against Mr Farage, but that is up to you. I can tell you that I have been involved in the fisheries reform. I presented to this Parliament a report on what the Auditors have said about the common fisheries policy and all of you voted against my report. I do not think you are very concerned about the common fisheries policy at all. Why should Mr Farage be so concerned? Marta Andreasen,

Mr President, it is no surprise that only ten Member States at most are willing to adopt a financial transaction tax. The majority of states know that this tax would only push the financial sector out of Europe, to the further detriment of their economies. Insisting on forcing this tax through by means of enhanced cooperation will only make it more evident that it is the wrong way to go. The ill-fated Swedish initiative back in the 1980s should be seen as a good reason for not proceeding. In addition, there are two aspects of the proposal that have not been laid out in clear terms and which are a matter of concern. The first and most important one is how it will affect non-participating Member States – because it will, notably in the case of cross-border transactions. The second one is how this FTT will be spent.  Regardless, I hope that the British Prime Minister will protect the City from any implications of this tax. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, this is now shamefully the 18th year in a row that the auditors cannot clear the EU budget. Worse, 50 % of the samples taken by the auditors show irregularities. The excuses the Commission puts forward are always the same: it is the fault of the Member States: they commit the irregularities. But taxpayers entrust their monies to the European Commission, which abjectly fails to perform essential controls before it hands the cash over to the Member States. This House is also to blame by continually rubber-stamping the EU budget on the basis that ‘error’ does not necessarily mean ‘fraud’. Well, if a farmer gets money for the welfare of his 150 sheep and the auditors find that he does not have any, in the real world this would be considered fraud. The point is that if the Commission refuses to take responsibility for taxpayers’ money and blames Member States, why does it ask for more money to fund those same Member States? This is yet another reason why the EU budget should be cut. What are we waiting for? Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, what has happened with EU budget investment in the last seven years? Well, we all know where we stand today. Budgeting is not a field where the EU can claim success. Why are we putting more money into agricultural funding that amounts, at present, to over 40 % of the budget? We are paying for farmers not to grow food, although the market is there. Have the billions paid out in structural funds to countries like Greece, Portugal or Spain stemmed the crisis there? No, they have not. If there was a serious will to use the budget to develop Europe’s economy, a major rethink would have taken place many years ago. Instead, every year we are asked to top up the same old budget lines. The EU budget for the 2014-2020 period should be reduced drastically to allow Member States to decide where they want to put their taxpayers’ money. The UK should not only veto an increase, but should demand a significant reduction. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is no secret to anybody that the conciliation for 2013 failed before it even started. This was due to the fact that the Commission came up with a request for EUR 9 billion more to cover this year’s payments. I have been deeply sceptical about the need for this extra cash. Most Member States cannot afford cofinancing in these times of crisis. We need to remember that in February this year, two months after the close of the 2011 accounts, the Budget Commissioner told us that there was a shortfall of EUR 11 billion. Then in April, two months later, he told us there was a EUR 1.5 billion surplus. Then, at the conciliation last week, Mr Lewandowski came up with a reduction on payment needs for 2012 of EUR 1.5 billion. So which number should we believe now? This behaviour has seriously affected the credibility of the negotiators, notably the Commission. No more money should be granted to the Commission as long as it fails to produce reliable and precise information. I have been saying this for many years now.

– The only compromise that the Council and the Member States assumed was the number that was agreed upon last December for the 2012 budget. The fact that the Council said that they would put in more money if it was needed refers to unexpected events, such as the flooding in Italy. However, coming up with EUR 9 billion, which is almost 7 % of the budget for 2012, is really unacceptable and shows that there is no accounting that can be relied upon in the Commission.

– I believe, Mr Garriga Polledo, that we should have proof that the projects have effectively been run. For me, that would be the evidence that we need the money. I am sorry to say this, but we do not have a need popping up from one day to the next which justifies the EUR 9 billion. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteur, we should call this report what it really is: a cry for help by the European Parliament to remain relevant. The lesson still has not been learnt. We find ourselves in the current financial mess in large part due to the inefficiency of the European institutions. Angela Merkel recognised this by deciding to act intergovernmentally instead of interinstitutionally, during all the peaks of the crisis. Now we are being asked to empower the same institutions to be the supervisors of this new European Monetary Union, which will also result in an additional burden to taxpayers. In a nutshell, this will entail more staff and even more money and will further remove powers from national supervisors, while the main problems remain unresolved. The EU needs to learn to do much less and do it better. More Europe simply makes a deep hole much deeper. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, Erasmus started 25 years ago, and three million people have taken part. During the period 2007-2013 the EU has paid out grants worth EUR 3 billion on Erasmus. However, the economy has shrunk and youth unemployment has grown massively to 11.7 %. Furthermore, the grant gives an average EUR 300 per month, which is insufficient to cover the basic costs of living. If we add travel costs to this we can estimate that a family needs to pay at least EUR 5 000 per year on top of the grant to cover the total cost of one of its members doing Erasmus. How many families can afford this in these times of crisis? Considering the lack of impact on employment and economic growth that the Erasmus programme has had over the last decade, and given that it can only be afforded by those that are well off, we should scrap it. There are many other priorities that need more urgent attention. Those who find it indispensable to have this development should pay out of their own pocket instead of imposing the burden on the taxpayer. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Mr President, whether it agrees or not, the European Commission has contributed to the crisis by distributing the European budget without exercising proper controls. Also, through multiple directives, it has imposed a huge burden of regulation on Member States, forcing prohibitive costs on private entrepreneurship. How can the same institution which has failed so gravely make judgments on where and how Member States need to put their taxpayers’ money? SMEs are the backbone of economic expansion and recovery. But by urging the Member States to create access to finance for SMEs, we will achieve nothing, as their coffers are now empty. Why not use the bank bailout money to help SMEs instead of helping failed banks? Why not look for more flexible measures instead of calling for the inclusion of a core set of rights in workers’ contracts? The Commission has not learnt any lessons from the past. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this House is stretching the meaning of the word ‘investment’ beyond elasticity. Can any MEP claim that the many billion euros of taxpayers’ money spent on the Lisbon Agenda have delivered any return? Let us look at the evidence. In 2007, EU unemployment was 7.3 %; today it stands at 10.5 %. In Spain, one of the biggest recipients of cohesion funding over recent years, the jobless figure today sits at 25 %. GDP for the European Union has been flat. We should also not forget that the Court of Auditors has not given EU spending an overall clean bill of health for over a decade. The MFF has been built around a legacy of failed projects, and the 2014-2020 MFF simply seeks to top up those failed projects. Employment comes from new industry and new industry requires capital, flexibility and less red tape – none of which the European Union helps with. The MFF needs a haircut and not a Financial Transaction Tax to pay for more waste. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I supported Amendment 1263 on the House of European History because it reduces the budget of the European Parliament by 5.3 million; even though I believe it does not go far enough, it is a reduction. Ideally the vanity project should be wound up and the budget line removed. I voted for Amendment 964 on ITER because I am in favour of reducing the European Union budget, and Amendment 964 was to reduce payments by EUR 490 million. However, I do not support the intent of the author of the amendment which was to eliminate nuclear power. I fully support nuclear power and, if the British people were not sending so much money to Brussels more would be available for investment in the British nuclear industry. I supported Amendment 754 because I oppose EU funds, which are really the taxes of British and European citizens, being used for aid to tobacco producers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Mr President, a 7 % increase for 2013 is outrageous. Does anybody in this House seriously believe that we will help recovery by funding space projects? Why is Galileo still getting EUR 160 million, almost three times more than last year? This is a badly-managed project producing technology that rivals already brought to the market years ago. Why are projects like the Earth monitoring programme and the space research programme getting over EUR 300 million? I can assure you that none of these vanity projects will be putting food on the tables of Europe’s growing number of increasingly angry poor people. Then we have the famous supervisory bodies created a couple of years ago to avoid any more financial scandals. They have not done so. Their reward is EUR 20 million. Would Europe fall apart if all these projects were not funded, along with the EEAS, worth EUR 430 million? Absolutely not. Forget a rise, President; forget a freeze, Mr Cameron. What this ridiculous budget really needs is a cut of at least 10 %. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and legislative resolution because I believe the common fisheries policy cannot be reformed, least of all by its authors (the Commission).

– I voted against the Färm report because my experience with the management and supervision of European funding is not good. Regional funds which require cofinancing are poorly controlled, with responsibility being shirked by the Commission which is ultimately in charge. Project bonds should be a good means to get private funding for these infrastructure projects, but alas, with the EU managing them, I anticipate poor control and indifferent results. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

in writing. 
– I voted against draft amending budget number 3/2012, the Balzani report, because my party’s policy is to return unused European funds to the Member States and not to put them aside for future use by the European Union. Member States are having difficult budgets at present and are cutting across the board, even frontline services. At times such as these, there is no excuse for these funds being diverted for the questionable projects of the EU. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, here we go again. In the worst financial crisis in living memory, this House comes up with more unrealistic and irresponsible demands. It simply beggars belief that a majority here can even dare to ask for a 6.8% increase. The idea that genuine growth and employment can be delivered by the EU budget is simply ridiculous. Hundreds of billions have been spent to date that have added up to precisely nothing in terms of growth. Many believe, as I do, that the EU and its policies are, to a large extent, responsible for this crisis. The Commission, in particular, has failed to control the use of EU funding entrusted to it by the taxpayers, while targeting the funds towards supporting its own heavy regulation and the EU project as a whole. Now this House wants to reward this failure with an increase. If you are listening, Mr Cameron, I have a straight-talking message for you: continue to send money to Brussels and you are effectively transferring power to an unelected, irresponsible and hugely wasteful bureaucracy. For goodness sake, give the British people a break and cut our contribution to the EU budget. I am calling for a reduction, not for a freeze. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– Mr President, an astronomical amount of taxpayers’ money has been given to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain by the EU since 2010: EUR 285 billion. You heard me correctly – EUR 285 billion! What has happened to this money? The EU’s failure to keep tabs on funding means that nobody can know for sure. Now, more money is wanted to waste on promoting deeper European integration. The Lisbon Agenda was a disaster. Can anyone here say that Europe is the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world? Only if they are an ostrich. Now the EU wants to pour billions more into the 2020 plan. The new own resources being proposed, namely the financial transaction tax, mean that this money will be even more unaccountable. This House, in approving this framework, is voting for a continuation of the last ten wasteful years. I shudder at that thought. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, Ms Gomes is wrong. She is talking about something different. The EUR 285 billion is the EU budget that was paid into these Member States. This money is not to be returned and it does not earn any interest. Ms Gomes, you are confused. I am not talking about the bailout. I am talking about the EU budget that was supposed to grow the economies of the countries concerned and did not grow those economies. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, these proposals are a classic case of too little and too late. Greece is under the water and Ireland and Portugal are not far behind. But now Spain, a far larger economy, is having to bail out its own banks. Why should private debt be turned into public debt? Whether the money comes from the EU or from national treasuries, the story remains the same. The people who are now suffering from severe belt-tightening will be the ones who end up paying for the wrong decisions made by private companies. What this Parliament should be demanding is a serious investigation into Spain’s banks, notably Bankia, to understand how a hole of EUR 20 billion could suddenly emerge. Bailing out such banks without investigating how and where the money has gone is an act of irresponsibility and contempt towards European citizens. Enough is enough. We need to call time on this approach. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, we are about to allow the EU to finance itself directly from taxpayers’ pockets without negotiations with anybody, not even the Council. We cannot think that giving the EU tax-raising powers without normal democratic scrutiny is acceptable. It is not. In addition, the legal argument on which this House is trying to base the establishment of an FTT is incorrect. The different sizes of the financial industry in some Member States are not an indication of distorted competition, but rather due to historic developmental differences. This should never have been interpreted as a reason for tax harmonisation. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to tax both sides of the transaction. If one of the parties is not a signatory to the treaty, then the other party would have to raise both amounts. What would then happen to the UK veto? It would be useless. The UK taxpayer would end up paying the tax on all transactions that involved Member States who have signed the treaty. However, it would not enjoy a reduction in its EU contribution as it has not signed up to this treaty. Of course, this House and the Commission must know that as long as the FTT does not become a global tax, the financial sector could move to other, more tax-friendly locations. But they feel the EU can afford the loss of this very important industry. It cannot. (The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– Firstly, you would have to prove to me that, in fact, there has not been any relocation away from these countries. I am not sure. I do not have any proof. On the other hand, maybe these countries do not have a similar tax to finance their own budgets. The UK has a stamp duty which it will need to use to finance its own budget. Once this FTT is imposed on the UK, I do not know how the UK is going to finance its budget. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, the procedure whereby we in this House approve the use of the EU budget by the Commission and the other institutions is our greatest responsibility as representatives of the citizens of the Member States. Yet, year after year, while the Court of Auditors fails to give the EU spending a clean bill of health, this House is happy to approve the management’s performance. The auditors’ report for the year 2010 reveals that the error rate – a fine name for the irregular use of funds – has grown from 3.3% to 3.7%. They add that 50% of the transactions sampled were affected by errors. How can we tell taxpayers that their money has been properly spent when we have this situation? Worse, how can we ask taxpayers to put even more into policy areas such as cohesion, energy and transport, where the error rate has increased to an astonishing 7.7%? The increase in the number of agencies from three to 24 in a decade is a matter of concern. The Commission seems to have little control over them, which means that, in the discharge reports, one sees the same stories again and again: conflicts of interest and a revolving door to outside employers at least as efficient as the ones in this building. Yet while this House is prepared to turn a blind eye to the deficiencies of those responsible for most of the budget, including itself, it puts great energy into refusing to approve the management of the Council’s budget. It is not that I want to defend the Council, but this is merely playing politics – and that, in essence, is what the discharge procedure has become, a political game. So, dear taxpayers, nobody actually cares how your money is spent. The solution? Stop sending money to Brussels! Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I am in favour of fusion energy; however, having the EU involved is not the way to achieve it. I voted against the Balzani report on the Draft amending budget no 1 of 2012 because it contributes to the continuation of wasting large amounts of money for a huge, controversial project with a slipping deadline and escalating costs that may never achieve its aim. The ITER agreement was signed in 2006 for a total of EUR 10 billion. It is now already going to cost EUR 15 billion and this figure will probably increase. There is little accountability to taxpayers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I am not against fusion energy. However, when it comes to ITER, the European Commission should have learned from its mistakes. Unfortunately this never happens. For example, the Galileo project was estimated to cost EUR 7 billion in the year 2000; by 2010 the estimated costs had tripled to EUR 22 billion. The cost continues to climb even further with no real end in sight. The parallels are alarming. ITER’s partners are saying they can only build a stripped-down version of the device by 2018, five years later than the date set in the original agreement. The first experiments intended to validate fusion for power will not take place until the end of 2025. Construction costs are likely to double from the original 2006 estimate of EUR 5 billion to EUR 10 billion. The cost of ITER’s operational phase – another EUR 5 billion over 20 years – may also rise. As 90% of the project is directly managed by the participating states, we are unlikely ever to know what the final costs will be. Taxpayers deserve to know the cost of ITER as they are ultimately paying for it, yet this House continues to approve the financing of a project that has already cost over 50% more than the original estimates. The EU’s approach to public finance is catastrophic. On Monday Commissioner Lewandowski told us that the 2011 payments budget was in surplus to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion, yet a couple of months ago he told us it was short to the amount of EUR 11 billion. Which version is true? Does he not know how much money he has in the bank at the end of each day? I know this and everybody knows this. ITER, like Galileo and the EU budget, is becoming an absurdity, but the taxpayers who are left to foot the bill for these projects are not laughing at all, I can assure you. We should scrap this project altogether. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, this Parliament should not be asking for more money from taxpayers, but less. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund a European History House or other narcissistic projects. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund expensive delegation trips to some paradise island. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund synthetic European political parties. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund communication and advertising campaigns to make itself known to the public. What this Parliament needs is to behave responsibly and act genuinely in the interests of the citizens of the Member States. In this sense, the first thing it should do is to stop burdening Europe’s people with heavy and useless regulation that frequently drives them out of business. The second thing it should do is take the lead in avoiding, condemning and sanctioning all wasteful and irregular use of taxpayers’ funds. I will vote against this budget proposal and urge the British Prime Minister to call for a 10% reduction in the EU budget for the European Parliament for 2013. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
–
 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we already know that billions in taxpayers’ money was wasted in financing the failed Lisbon Agenda, but the EU institutions will never admit their responsibility for helping to create this crisis. Instead, they are asking for more money from EU citizens to finance another failure to come: the 2020 Agenda. This is treating EU citizens as fools. When will this Parliament realise that stimulating growth and jobs requires much less red tape and much less pointless legislation? Why can this Parliament not admit that growth-targeted spending would be best directed at Member State level? Year after year, this Parliament is happy to put more taxpayers’ money in the hands of the Commission, an institution which – as the auditors tell us – is unable to ensure the proper use of EU funding. Of course, the Commission never runs a deficit, and it never will, because it can always go back to the Member States and tax them more to balance its books. If this House refuses to show common sense and responsibility, it will be the architect of its own downfall. I, for one, am calling on the British Government to reduce its contribution to the 2013 EU budget by 10% in comparison with this year’s contribution. However, when it comes to the UK coalition government, I will not be holding my breath. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in the middle of this crisis in which the EU is imposing cuts on Member States, this House still thinks it has the right to ask for inflationary increases. It cannot even agree on what the inflation percentage is but, whether it is 1.9% or 3%, the fact is that this EU bureaucracy is already bloated and needs to go on a hard diet. The cost of this Parliament, which has grown disproportionately, amounts to more than GBP 2 million per MEP. This is not value for money. Entertainment and representation costs have grown by 160% in the last four years. We should do away with this expenditure. The House of European History, with an initial cost estimated in excess of EUR 50 million, and with running costs of more than EUR 11 million per annum, is an extravagance at any time. We should be dropping the whole project. Funding for European political parties and foundations has grown 176% in the last four years. We do not need these European political parties. We MEPs are elected by our constituents or on national party lists. Prime Minister David Cameron is calling for a freeze, but what we need is a significant reduction in this Parliament’s budget and overall, in the whole budget of the European Union, at least a 10% decrease for next year. Without a cut, we are behaving like fat cats. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I voted against this resolution on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) because of economic, legal, environmental and moral reasons. The EU and Morocco concluded a FPA on 22 May 2006. An outside consultancy prepared an ex-post evaluation report, on behalf of the European Commission, which evaluates the first four years of the FPA with Morocco. On a general note, it states that ‘the results of this first four-year period of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco are generally rather disappointing’ as the agreement fails to stabilise the EU market and to develop the fisheries sector. Moreover, the population of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi people who suffer under the unlawful and unacceptable occupation of their country by Morocco, does not benefit from this agreement. Morocco has no right to dispose of the natural resources of a territory which does not fall under its sovereignty. For more than 30 years, the Western Sahara’s problem has been dealt with by the United Nations, but without any progress whatsoever. By rejecting the FPA, the European Parliament sent a strong signal to the Moroccan Government that the EU cannot support an agreement with a country which violates human rights. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the European Parliament and the Commission’s demand for a 5% increase for the 2012 budget was ridiculous, but the Council’s acceptance of a real 2% rise is a slap in the face for taxpayers in Europe. In a doomed pursuit of its Lisbon agenda, the EU has squandered more than one trillion euro of taxpayers’ money. I say the number again: one trillion euro. Funds are given to the Commission which fails to properly control their use, and yet it always comes back to us for more. The present economic and financial situation in Europe is, without a doubt, a reflection of the abject failure in the use of funds. While this wasteful spree goes on in Brussels, Mr Osborne in the UK has announced further budget cuts. So I tell the government in the UK today: no, Mr Hague, the EU budget is not under control; no, Mr Cameron, a 2% rise is not a freeze. For goodness sake, stop sending more British taxpayers’ money to the European Union. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, 31, 32, 33 to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, 25 years ago today I went to a football match along with thousands of Liverpool supporters. Ninety-six of us never came home. The fans were expectant, West Yorkshire Police were negligent. The fans died, the police lied. Justice for the 96: you’ll never walk alone. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, one of the three policy options being discussed as a means of addressing problems around the acquisition and preservation of pension rights is legislation at European Union level. Nothing would alarm my constituency in the West Midlands more than this. The use of best practices in a free and competitive market has always ensured the supremacy of the City of London in the financial services sector. Competition and innovation have ensured that British businesses have always led the way. As the workforce becomes more mobile, it is to innovators – not legislators – that we look to find the answers to the new challenges. Innovation creates; legislation stifles. In any case, the idea of having their pensions legislated by the same people who brought us the eurozone crisis would chill the hearts of most British people. My message to the European Commission is this, to parody an old saying: go and legislate on your own doorstep. Hands off our pensions! Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I commend Ms McIntyre for her efforts in this report and I share with her my desire for greater success for small and medium enterprises, and indeed their ability to create jobs. I think in the UK SMEs create up to about 43% of the workforce, the highest ratio. We differ, however, on how to go about it. She obviously believes that she can achieve this from inside the European Union, in what is probably one of her Conservative Party’s many hopes for reform. I feel this is unlikely. In 2009 when I attended, with Mr Bill Benyon, the Federation for Small Businesses (FSB) hustings in Birmingham, the FSB manifesto said, please, no more legislation from the European Union, please cut the red tape. Ms McIntyre, in the two and a half years you have been here you have failed to cut one piece of red tape. And indeed Mr Rübig, who submitted a question, talks about gold-plating. Well, the UK leads on gold-plating and this Conservative government has not done one thing to cut gold-plating. The Conservative government is losing us jobs in Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question
. –
 Mr President, my question is: with unemployment still a problem across Europe, and indeed in the UK, does Mr Farage think it is a fair use of taxpayers’ money – namely his secretarial allowance – not only to employ his wife Kirsten but also his former mistress, Annabelle Fuller? Is this a responsible use of taxpayers’ money, Mr Farage? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his honesty. As he points out, the EU institutions are responsible for the conditions of the economic adjustment programmes that are bringing hardship and despair to so many people. The EU was ill-prepared and ill-equipped to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. It is young people who are suffering the highest levels of unemployment; there is a decline in job quality and a deterioration in basic labour standards. However, it is not just Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus – the countries that have seen their economic governance fall under the control of the Troika – which are affected. My constituency, the West Midlands, has always been an industrial powerhouse, a centre of innovation and manufacturing excellence, but the eurozone crisis, burdensome EU red tape and the relocation of traditional industries to other EU Member States have left us in a situation where unemployment currently stands at 8.1[nbsp ]%, which is above the UK national average. Some 220[nbsp ]000 people in the region are unemployed. To you, that may be just a statistic, but to 220[nbsp ]000 of my constituents and their families – people with a traditionally strong work ethic – it is a tragedy. It spells frustration; it is a shame; it means young people leaving education but seeing no career, no prospects and no future. The Troika is addressing the symptoms of the crisis but we need to look at the cause. The eurozone is bringing us all down. The good news is that, through hard work and inward investment, the number of people unemployed in the West Midlands is falling. But perhaps the biggest boost to our economy will be when, following a referendum, we free ourselves from the economic basket-case that the EU is becoming. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is anathema to my constituents. It is promoted as a benefit of the EU, yet we see precious little of the money from the fund – which is, after all, UK taxpayers’ money – being returned to us, and when it does come it is much reduced and has strings attached. One ERDF-funded project is the Coventry Arena. In 2003 Coventry City Council received GBP[nbsp ]4.75[nbsp ]million from the fund. Last June I submitted a freedom-of-information request to the council seeking to ascertain the purpose of the grant. At the same time, I submitted an official question to the Commission seeking the same information. Imagine my surprise when the answers did not match. In fact, they could not be further apart. With other information that has come to my attention in the past year, and given Coventry City Council’s constant refusal to meet me about these discrepancies in funding, I can only conclude that they have something to hide. When the Commission sought clarification of the situation, the council changed its position. Today I can confirm that I am referring the matter to the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, so that it can investigate this use of taxpayers’ money. There is something rotten at the heart of Coventry City Council. Is there something fraudulent as well? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I represent the West Midlands in the United Kingdom where we have had terrible weather conditions. This has caused a tremendous amount of damage through floods, namely in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  At the last plenary here in Strasbourg, a Spanish MEP stood up and said he wanted more funds for Spain to deal with weather damage. That is all well and good, but Spain is already a net taker from the European Union. What about my constituents? What about the people in the West Midlands who do not get any of this emergency fund? I am concerned about them. I am concerned about the impact on their lives.  The UK pays GDP[nbsp ]52 million a day to the European Union. When do we get our share back? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, this is a procedural point of order. President Schulz and, I believe, the Conference of Presidents have made it clear that if you are on a speaking list, you cannot have a blue card. Ms in’t Veld was on the speaking list, and she has been given a blue card. Can you please explain this? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, since the Estrela report was voted on in the European Parliament, I have received more correspondence from constituents on this report than almost any other. It is of course a vital policy area that affects us all as individuals and as a society. It is also an area in which certain groups may be particularly vulnerable. This includes those in developing nations, the economically-disadvantaged and the poorly-informed or educated, and those women who live in societies in which women are treated unequally or even regarded simply as property. Through my work on the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, I have witnessed such situations at first hand. There are important debates to be had: access to contraception, sexual health, education and healthcare, and abortion are just some of the issues. It will also come as a surprise to learn that in several countries in the EU the age of consent is as low as fourteen. These debates must include all actors in society – not just politicians, but also healthcare professionals, teachers, parents and, given the moral implications, the Church. The Church should not be made an enemy. The Estrela report, however, appears to be dominated by a political agenda and in my opinion is unacceptable. That is why I could not support it, as I believe this to be a national competence. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, this is the first point of order: when an MEP asks for a procedural point of order, the President must give way. I think this is in the Rules of Procedure, and you failed to do that. I am actually calling for you to suspend this debate and put in place a chair who can competently take this debate. This has been absolute chaos. Your absolute bigoted bias in this debate has been absolutely disgraceful. Please vacate the chair and put someone else more competent in. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is poignant that Greece should take over the Presidency at this time. Greece is the living embodiment of the failure of the Troika and indeed the euro project. Mr Samaras, you talk about the mistakes of your country over decades. Surprisingly, you failed to put any blame where it truly belongs, namely on the pro-federalising Eurocrats who ignore the Maastricht convergence criteria to push on with their project of a federal Euro-state. Linking the Greek economy with such a powerhouse as Germany was utter madness, and your people paid the price – not least with a suicide rate that increased by 46 %. In your speech you stated that your first commitment was to ever-closer EU integration. Are you not learning from the lessons of history? Are you not condemned to relive them? You cannot play political make-believe with people’s lives. Your people and people across Europe came out onto the streets to show their displeasure at the medication for the Eurocrats’ mental illness. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, and this year people across Europe will have the chance to put a dagger in the heart of the European Union. A significant number of these people have plenty of time to go to the polling station as they are unemployed, a core failure of the EU project. Mr Samaras, you are in make-believe land if you think the EU is the solution. In the UK we also have a leader who lives in make-believe land and who believes that he can renegotiate serious powers from the EU before a referendum. But we have heard this con trick before. The British people have waited far too long to have the choice to leave this corrupt and doomed mess that is the EU. In May’s elections we will let the people decide. We will put the option on the ballot paper in Britain for the people to demand a referendum now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, as a member of the Chilean delegation I visited Chile last year. I am quite happy with the Free Trade Agreement we have with Chile, and I agree that Chile has proved itself to be a strong and reliable trade partner. Great strides forward have been made in Chile with respect to human rights. It is now a fully functioning democracy and has put aside all its past troubles, but I think we must be very strong with the human rights element throughout Latin America.  I attend lots of talks where people ask me about Free Trade Agreements, as they wonder what exactly they are and I have to tell them. They ask if the United Kingdom would not have a Free Trade Agreement if it left the European Union. That is a good question, because here we are with a Free Trade Agreement with countries on the other side of the world, yet the threat to the people that I represent is that if you leave the EU you would not have a Free Trade Agreement. I think it is probably relevant that I make the point here in the Chamber at some point, so I have done so tonight. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, well, here we are still in very great economic hardship across the continent, and what does the European Union decide to discuss at the top of the agenda for a Council meeting? Defence. I would argue that across Europe – not just the United Kingdom – defence is way down the list of people's concerns and of what they want to discuss. They want to discuss employment, they want to discuss how much it costs them to live, growing inflation, but that is not what you want to talk about. You want to talk defence. We have heard the Commission here talking about competing with the USA. Why would you want to compete with the USA? We are 28 sovereign nations. There is no will, in the United Kingdom at least, to be one sovereign nation called the European Union. You have to have the consent of people, but you do not want that. You want to move forward in this one superstate. We should not be competing with the USA. We should be working with the USA. Why do we want to reinvent the wheel? We have NATO and NATO is tried and tested. We need to reinvigorate NATO. That is what we need to do.  And employment? And the euro? You are congratulating yourself because Latvia is joining. You have had sticking plaster over sticking plaster on your euro single currency and the wound has congealed, and you are putting another one on with Latvia. But we all know what happens when you leave a plaster on. The wound becomes infected and when you finally have to remove that plaster, it is far more painful – and that is as good an analogy as I have for the euro. It will be a painful, slow decline and, when it finally rips apart, it will hurt and it will hurt the people of Europe. Stop this madness now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, the European Social Fund’s remit is to invest in people and to support employment, especially amongst the young who see their futures receding in a Europe of austerity and unemployment. I know the EU food aid programme, the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived, is also to receive its funding through the ESF.  In my constituency of the West Midlands, my office has collected over three tonnes of food for distribution to food banks. Across the country, more than 350 000 people are dependent on these food banks to feed themselves and their families. It has been estimated that if current trends continue, more than half a million people could be receiving food parcels by 2016. These are basic supplies, not luxury foods and wine such as those that will be enjoyed in the Members’ dining room today. A recent study found that malnutrition is on the rise in the UK. One in ten older people are malnourished. This fact is a warning sign and it is where the problem first becomes apparent. The Archbishop of Canterbury just three days ago insisted on a plea for more financial support for the rapidly expanding network of food banks. We see it here debating new legislation whilst people are suffering back home. There is a joke that is popular in England at the moment. President Barroso is asked by a Greek citizen: Have we achieved full European integration? The answer from Barroso is: Oh no, it will get a lot worse yet. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, we certainly need more women in our boardrooms. We certainly need more women in politics. There can be no doubt about that. The question is how we go about it. I do not believe, Ms Reding, that your proposals will help the situation. I think that, on the contrary, they will make it worse. Women business leaders tell me that, actually, they do not want to be put on boards by patronising laws. They want to be put there on merit. Now, speaking as someone who has been discriminated against, I think all forms of discrimination are wrong, as is positive discrimination, because positive discrimination is discrimination, and discrimination creates victims. It does not matter what gender you are: if you believe in equality and you create discrimination, you create a victim. Ms Reding, do not legislate to make victims. That is not what you are in your job to do. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, businesses – small, medium and large – have been contacting me in their droves about this much-vaunted EU investment, this mythical EU money that the pro-European argument says the UK is so heavily dependent on. Let us put aside the argument that EU money actually does not exist. The fact is that there have been no calls, from 2000 onwards, for grants. This is because delays in agreeing budgets have led to indecision and confusion over such EU funds. Civil society, the bedrock of democracy, is promised EU grants, but again there has been too much uncertainty and, more disastrously, inaction. I note, on the other hand, that the EU is not too slow when taking our money – our taxpayers’ money – but is too arrogant and negligent in throwing back some crumbs. No wonder the people of the United Kingdom have decided – and want to decide in a referendum – that they no longer want to be part of this sham and that they want to spend their money in the United Kingdom, not propping up some failing countries across Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, this is on a point of order which I will come to, but as a Member representing the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom where Malala now resides and where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, I congratulate this remarkable young woman who is deserving of this prize.  My point of order is quite significant. It is incredibly disappointing that you disrespected this Chamber and that the announcement was not made here live. It was announced on Twitter 30 minutes ago. I think you Mr President have disrespected this Chamber by announcing it on Twitter before doing so in this Chamber. (Mixed reactions) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, I would question the title of this debate about the Rise of right-wing extremism in Europe. Surely it should be about ‘extremism’. Commissioner Reding, I know your desire for equality, maybe you can tell us when we are going to debate ‘left-wing’ extremism, just in the name of equality. A key dynamic in politics is the relationship between the centre and the periphery. The centre, where power lies, in a truly democratic society is in a constant state of flux as opinion, debate and events filter to the centre and shift our values and priorities; this is very healthy. However, if those in power at the centre refuse to listen to the people whose concerns may be inconvenient, then by ignoring them they push them further out towards the periphery. They push them towards the extremes. Extreme thought, extreme speech and, ultimately, extreme acts.  It is no surprise to political observers in Britain that the far right only ever takes seats from the left: our Labour party, not the Conservative party. When Prime Minister Gordon Brown infamously labelled the respectable Labour voter, Gillian Duffy, as a bigot – simply for expressing genuine concerns about immigration and economic policy that differed to his own – he became a recruiting sergeant for extremists.  The blame for the rise of extremism lies at the feet of the political class that refuses to take account of the opinions and concerns of the electorate and the people to whom they should be accountable. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, well, here we go again. Squirm time for the European bureaucrats. They must really hate this, having to answer and put forward their figures because, seriously, they do not like scrutiny and they do not like transparency. This whole report lacks scrutiny, and it lacks transparency in the withholding of documents relating to significant expenditure – namely the purchase of the Residence Palace in Brussels, as previously mentioned – and in the refusal of the Council to address questions raised by a democratically-elected Parliament. A democratically elected Parliament! Her Majesty’s Government has drawn attention in the last few days to a cosy agreement in place since the 1970s, that two institutions would not scrutinise each other’s spending. Why are you so afraid of democratic scrutiny? You control Europe, you spend taxpayers’ money, your accounts for the whole of this institution have not been audited for 18 years and you do not care about democracy. I told my constituents in the West Midlands, the industrial heartland of the United Kingdom about this. I am not sure that they actually believed me. Incidentally, we British have a name for opaque and cosy arrangements such as these. We call them Spanish practices. I am very pleased that the rapporteur advocates voting against discharge of the 2011 budget. Of course, any agreement for scrutiny of another institution should be mutual. I would welcome scrutiny of this institution’s spending by the Council and I think the people of Great Britain would also welcome it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am amazed that we have had this State of the Union address today. I am surprised that Mrs Merkel has not asked us to postpone it until after the German general election. Well, Mr Barroso, this was your fourth and last State of the Union address and you have brought along the rest of your appointed Commission – for support. Never before has a tier of this Parliament been filled with such incompetence and failure. A question, why is it that it is the President of the unelected arm of the EU that gives this address? Why is it not President Schulz? One Member of your Commission is here today, despite only having an attendance record of 52%, almost as low as a UKIP MEP. Your flagship policy, when you became President, was the much-vaunted Lisbon Strategy which seeks to make the EU the most dynamic economy in the world. That sank without trace. In fact the EU has gone into reverse. Unemployment, especially among youth, is rocketing and little Miss Red Tape sitting next to you is not helping. Mr Barroso, your own Commission’s poll shows there is no trust in the EU. The people of the biggest five countries feel the EU is not working. Two-thirds of people across the EU think their views are not being heard. No wonder – but when they do express an opinion, for example in a rare referendum, they are treated with contempt and told that somehow they do not understand. The arrogance is palpable. The people must be listened to. Let the people decide. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, I was extremely disappointed that Mr Barroso did not answer my main question: why it should be he, the unelected representative of an EU institution, giving the State of the Union address rather than the elected representative, Mr Schulz. Maybe you could help me on this point, Mr Barroso? We do not agree on much, and I do not agree with your vision of a united Europe, but I do agree with you, Mr Barroso, that if the club is going to prosper, if it is going to work, you need all the members inside working towards that. I need to ask you then: why do you not challenge the UK to put up or shut up? Why do you go along with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, pretending that he can renegotiate to recover powers from the European Union? Are you saying that he can renegotiate certain items from the Treaty of Rome? Can you just make it clear, once and for all, that renegotiation of significant powers such as the Social Chapter is not possible? Is it not damaging to the European Union to have the UK in its current predicament until 2017? Is it not time for the UK and its people to decide, sooner rather than later, whether they want the country to remain a member of the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, these elections have had progressively lower turnouts, election by election. In fact the electorate is generally voting on national issues, which shows that the plan for a federal Europe does not really have public consent, does it? Even where there have been referendums, you federalists have been defeated until you have made the voters vote again. You do not care about the voters of Europe, do you? Mr Duff, the British press has today carried criticism of your plan for pan-European political parties to participate in our elections. What you clearly do not understand is that the people do not want this. Latvian accession to the single currency was approved today by this Parliament, despite an admission in the – appropriately named – Balz report that the Latvian people do not really want it. You talk in the report about citizens being ‘directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament’. They already are represented by Members they have voted for, but the traditional view of a democratic representative is not good enough for you, is it, Mr Duff? Of course this is not what we really want, is it? What you want, Mr Duff, is for citizens to be represented by people who agree with your own federalist vision of Europe. The people may not want that, Mr Duff, but what does that really matter to you? What we need is a referendum about our membership of the European Union. That is what the people of the United Kingdom want. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, medical practitioners will know the acronym FTT well. It stands for ‘failure to thrive’. The idea of imposing new taxes on European business at a time of economic hardship and rising unemployment has been described as perverse and unacceptable by the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. But this is not an economic decision, is it? This is a political project. Even Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, stated recently that the FTT posed a very real risk to the economy, confirming the observation by Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, that even amongst the 11 Member States that agreed to press forward, there is not unqualified support.  For a financial transaction tax to work, it would have to be global, as its proposer, James Tobin, stated, but do we think for one minute that the G20 would be prepared to follow the lead of the people who inflicted the euro area on the world? Tomorrow we will vote on whether to allow Latvia to buy the last ticket on the Titanic. This tax must never be allowed to set sail. It should be strangled at birth. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I contend that the EU is the sick man of the developed world, as much mentally ill as physically. The EU leaders meet for another late-night supper, then adjourn to the drawing room for their usual game of economic bluff, while quislings put together some incoherent mumbo-jumbo communiqué. The idea of the game is simple: to let all 27 leaders leave with some credibility and be able to say that something has been won for their countries. In the UK we know that the game is EU deception: a game our last eight Prime Ministers have played in Brussels. The real losers are the people of Europe, who pay for this late-night folly. Some ex-players of the game, such as former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, have now said that it is time the UK left the EU. Of course he was rounded on by Europhile business leaders coming out with the usual tripe about UK trade being affected. I wholeheartedly agree with his response on the BBC this week, when he called them economic illiterates. We know about these scaremongering stories; during the single currency debate of the late 1990s, Nissan warned that they would remove their investment from the UK if we did not join the euro. Well, they did not. In fact they invested more.  I suggest a new game for Thursday night called ‘reality’, where Europe’s leaders realise that their beloved Europe federal project has failed and that the single currency is unsustainable without the express consent of the people of Europe to federalising steps, and understand that the people of the UK no longer wish to subsidise your pie-in-the-sky projects whilst they are suffering crippling cut-backs at home. I understand that the best treatment for mental illness is accepting the illness and accepting reality. I commend it to you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is wonderful that Heads of Government and Heads of State come here to set out their agenda, and dialogue is never a bad thing. However, I think there is one notable exception, or rather one person who has not come here who has a lot to say about Europe. That is the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who reckons he can renegotiate, for example, the Social Chapter. Is it not about time that he came to this Chamber and explained what he really meant, so that we, the elected representatives of people across Europe, could see whether the UK actually could renegotiate its terms of membership?

Madam President, many of my colleagues here today have called for one voice for the European Union, indeed one mentioned ambassadors rather than heads of delegation. But surely that needs some type of federalism? The European Union does not have a mandate for that. That is why, in my view, the EEAS is fundamentally flawed. I am sure it is a big problem for Baroness Ashton to carry out her duties when she cannot speak for all 27 nations. But I cannot help the feeling that she is part-author of her own problems. Of course she was leader of the Lords when she pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, when she argued there was no fundamental change of power. And here she is in fact really wanting more power. So which was it, Baroness Ashton? You know, you cannot have it both ways. The only way that the EU can actually speak with one voice is if it gives a mandate from the people. One specific question that I would really like you to answer this afternoon: in what capacity, Baroness Ashton, were you at the Champions League final this year? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, while I welcome this debate about poverty in Europe, I think that using EU funding to tackle domestic poverty issues is highly unfair to the taxpayers of those few countries that actually make significant contributions to the EU budget. In the UK, there is a growing resentment towards those Member States that are seen as being takers. It is deeply regrettable that the UK, with its great tradition of helping those less fortunate than itself, has a growing resentment about funding this or that EU project while British people are suffering crippling cutbacks at home. No wonder more and more people are turning against the European Union. Only last week, the leading philanthropist Bill Gates, a regular visitor to the European Parliament, congratulated the United Kingdom on its remarkable record in foreign aid – a record, incidentally, that the EU likes to piggyback on and take credit for.  This report acknowledges that Member States should take responsibility for issues of poverty and social inclusion, and that the fund for European aid and the most deprived should not be seen as replacing those responsibilities. But what message is being sent out by the call for an increased budget for the fund for 2014-2020? Who will supply this extra money: the 200 000 British citizens who are dependent on food banks in order to feed their families, or the growing army of unemployed youth? The economic crisis, largely the fault of the eurozone, is now so bad that we have to say charity begins at home. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, 1.3 million families – that is one in four families in England – are on lower incomes. They have to spend a third of their net income on housing, largely owing to the shortage of private rental sector housing, which was exacerbated in the 1980s by the Conservative Party’s failure to build social housing programmes and the Labour Party of the 1990s failing to tackle that issue. I am glad that this is a national competence, and it should stay a national competence. However, the EU has a detrimental impact. We currently have a government in the United Kingdom saying that it does not know how many people who will be coming from Romania and Bulgaria, or indeed from across the European Union. How are our local authorities supposed to make provision when current provision does not meet demands? This is why we have problems of people in the private sector not being able to afford housing on a third of their income – some GBP 500 in Coventry. That is not affordable, and we cannot provide this any longer. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, one word: ‘consistency’. I will repeat it again so that the interpreters get it to you in time: ‘consistency’. I have been here four years, and not once have I been told that you have to have the question in before the start of the process. This is the first time this has happened. If this is the case, then you should announce it before the votes even begin. It was my understanding that you had to have your request for a question in before the subject or report was brought up. It is a complete inconsistency, and you are denying me my full mandate by not allowing me my explanation of vote on this report, so I ask you once again to give me my explanation of vote because you are denying me my mandate.

Mr President, I have heard of the carrot and stick approach, but I have never heard of the carrot and carrot approach. That seems to be the EU’s relationship with Turkey. It seems to give, give, give.  Can I remind this institution that the Cypriots held the Presidency in the latter part of 2012 and Turkey point blank refused to actually have anything to do with them, although they were a candidate country. Well if the candidate country does not want to have anything to do with its Presidency, surely the candidature should be ceased there and then.  The people of Cyprus are held hostage by the invaders and occupiers of northern Cyprus. The people of Morphou last November, together with myself, attempted to visit their town and were refused free access to their old town by the Turkish authorities. The people of Kyrenia wished to celebrate a religious service in their town over the coming Easter and have been refused by the Turkish authorities.  Baroness Ashton is being her usual, useless self and is unable to help. Is it not about time we got real on Turkey? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, first of all I would like to express my agreement with the comment made about the Boston bombing. I send my condolences to the victims and their families, and my best wishes to the injured. Terrorism must not, and will never, succeed. The debate is about the future of the European Union, and I must say that I normally struggle to make my case in a minute, but such a debate is a very short one. What future does it have? Is it like the Soviet empire that had a blatant disregard for its people, which ignores it opinions and fails to give referendums – and when it does, it ignores the result and then calls for other referendums? Does it steal the savings of ordinary people, like it did in Cyprus? Does it disregard an occupying force in North Cyprus, even though it is part of the European Union – which unbelievably has the status of Nobel Prize Winner? Is this the future of the European Union? No. The future of the European Union is doomed. It is doomed to failure. It does not have a democratic mandate. You are frightened of the people. The European Union is failing, and that is why the UK needs to be out of it soon. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, a week ago we lost a great political figure, a woman who achieved the highest office in the land from humble beginnings – in fact, the first elected woman in the western world. Incidentally she achieved that without the need of a quota, something which this House believes so firmly in. When she took office, the United Kingdom was the sick man of Europe, but her strong policies, handling of the economy and dealing with trade unions – a lesson which the French and Germans still have not learnt in thirty years – transformed the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The President, Mr Schultz, called her a great European. She did believe in the membership of the European Community and she signed the Single European Act, but when she realised it was getting into a federal Europe and a single currency she said, ‘No, no, no’, and that is why the cowards stabbed her in the back. From a personal point of view she inspired me into politics. I was ten when she was elected and I met her just three months before I was elected, and when I told her that I was coming here to fight for British independence from the European Union she told me never to give up, never to give up, and I can assure you I will never give up fighting for my country’s independence.

Mr President, my colleague talks about integrity, but maybe he would like to comment on the integrity of the EU in its last foray into professional football – the Bosman ruling – which I would say has probably caused some of the problem.  What it has done is taken the wealth from a lot of the smaller clubs and transferred it to the bigger clubs and created overpaid footballers, and underpaid footballers at a grassroots level. That is where the people who are involved in organised crime are actually attacking lower paid footballers. It is in the lower leagues that this match-fixing is taking place. The Bosman ruling – an EU ruling – has created that problem. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, this issue is close to my heart, as a lover of sport and a football season-ticket holder and sponsor of football at all levels, including grassroots. It is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Some people like to call it the beautiful game. Clearly, we are learning that football is becoming noticeably more grubby and sullied. According to experts, as many as ten matches a week in Europe are now affected by match-fixing. The numbers of games affected worldwide is astonishing.  However, it is not enough to look at this issue from a purely European perspective. Can we trust the EU Commission, with its history of corruption, to clear up sport? Maybe it is a ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’.  Match-fixing is an endemic problem across the world. Until nations and football authorities get their houses in order, how can we expect anything to change? Take a look at FIFA, for example, a body that has been dogged by accusations of corruption; or the FA back in my own country that fails to implement a working fit-and-proper-persons test, which allows vulnerable clubs to fall into the wrong hands.  Many of the players that get caught up in match-fixing accusations are often poorly paid, poorly educated and poorly protected. It is not enough for Europol to investigate this problem. UEFA has far more member countries than the EU, so proposed EU action would be an irrelevance. It is about time that we had transparent football authorities and legislation from national governments to stamp out this organised crime in football once and for all. I believe football can be beautiful again. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 I voted against this report not because I do not want to decrease the amount of MEPs far from it. I actively campaign for my own redundancy and the other 72 UK MEPs. I voted for the previous defeated amendment to call for the matter to be referred to an Independent body to determine to size and make-up of future parliaments. Politicians should not determine alone how they are to be elected. Also, this report allows for enlargement. Something I am opposed to. The EU cannot deal with itself at the moment let alone getting larger. To those countries that will lose an MEP, they should not worry, when the UK leaves they will have 73 seats to redistribute.

Mr President, once again Europe’s leaders will meet for a late night supper. The agenda may talk of growth and jobs, but we have heard it all before and nothing improves. Only lip service will be paid to jobs and growth. The real conversation over the foie gras will be how to save your beloved political project of European federalisation. The talk will be about how to keep Italy in line after its comical election and how to downplay yet another country, Cyprus, seeking a new bailout. British people know that problems come from Europe and they pay for them with cold, hard cash and the reduction of essential public services. British people are getting more and more fed up with the European Union. May I take this opportunity to thank Mr Barroso for helping with this. Despite Mr Cameron’s attempts to knock a referendum into the long grass, the British people demand a referendum on our membership now. My constituents send a clear message to my office, week in, week out, which is that they do not want anything more to do with this corrupt and doomed mess that is the European Union.

Mr President, in a dispute where up to 70 000 people have been killed and a million refugees have fled the country since the crisis began two years ago, the question must be posed: what good is Baroness Ashton? What is her highly expensive and ineffective EEAS achieving to alleviate the situation? The answer is very little, just typical EU lip-service – or you are an expensive lipstick, Mrs Ashton. Your authority is highly questionable. You represent 27 nations who have different outlooks. You have been heavily criticised here today by members of all political groups. Indeed, Mr Cameron said the UK was still an independent country when threatening to veto an EU extension to the arms embargo. What does that make you? Redundant? The situation in Syria is deplorable. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has today visited a UN refugee camp in Jordan and described the situation as heart-breaking. What will you do? Will you at least begin by putting Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, not a single sane person in this Chamber would disagree with me when I say that the common agricultural policy needs reforming.  The EU needs to reduce intervention to a genuine safety net, move towards a market-orientated approach and the end of a situation whereby farmers chase subsidies and not markets – the old-style CAP market production box marked ‘Failed projects’ it should be confined to.  What reform are we really going to see here? We have been talking about this for two years, and a quarter of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development opposed the report. What message does that send to the farming sector? Both environmentalists and farmers alike are highly critical of the green aspects of these proposals. How then can the public believe that their environmental concerns have been addressed? I believe that the people who are best qualified to look after the British landscape are the British farmers, not unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. The CAP is expensive and over-bureaucratised, and farmers in my constituency constantly contact me about this. It adds to the weekly food bill of every family in Great Britain. Professor Patrick Minford of Cardiff Business School, a leading critic of the CAP, is on record as stating that the average family would be much better off if we left the European Union, not only in terms of cheaper food.

Mr President, I have a question for my colleague. He has talked about potential national interest and each Member’s country not wanting to lose one. We have also had a slight accusation against my colleague, Mr Duff, that he may be doing it for political purposes. Does this not show that politicians should not determine how politicians are elected? The EU employs far more bureaucrats than necessary. Should it not be done without politicians making these decisions and just determined by independent bodies, as is done in the UK? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, democracy is far from perfect. While I feel that there should be some protection for some smaller countries, I think it is only fair to inform you that my country, the United Kingdom, is greatly under-represented. In fact, I represent a region, the West Midlands, which has some 5 million people. At the last election, six of us were elected, so that was about 900 000 people each.  We have Maltese MEPs and Luxembourgish MEPs, with populations of half a million also returning six MEPs. Now, I make a great effort in communicating with my constituents, but my allowances have to stretch to 5 million people, whereas an MEP from Luxembourg or Malta – with only 500 000 and a much smaller geographical area – is put at great advantage. I do not think that is taken into consideration. (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, this is a rather difficult subject, and I would say at the outset that I do not blame any immigrants who want to try and make a better life for themselves. What I do feel is that the politicians have let down the immigrants and the settled community. In 2004, when the Eastern Bloc countries joined the EU, our Labour Government told us that we would only have 14 000 people coming into the UK. Well, it hit over a million people. How were our local service providers – our National Health Service, our housing – able to plan ahead for that? Next year, we face more people coming from Bulgaria and Romania. How are our social services in the United Kingdom, which are already cut to the bone, and our taxpayers, who are paying more money, supposed to support that? It simply does not work. I am glad to see that our own government is beginning to take a stance on this, but even it cannot tell us how many people are coming next year. That is a fundamental problem with planning for social services in the United Kingdom. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am making a point of order on a point of order. You noticed my point of order previously and as I understand it – and I have taken issue with this once before – when a President notices that a Member wishes to make a point of order, he or she must take that point of order. You acted beyond your responsibilities in not taking my point of order earlier. The point of order was that the Non-Attached element of this House had not made any speech at all and yet you had given the catch-the-eye to groups that had spoken on numerous occasions.

Austerity is detrimental to disabled people (8 % of the UK population), who are finding themselves in a worst position of poverty than ever before. In the UK we have endured constant reassessments of the work capability assessment, which has led to the deaths and suicides of 73 disabled people per week. It is abhorrent that 29 % of the cuts are focused on disabled people. Fewer people are entitled to support from their local authorities, and we will see the introduction of personal independence payments to replace disability living allowance, which is set to knock over half a million people off support. There is also a proposal to close the Independent Living Fund permanently. The proposal by the government is to transfer monies to cash strapped local authorities; which are already saying that they will institutionalise disabled people, to save money. These are just some of the cuts impacting on disabled people in the UK, estimated to take GBP 9 billion from the poorest in society. No wonder British people are sick and tired of the EU. We have a saying ‘Charity begins at home’. Britain needs to look after its vulnerable people and not be hampered by sending GBP 53 million every day to the EU. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I really do have to admit I would love to be a fly on the wall in this Friday’s EU Budget talks in Brussels. I would like to see the discomfort of Mr Cameron as he walks into the room, the tension in his neck at the thought that he has to confront Mr Hollande and his colleagues throughout Europe. He has put referenda back on the agenda and he is going to have to sit down and fight for the British interest. He says he wants a renegotiation, but President Schulz has already told this Parliament that renegotiation is not possible. Mr Verhofstadt told the BBC renegotiation is not possible, so who is going to give? Are they going to be shown to be fools, or is Mr Cameron going to be shown to be a fool? I think Mr Cameron is trying to pull a Houdini act here. He is trying to appease the Eurosceptic majority in the UK, while trying to appease the European Union. This Houdini act is bound to fail and he will be shown to be more like Tommy Cooper.  My constituents tell me they do not want GBP 53 million spent in the EU. That money is better spent at home.

 Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague why she does not think the expenditure in this Parliament is too great. Two years ago the entertainment budget for MEPs or for Parliament went up 80%. Do you not think that was a substantial increase? In December, in the courtyard here in Strasbourg, we saw extortionate expenditure on television screens and posters that are still there about celebrating the Sakharov Prize. In that week each Member of Parliament and each member of staff was given probably five, six or seven pieces of chocolate. Do you not think that was unnecessary expenditure? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I used to go back and tell my constituents that this was the institution that knew no cutbacks. In my first few years as an MEP the allowances just went up and up and up and up. We all got a new member of staff for Lisbon; the attendance allowance went up from EUR 296 to EUR 304 euros. I have already mentioned that the entertainment budget went up 82%; everything just went up and up and up.  As we go towards 2014 you decided to make some minor cutbacks, forgetting what you paid in the first few years. You ignored reality for far too long and now you are wondering what to do. You are making the poor staff here suffer through no fault of their own on account of your political meddling. What about cutting Ms Ashton’s EEAS? What does it actually do? What about cutting that back? What about the shiny new offices for Mr Van Rompuy and Ms Cathy Ashton? And what about the bigger argument as to whether we should be here in Strasbourg? And what about Fridays here in Strasbourg? There are still 80 to 100 MEPs that come here on a Friday morning and sign in and go home when there is no official business. That is about EUR 30 000 month; should that not be cut out for a start? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, corporate social responsibility is a policy concept whereby businesses self-regulate in order to operate in an ethical and sustainable manner in order to understand and meet the needs and expectations of all stakeholders. In this report, however, this concept has been transformed into a jumble of slogans and key words seemingly intended to tick all the right boxes without explaining how exactly anything is to be actually achieved.  The concept of self-regulation has gone from this report and has seemingly been replaced by vague calls for Commission strategies, Commission guidelines, even concrete proposals from the Commission for the implementation of corporate socially responsible practices. The rapporteur – even if now he wants businesses, enterprises, to be responsible for solving social issues caused by the economic crisis – believes that the economic crisis has shaken employees’ faith in corporations to meet their pension obligations. No, Mr Howitt, it is the EU and the eurozone crisis that has done that.  This report flits from subcontracting to low carbon technology and to gender equality in the blink of an eye. The rapporteur calls for the launch of a new EU initiative on advancing materiality. He wants the EU to back a proposal for a UN convention on corporate responsibility. More bureaucracy is the last thing that businesses need at this time. The report refers to short-term thinking in Brussels in one breath and with the next it calls on the Commission to show leadership. It takes a concept based on self-regulation by wide, diverse and economic actions in 27 Member States and seeks to turn it into an EU competence where one size will not fit at all. It reads like a student manifesto, a first-year student manifesto. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, let us rewind a little. Before you roll out your latest grandiose plan, let us take a look back. Do you remember the Lisbon Agenda? Let me refresh your memory. It was adopted for a ten-year period in 2000 by the European Council. It broadly aimed to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. How did that go for you? Not well. You replaced it with another plan. Now your beloved political project is in dire straits. Millions across Europe are in despair, and now you are scurrying around looking for another plan. You cannot accept the political reality that your project is fundamentally flawed. Your foundations are as strong as the blancmange that I had for dessert last night. Whilst the euro sails into the rocks, the three presidents grandstand with the Nobel Prize. Did Nelson Mandela grandstand in the same manner? Did Barack Obama? No. They had dignity, and we are not seeking to create some useful diversion to problems so destructive to the peoples of Europe. No wonder the people of the UK demand a referendum to have their say on this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

But when she talks about the peace process, would she not agree with me that one of the main barriers to the peace process is Hamas’s refusal to recognise the state of Israel?

– Madam President, is it not deeply ironic in a debate about democracy that this Parliament is using rules to actually stifle debate? We are not allowed to use blue cards or catch-the-eye, which means that very small entities such as the non-attached Members get no speaking time at all. Of course we will all be standing in elections in 2014. You did say at the start of the debate that there would be no catch-the-eye, but you did not say, and it has not previously been put in any of the material or by e-mail, that there would be no blue cards. I think that is a real breach of this debate and shows the EU to be what it is: it talks about democracy but it does not want to let everyone have their say or even their vote. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, my constituents will not be too surprised to learn that their hard-earned money taken by taxes and passed on to the EU is being negligently handed out by the net recipients of the EU budget. In a week when many Member States are seeking an increase in the EU budget to just over EUR one trillion, my constituents in the UK say this is unacceptable in a time of austerity. The blame for the failure to have the audit signed off for the 18th year lies firmly at the door of the unelected bureaucrats of the EU. They have failed the taxpayers of Europe once again. I note that 60 % of the errors found by the Court could have been detected by Member States, yet it is the quagmire of rules and unnecessary complications that is at fault. And what is the EU doing to correct this? It is not even notifying the Member States concerned of the direct problems. One of the examples of the billions wasted is the EUR 700 million to establish the rule of law and reduce corruption in Kosovo, but the results are poor according to the report. Staff delegated were not even sufficiently trained, yet the EU thinks that by throwing in taxpayers’ money without reasonable constraint it can solve the problem. And what about pan-European parties? What about public financing of political parties such as the right-wing extremist parties to which some UKIP Members have signed up, some Nazis – what about the financing of that? A colleague of mine talked about confidence. Well, the people of the UK have less and less confidence in the EU, which is why we need an in-or-out referendum, sooner rather than later. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I can say with some certainty that, in times of austerity, my constituents do not want their taxes spent on political campaigns and propaganda. I voted against these proposals that seek to further the use of pan-European parties, with all their expense and their ideology of promoting EU federalism. The majority of people in the UK do not share an EU identity. In successive EU elections, people have used the elections to express their disapproval of the EU. Opinion poll after opinion poll shows dissatisfaction with the EU and a wish for a referendum. My constituents do not wish to hear propaganda, paid for by their taxes, telling them how great the EU is. They feel the reality of cutbacks in public services, whilst the UK pays more and more to the EU – a luxury we cannot afford. In 2014 the We Demand a Referendum Party will put on the ballot paper those words, ‘We demand a referendum’. This will allow the electorate from the UK to send you, and our government, a message, loud and clear, that we demand an in-out referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, once again we have a summit that promises a solution but in the fullness of time delivers little but further EU integration. Through the fault of unelected, incompetent Eurocrats and blinded Member State leaders, the financial crisis is being used as a tool for further EU integration. What a heavy price we are paying for the Eurocrats’ fantasy of a United States of Europe. Have they learned nothing from their folly? President Barroso and his apparatchiks care little for the ordinary person. This latest round has been done on the back of the Greek collapse and the 43 % increase in the suicide rate there. My fear is for the UK which, despite being out of the eurozone, is seemingly unaffected. Yet this deal fails to safeguard the City of London and its prosperity. David Cameron has given the green light to banking union and got nothing in return. Why? Was this not the opportunity to renegotiate some of those powers back from the European Union, as Cameron endlessly promises? It shows his words to be empty and that once again we have a Conservative Party which talks tough on Europe, with its sprinkling of Judas goats. But Cameron turns out to be nothing more than the German Chancellor’s poodle. Three out of four Conservative voters want an ‘in or out’ referendum but are being deceived by their leadership, which continues to sleepwalk the UK into a federal Europe. So I call on those Conservative supporters to stand up to David Cameron for the future of your party and for our country. Send him a loud message: we demand a referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I recently spent some time in Cyprus, taking part in anti-occupation events against the illegal Turkish occupation, which has now been going on for 38 years. Turks hold 38 % of Cypriot lands when Cyprus is actually part of the European Union. It was while I was in Cyprus that I learned that the European Union had won the Nobel Peace Prize. That may be a joke, but not for the people of Cyprus. Part of that award was for dispute resolution, but what has the European Union done to help the people of Cyprus? There were 1 619 people missing after the Turkish invasion. Not enough work has been done. Yet Turkey is still a candidate country and does not even recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is an EU Member State. It does not even recognise the Cyprus EU Presidency. What is the European Union doing about this? It is an absolute joke. I call for justice for internal refugees in Cyprus and justice and human rights for the families of the missing people.

– Madam President, when I listen to Baroness Ashton extolling the great successes of the European External Action Service, I am reminded of the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, where a well-meaning but seriously challenged and naive young man finds himself at the centre of events. He was surrounded by the great and the good, but was never really sure of what was going on. We have seen the faltering and sometimes painful transition to democracy of the long-suffering peoples in the Arab Spring; the ongoing civil war in Syria; fears over nuclear proliferation; the death of Gaddafi; and the return of Putin. These are challenging times in which we are seeing relationships and dynamics redefined. However, at a recent meeting with an exasperated diplomat from the Middle East, he told me that he regarded the High Representative as being more of a hindrance than a help. We all understand that Baroness Ashton drew the short straw. Her role is that of a caretaker of an unformed entity. History is unlikely to remember her in any great detail, but she once found herself elevated to the British House of Lords without ever receiving a single vote in any democratic election. As Forrest Gump pointed out so eloquently, life is like a box of chocolates and we will never know what comes next. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I should like to begin by saying kalimera
, President Christofias. It was a delight to meet you when I came to Nicosia in 2009. Can I pay tribute to your efforts to solve the Cyprus problem; a problem which is way overdue. The ongoing insult given to you by the Turkish Government of not recognising you as the President of Cyprus is something which should be highlighted in this Chamber. I would call on you and the EU to remove the candidate status of Turkey, because they have shown themselves not able to communicate with the European Community. You talk about this as being a bastion of democracy. However, you were educated in Russia and you would have seen how the Duma was no more a bastion of democracy than this place is in relation to the Politburo, which is probably likened to the Commission led by Mr Barroso, who uses this place as a veil of democracy for its actions. You are right to highlight that the problem of your Presidency is the plight of workers. In Athens you will find graffiti that says: let us refuse to live as slaves. Your background and your ideology as a Communist will make this very difficult for you. How are you going to protect the workers or stand up for the workers with the austerity that Angela Merkel and the rest of the European Union is pushing forward? Surely you would agree with me that EU 2020 lacks 20/20 vision? I have no doubt it will be as successful as the Lisbon Strategy, which was meant to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. You said in an interview on television last night not to expect a mountain from Cyprus. Well, the EU is the Everest of all … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Our forces are stationed on Cyprus, at costs of tens of millions of pounds every year, to safeguard Cyprus. If it was not for British forces I think that Turkey would have gone a long way further in 1974. But has this place moved on? I thought this place was about the future. What about the Austro-Hungarian Empire? What about Italian colonialism? What about French colonialism? What about Portuguese colonialism? What about German expansion? Are you moving on or do you want to be part of the past? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, many of my constituents have contacted me regarding being disadvantaged by an uneven playing field in the direct payments and CAP in general. Direct payments, or direct subsidies to farmers, account for three quarters of the CAP budget, which, of course, is 48% of the EU budget, so it is quite a considerable amount of money. However, the Conservative-led British Government is reluctant to make use of some of those discretionary funds that are available to support our farmers. In fact, they are increasing the uneven playing field by wishing to voluntarily reduce direct payments faster than any other Member State, which is why I will be voting against Amendments 1 to 12 and 13. The struggles of UK farmers are compounded by the Commission’s ongoing use of the historical distribution key to allocate Pillar 2 funds between Member States. This discrimination against the UK primarily needs to stop. We need a fairer allocation of Pillar 2 farmers and to protect our farmers in the UK. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, the announcement of the ending of cooperation with the Justice and Home Affairs Council has taken me somewhat by surprise, considering the previous criticisms of the United Kingdom for taking its ball away when it decide not to cooperate with the European Council. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, this act purports, via a package of measures, to boost assistance for small and medium businesses yet I fear, once again, it is nothing more than comforting words to give the appearance of action. The reality is that the European Union is part of the problem, not the solution. Europhiles like Malcolm Harbour tell us that Britain’s future depends on membership of the European Union, that more than half of our trade is with the EU. These are disingenuous arguments. Eighty percent of UK trade is internal, with 50% of the rest being with the EU. That is only 10% of UK trade, for which we have had a deficit since the early 1970s. Yet the EU and its bureaucratic rules and regulations are draining the life out of small and medium enterprises. No wonder the Federation of Small Businesses said to prospective MEPs in the 2009 European election guide, please, no more EU regulations. Malcolm Harbour attended a dinner, as I did. Commissioner Barnier, there are 4.5 million small businesses in the UK that account for 99% of all enterprise. That is almost 60% of private sector employment and almost 50% of private sector turnover. SMEs employ an estimated 13.8 million people and have an estimated combined annual turnover of GBP 1 500 billion. The EU has constantly negatively impacted on their ability to service the majority of their contracts, whilst making it easier for other EU countries to trade in the UK. No wonder eight out of ten people want a referendum on Britain’s membership of this corrupt and doomed mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, while I am opposed to this institution, I welcome any forum to discuss an issue that is so repugnant. Worldwide, it is estimated that well over 120 million women will be subjected to female genital mutilation. The aim of the process is to ensure that the woman is faithful to her future husband. Some communities consider girls ineligible for marriage if they have not been circumcised. How can you use religion and cultural tradition to excuse child abuse? It has been reported that girls as young as three undergo this process. Member States must tackle, and take a lead in combating, this despicable crime. Where the crime takes place in a Member State, strong custodial sentences must be passed. When aid is provided to countries where this is prevalent, conditions must be put in place to send a clear message that this practice must stop. Thankfully, due to health campaigns, female circumcision has been falling in some countries in the last decade. These involve a week-long programme of community education about the negative effects of female genital mutilation, culminating in a coming of age ceremony for young women. The young women are secluded for a week and undergo classes on reproduction, anatomy, hygiene, respect for adults, developing self-esteem and dealing with peer pressure. All of us here must do whatever we can to stop this barbarism. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, this issue stems from the failure of the French authorities to regulate its manufacturing industry. Typically, ‘France has a take it or leave it’ approach to regulations that it expects other countries to adopt. In June 2000, US medical regulators posted a warning letter on the Internet about problems at a breast implant maker in southern France. The French authorities did not pay this much attention. The French health authorities acknowledged as much in a 175-page report published on 1 February this year. Radical change is needed in Europe to ensure proper surveillance of medical devices. France has shown itself incapable of regulating itself and should have external checks. Many thousands of women have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, because of French negligence. France should be made to compensate all women affected by this negligence. In future, there needs to be more communication with the surgeons, the clinics and the patients. These companies must be checked and the findings should be open to inspection by health professionals. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Madam President, I would be interested to know what my colleague feels about Mr Howitt’s response. Not only was Mr Howitt rude by not turning up at his allotted speaking time, but he actually did not answer the question at all. If this Chamber had any credibility, these blue-card questions would be respected. Mr Howitt was asked a question after he said that he did not agree with political appointments; he was asked what he thought of Ms Ashton’s appointment, which was political. What does my colleague think about Mr Howitt’s reply? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, first of all, I did actually ask a question. If I used the words ‘does my colleague agree with me’, that usually begins a question. Now for my speech. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson institutionalised the concept of human rights in the US Declaration of Independence, and today’s US Ambassadors around the world have the responsibility for projecting that concept wherever they may be. In my country, Great Britain, human rights matters come under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, but these models are apparently not good enough for the European Union. The rapporteur calls for a Special Representative for this policy area, complete with his or her budget lines and dedicated staff. It is not, of course, within the realm of possibility that the existing EU overseas delegations could shoulder this responsibility. Might that eat into their four-day weeks and prolonged holiday entitlements? There are incidentally 119 such delegations. Surely, at a time of EU-enforced austerity, in situ apparatus should be used, rather than creating new, expensive departments. One aspect of the report I do agree with is that if a Special Representative for Human Rights should be appointed, they should have the necessary professional qualifications, extensive experience and a proven track record in the field of human rights, as well as personal and professional integrity and an international reputation. The High Representative may feel a little embarrassed at this valid point as these criteria were clearly overlooked in her appointment. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, the ever-growing figure of youth unemployment results from the selfishness of today’s politicians abandoning tomorrow’s prospects. In the UK, there has been a 43% increase in the number of young people aged 18 to 24 who have not had a job for more than two years. It would seem that some have given up on looking for work and are becoming increasingly detached from society. The youth unemployment crisis can be beaten only if job creation for young people becomes a key priority in policy making and private sector investment picks up significantly. My concern is that the EU is far too rigid in its general approach to law making to be of any real assistance to our young people. Yes, you might point to this scheme or that scheme, but the bureaucracy to apply for support is so disproportionate to the assistance required that it becomes self-defeating. The UK needs to offer tax breaks and other incentives to businesses hiring young people and offering more entrepreneurship programmes to help kick-start careers. EU, you are part of the problem, not the solution. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, we have heard a lot of fine words today about small businesses being the backbone of society and our economy, etc., etc., but what about the reality? I am reminded that President De Gaulle scoffed at the English and called us a nation of shopkeepers. But, Mr President, it is our small businesses and our shopkeepers that employ the vast majority of the workforce in the United Kingdom. In my mobile surgery, that goes around every town and city in the West Midlands on a regular basis, I meet shopkeepers who say they are being strangled by European Union regulation; business rates are too high; there is not enough training; there is not enough access to finance. Yet all they hear of, all the time, is more EU funds – the UK being the second largest contributor to the EU but having few recipients of aid and training. Take the European Globalisation Fund: every other country in the EU has had access to this fund except the United Kingdom. This is pertinent in Ryton, near Coventry, where Peugeot closed down in 2005. It also closed plant in France, but the French got training and the people of Coventry did not. Then there are these ‘JEREMIE’ funds, providing funding for small businesses around Europe, including in the south of France – a country that is a member of the G8. Is there any in the UK? No, there is not. Absolutely disgraceful! As I said, we are the second largest contributor to the European Union; we need to cut out the middle man, fund our own small businesses and leave the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, our youth’s prospects are dying of bureaucracy and its weapon of choice, red tape. Youth unemployment is a scourge that will affect Europeans for generations. People who suffer unemployment in their early years subsequently tend to earn much less. They suffer deterioration of skills and future job instability. In Spain, a staggering 46.4% of young people are out of work. Is it any coincidence that the states with the worst problems are members of the eurozone? The OECD has stated that the eurozone crisis is the biggest single threat to global recovery. The eurozone 17 will see their economy shrink by 1.9% this year. In contrast, both the UK and the US economies will grow. More than one in five young people across the European Union as a whole are unemployed and figures released yesterday by the UN suggest that this is set to get worse. UK businesses, both small and large, are crying out for less bureaucracy. Tomorrow, EU leaders will meet in Brussels to discuss jobs and growth. We can expect a self-congratulatory press release and a nice photograph, but we know by now what will happen. Good money will be thrown after bad. Nothing will change and, instead of stemming the red tape that kills jobs, the strangulation will continue. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr Kirkhope, would you join me in calling for the Conservative-led coalition to introduce gay marriage at its earliest possible convenience within the lifetime of this Parliament. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, as an openly gay person myself, I agree with virtually everything that has been said in this Chamber this afternoon, except probably Mr Posselt’s speech. My concern, however, is that we have heard all these grand words condemning homophobia here, but what about practising what you preach? I have been the victim of two homophobic incidents since I have been a member of this Chamber, and Parliament simply has not bothered to act. If you are going to tell other countries, especially third countries, what to do, at least first practise what you preach. Fortunately, as Baroness Ludford has said, I live in a country that has been reported to be one of the best places – or the best place – in the world to be gay. I count myself quite fortunate. Unfortunately, there are many other people in the world who cannot say the same thing. Yet there is a football tournament on our doorstep in Ukraine – which will be held jointly with Poland – and many Members of this House will be travelling to Ukraine as representatives of some organisation or other, or representatives of the European Union, while today, the UK Foreign Office has put a warning out to gay people to be careful travelling to Ukraine. Why should a single member of this House or the European Union go to Ukraine? Should the European Union as a whole not be boycotting the tournament if that country cannot protect citizens? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I have lost count. Is this the 17th year in which the auditors have failed to give a positive declaration on the EU’s budget or, in other words, have we now reached 17 years in which taxpayers’ money has not been properly accounted for? I note the statement in the resolution on the discharge of the Commission budget that progress has been made since the resignation of the Santer Commission, but I have to ask: ‘Really?’ In 2008, Commissioner Mandelson was accused of a conflict of interest after holidaying with a Russian oligarch whose company subsequently benefited from his department’s decisions. In June 2011, Commission President Barroso ran up a EUR 25 000 hotel bill for a four-night luxury stay in New York. Then there was the Commission memo issued by DG Trade in 2009 which encouraged officials to conceal information from public scrutiny. The EU and its institutions have failed to practise what they preach and what places them above the citizens they purport to represent. It is time the UK left this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question. 
– 
Madam President, my colleague Mr Fox alluded to the fact that there are already 27 signatories to the Convention and that this would just be a pruning exercise – or rather a preening exercise – by the European Union. Would he not agree with me that this is a further stage of federalisation and that in the 2010 Conservative manifesto it was stated that it would repeal the Human Rights Act, which was brought in by the Labour Party? Now, if this was actually signed, it would mean that they would not have the power to do so. Is this not another massive transference of sovereignty that his party will allow to happen? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, as a MEP I deal with constituency issues on a daily basis: issues where EU law affects people’s daily lives, either directly or indirectly. I am here to tell you that there is one deeply flawed law that, above all others, damages British life and puts our lives in daily peril. It is the Human Rights Act. It is a rotten law that Britain loathes. Human rights are worth protecting, and I am vocal in the protection of human rights. The Human Rights Act, however, was created in Britain by the Labour Party, which, despite warnings, was reckless as to the consequences. However, this EU-backed – and soon to be enshrined – law is now routinely and regularly abused by those who can cause havoc in civil society. Terrorists, criminals and illegal immigrants, with and without cats. More often than not, judges who apply human rights law decide that those rights trump those of the majority: decent, honest, hard-working British people. The case of Abu Qatada is attracting media attention. The human rights law, by allowing Abu Qatada to dodge deportation to Jordan, has inflamed the British public. Simply, the Court of Human Rights leaves Britain unable to defend its interests. In a recent survey, 75% of British people said they think that the act should be scrapped altogether. It is the Treaty of Lisbon that allows the EU to sign up to the ECHR, which further imprisons the British public, who never got a chance to say no through a referendum. Let me tell you, the British public are shouting aloud: ‘No to the human rights law! Release us from these shackles’.

blue-card answer. 
– 
Madam President, not as big a sigh of relief as the British public would! Yes, Mr Cashman, I agree with you. The Convention on Human Rights was actually written by British lawyers in the early 1950s. It was the Labour Party that signed the Human Rights Act, which enshrined it in British law. That was in 1998. What it actually did was to empower every court, from the most minute up to the Supreme Court (no longer the House of Lords), to apply these human rights, and the judges have taken political jurisprudence. They have not gone along with the public or the elected government. That has to be wrong. In a democracy it should be the will of the people that reigns supreme. If you talk about human rights, Mr Cashman, I want to point out one Labour politician, our High Representative Catherine Ashton – a Labour Party card-carrying member – who refused to do anything about the corrective rape of lesbians in Palestine. That is a disgrace. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I welcome the international dialogue at the conference this week in Marseille. It is imperative that all decision-makers, from local governments through to Member States and the UN, promote initiatives for water quality, availability and affordability. Water is a common good and a human essential, and it is also a human right which should not be used for excessive commercial profit. With this in mind, the fact the Forum’s President, Louis Fauchon, has a foot in both camps is deeply troubling. Member States must give farmers incentives to increase investment in on-farm water storage capacity, which takes up as much as 70% of natural water supply, although the UK National Farmers Union has warned that there is no quick fix. I am also dismayed that in this year of CAP reform – as has been mentioned here by one of my colleagues – there is no mention of this matter. Is this a question of the EU talking with one head and then not talking with the other? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr Howitt, you mentioned two things which I want to bring together: Gaza and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights. Would you agree with me and criticise the High Representative for her failure to tackle the issue of corrective rapes of lesbians in Palestine, and also police brutality against LGBT people in Palestine? I visited Gaza and Palestine in November last year. This is evidently a problem that the EU ignores, but it still funds Palestine and it is afraid to tackle this problem on cultural grounds. Would you criticise them for that? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, amongst the items on the agenda at the forthcoming UN Human Rights Council will be Cyprus. I would like to concentrate on human rights issues in Northern Cyprus and their place in negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In Northern Cyprus itself, there have been reports of violations of the human rights and freedom from discrimination of minorities, torture, and violations of freedom of movement, religion and speech. In 1974, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the city of Famagusta was overrun by armour, and the civilian population – fearing massacre – was forced to evacuate, leaving behind everything they could not carry. Only Turks were allowed to remain, and the Varosha section of the city remains isolated and unpopulated to this day. This is in contradiction with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789. Technically, this border dispute does call into question the legitimacy of the Cypriot accession to the European Union. A 112-mile long ‘green line’ still divides the island. 1 588 Greek Cypriots are still on the missing persons list following the Turkish invasion, but still the EU – with the exception of one or two Member States –pushes for Turkey’s accession. By discussing Turkey’s accession whilst unresolved border issues and questions of human rights in Northern Cyprus remain, the EU is undermining the integrity of the United Nations. You are overlooking appalling human rights abuses, and you are making a mockery of the integrity of your own position on human rights. Regarding Turkey’s statement that they would freeze EU ties when Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency, I would ask the High Representative: why is the EU negotiating membership with a country that is acting in such a bullying manner? Although, on second thoughts, the High Representative might agree that such a country would fit perfectly into the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I would like to give my thanks and congratulations to Mr Vaughan for this report as well as my commendation to him for becoming the King Canute of the 21st century, although King Canute would have had a much easier task in stemming the sea than the task of stemming the tide of EU expenditure. In the middle of an economic and financial crisis and ongoing national budget and consolidation efforts, the EU just does not want to see sense. It does not want to actually reverse expenditure but wants a freeze on inflation, which is probably still an increase. What we actually need is to withdraw expenditure and save taxpayers’ money. It needs to be by independent assessment. You have the daily allowances of EUR 304 and there will be a significant number of MEPs – and some MEPs I see in this place right now – who sign in on a Friday in Strasbourg when there is no official business, stealing taxpayers’ money. That should stop. Office allowances are only required to be 50% receipted. That should be 90% receipted and they should be independently audited, as mine is independently audited. If that money is not properly spent, it should be returned. The House of History is a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money that should be stopped. End this extravagance and return taxpayers’ money. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, on a point of order, in the previous debates on human rights, I had a timed speech and I also had a blue card, but you refused me a second blue card. But we had the previous speaker who had a timed speech and a blue card, and you also gave him a catch-the-eye. I would also note that the PPE Group here has had several catch-the-eye speakers, even though I was the very first person to make a request. You need to have equality here. If you talk about equality and democracy, at least give some pretence of it in this Chamber. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I am pleased to support any initiative that empowers and enables physically disadvantaged people, in this case, the blind and partially sighted. The EU has been, in my opinion, insensitive to the needs of millions of blind and partially-sighted people. All Member States and relevant institutions should make the strongest possible representations to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva in June for a full, binding treaty. This is the best way to ensure the fundamental right to read that is currently denied to far too many – apparently 300 million worldwide. Put an end to this famine. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question.

 Mr President, I have a question for my colleague, a Danish Member, about the European financial transaction tax, which the Danish Prime Minister says they want to introduce very swiftly. Does he agree with the Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, Margrethe Vestager, who said it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, or maybe he may agree with Lene Espersen, the former Danish Foreign Minister, who described the tax as ‘bullshit’? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, the Prime Minister is taking on the Presidency of the EU at a time when unacceptable behaviour threatens democratic principles. Such behaviour has become endemic and institutionalised in the European Union. In recent months we have seen elected leaders being bullied out of office and replaced by unelected technocrats, by an over-dominant German leader and her French poodle. With a possible new treaty on the way, the EU apparatchiks are desperately looking for a new way to include all 27 countries without the need for a referendum. So much for democracy. No wonder people across Europe are rioting. The message is there for all to see, but the EU turns its head away. Prime Minister, you again hold the Presidency at a decisive moment: the possible demise of the euro. At a time of crisis and uncertainty the EU is looking to the Danish Presidency for a strong lead. How telling it is that a country from outside the eurozone is taking the helm. The EU is looking to the IMF to help bail out the troubled euro. How telling it is that the UK, a country from outside the eurozone, ridiculed and threatened here in December, has been asked to prop up the IMF at this time. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, it has come to my attention that there is an increasing trend with regard to written declarations in this Parliament for children to be used.

 Madam President, I have grave concerns about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and I voted against this report. I have looked at the history of this report and noticed that the French car firms in particular, both Renault and Peugeot, as well as Dutch companies and German companies are great recipients of this for people they have made redundant. I am minded of my own constituents in Coventry, the Peugeot Ryton plant, where over 2 000 people were made redundant in 2007 without receiving any assistance or training whatsover. Indeed the Labour government or the current Conservative-led government in the UK has made no claims or put anything into retraining these people or other people whatsoever. There was also this week an EGF in favour of the Südtirol region of Italy, where the Member here, Mr Dorfmann, says that unemployment is just 3%. Yet we gave EUR 3.9 million to that project. Why? Why are we not training people where we do have serious unemployment but just throwing money away to a region where unemployment is only 3%? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, you, I and the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, are, according to Ms Sargentini, from the ‘plus one’. Well, let us hope that is ‘minus one’, and according to most of this Chamber, you will probably be most happy. I welcome the strong approach taken in this report; it is right and proper that transparency is given its correct importance. I am unsurprised by Mr Cashman wanting this because for the pro-Europeans in the UK, it is becoming a much more difficult job trying to sell the European Union and the secrecy of the European Union: its unaudited accounts or unsuccessfully audited accounts have, for many years, been a difficult sell within the UK. Something will need to be done. I would point out that it was the Labour government who brought in the Freedom of Information Act in 1997 in the UK and it ultimately caused them a lot of problems. I am unsurprised that they are hoping to put the Conservative Party in a difficult position in the Council, although they were very disingenuous when they were in power. I do sound a note of caution though on what I hear from the Commission, which is that they have no intention of being transparent, nor does the EPP when they are talking about undermining institutions and about a legitimate report. Who will decide what a legitimate report is? They will never allow transparency because they do not want it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague, who mentions the deplorable conditions in some EU detention centres, whether she would join my colleague, the Earl of Dartmouth, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Today, we have applauded with a standing ovation the Sakharov Prize. How can we talk about human rights in one vein, and be very sanctimonious and supportive of it, when, in the European Union itself, we have detention standards that are below common decency for human beings? Will she join me, and everyone else, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, I think Mr Murphy has summed this up perfectly; he talks about words and actions and that is what lies before us here. That is the decision that we have to make, or the Commission has to make. This is a question of values and puts into sharp focus Baroness Ashton’s assertion yesterday that human rights will be a thread in all the EU does. As has been said many times here, Uzbekistan is the third largest exporter of cotton worldwide; almost half that cotton is picked by state-sponsored forced child labour. Children suffer appalling conditions during the cotton harvest. Many contract hepatitis from insanitary conditions, and there have even been reports of police throwing stones at children who were not picking cotton because they were sick. So far, the European Union has failed to take action on this issue, but it is clear from all parts of this Chamber that this is an issue of importance that needs immediate attention. I would like to see a plan from the Commission, not rhetoric. Suspension of GSP would be a good start. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I sympathise with my Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues. They are right that there is no European consistency or social cohesion in this matter, but this is a flaw within the EU. Yes, there is discrimination, but fairness has different sides. My constituency of the West Midlands in the UK – and the UK has been mentioned, along with the Netherlands, as one of the countries that wants to prolong this exclusion – has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. We need to provide jobs for those people. When the first wave of Eastern bloc countries joined the European Union, the UK was one of the very few countries that did not impose restrictions, and the then Labour government said that 14 000 people from Poland and elsewhere would come into the UK. That 14 000 turned into over 850 000. That put an extreme demand on our social services: on our social housing, on our National Health Service and on our social security. The British taxpayer simply could not afford it. Earlier today, we heard the United Kingdom being called ‘26 plus one’. Well, it has the right to defend its own borders and to defend its own economy. We will remain that ‘plus one’ and, hopefully, will soon not even be that ‘plus one’ and will be leaving. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Vigenin for his question. Yes, of course, they are taxpayers, but what we are talking about here is the fact that, while they were paying tax, there was a British person who was unemployed because that job was taken, so that was a strain on our social security system. The United Kingdom is, simply, a small island. It is not about race, it is about space: we simply do not have enough jobs. I would like to see a points system in the United Kingdom, whereby we have people from outside the European Union and people from within the European Union as well, so that we can fill the vacancies we actually have. There is no point bringing workers in from around the European Union when we simply do not have the jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card answer. 
– Madam President, I do not have the statistics to hand but I have read several reports since 2005 and it is there for people to see in the United Kingdom. We can see this. We could see in 2006 and 2007 the demand on social housing, the demand on our health service and the demand on social security. Child benefit is paid for every child in the UK, and there were examples of workers from Eastern bloc countries claiming this money for children still resident in the Eastern bloc. That was the demand on British taxpayers. There is obviously an economic benefit from migrant workers to the UK. The UK has benefited from migration since the Second World War, from our own old Empire and Commonwealth countries. We need a certain level of immigration, but it needs to be controlled immigration under our terms, not your terms. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Ms Ţicău, you mentioned that we are either in this or out of this, but the Treaty of Rome actually says that for any kind of changes, especially to any Treaties, you need unanimity. But the European Union changes the rules as it goes along do you not? The British Prime Minister vetoed a new treaty last week, but you are going ahead with the rest of the 26 of you. Where does unanimity come in there? There are rules when they suit you and rules when they do not suit you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I was in Afghanistan less than three weeks’ ago, in Helmand Province, visiting the British forces that are part of the International Security Assistance Force or ISAF. It is an interesting situation there, and there are many fears for post-2014, but since the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, there has been a 60% increase in health care provision, with infant mortality reduced by 20%. Education has increased – obviously including females – with 13 000 more schools, 170 000 more teachers and 7.3 million more students. These are things that we need to build on. I am glad – amazed actually – that the European Parliament is having this debate here tonight and actually showing some concern about where the money goes. This makes a welcome change from previous years. We must continue to help Afghanistan build, because it was a factory of terrorism. The UK, other Member States and the international community need to show faith with Afghanistan to build a strong and prosperous country that rejects terrorism and all the disasters that go with it.

– Mr President, Mr Cameron stated in Westminster yesterday that only two options confronted him at last week’s summit: a new treaty without the negotiated safeguards for Britain or no treaty at all. He rightly chose no treaty. But with this failure, he left his and the Conservative Party’s EU policy in tatters. He mistakenly and naively promised the British people that he could repatriate powers from the EU, and that he could safeguard British interests. But such negotiations are not possible with the European Union, a Union that blatantly and negligently disregards sensible economic rules. You even broke your own rules in the Maastricht criteria just so that your beloved political project of European federalisation could move one step further. In your negligent actions, you cause financial hardship for people across Europe, people you constantly ignore in referendums. You deny them even the opportunity to have their say. To protect our interests, my country was right not to go along with your economic negligence. Even Ms Harms said that the summit denied reality and denied democracy. The British Prime Minister, having had his electoral pledge on renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU undermined and discredited, has finally faced up to the inevitable by refusing to have any part in the latest doomed rescue plan. Mr Cameron’s EU policy of negotiation is now in tatters and only a referendum on Britain’s future membership of the EU is a viable solution. Democratic integrity demands nothing less. The British people demand nothing less. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, as Ms Willmott knows, I am no big fan of Mr Cameron, but I think it is very disingenuous for a Labour politician to come here after 13 years of a Labour government where you deceived and distorted the European issue to the British people. You promised referendum after referendum but you failed to deliver one and called it whatever you wanted in order not to have it. I think Mr Cameron has to deal with the mess of 13 years of Labour policy towards the EU. But here is my question. You mentioned about the Labour Party supporting the European Union but we have a party in government, the Liberal Democrats, that is actually currently supporting the Conservatives. Will you then call for the Liberal Democrats to withdraw from the coalition and force a general election so that we can have a proper debate on the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I rise under Rule 173. I wonder, do you share my concern at the level of xenophobia that was experienced in this Chamber this morning towards Britain? It is an absolute disgrace. A chair of a group, Mr Verhofstadt, and I quote, said, ‘when you are invited to dinner, you are either invited as a guest or as a main course’. Could he explain whether that was a threat and what did he mean exactly by that comment? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the title ‘Fourth Railway Package’ really says it all for me, and that is that the EU is just no good at overseeing the railways of Europe.  UKIP, my party, has been voting against this so-called harmonisation for 15 years now, because we know it is difficult in the UK. We have a Victorian network, the oldest in the world, but quite why Brussels needs to harmonise the trains of the UK, which is an island, with the rest of the continent, is anyone’s guess. HS1 and the Channel Tunnel were financial disasters, with shares crashing and people losing huge amounts of money. But now we have HS2, because the European Union tells us we have to do so.  In 2002 the EU took the British Government to court because we were failing to fulfil our obligations under the Trans-European rail system Directive and now we have High Speed Rail 2 (HS2). The EU-sponsored HS2 will be costly, pointless and unfair, because it will punish the many to benefit the few, and I guarantee that those few will be the rich few.  If HS2 were such a good idea, then the business community would come up with the money, but of course they will not because they know it is just another expensive EU vanity project. Therefore the bill for this drive for harmonisation will fall on the British taxpayer and that, I believe – and my party believes – is grossly unfair, unneeded, unwanted, and that is why we are committed to scrapping HS2.

 Mr President, late last year, I brought up in this Chamber the case of a British ski instructor called Simon Butler. Mr Butler is trying to ply his trade in France at the moment, but he is being hounded by the French authorities, who claim that his qualifications do not meet their requirements, which is blatantly untrue and they know it.  I finished my speech by asking for a meeting with Commissioner Barnier to clear up this matter, which he kindly agreed to. On 20 January, Mr Butler and I met the Commissioner, and Mr Butler now has a memorandum of understanding from Commissioner Barnier, which should mean that he can ply his trade without trouble, without problems and without being harangued and harassed by the French authorities. So you can understand why we were a bit shocked last week when Mr Butler was locked up in a cell for 36 hours for absolutely no reason. It just goes to show that it is a farce. We in Britain stick to the rules and we comply with the single market, but the French do not. It is a disgrace. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, for the first time in my life I must congratulate the rapporteur. I know that this seems surreal coming from a member of UKIP, but I really do think that my British colleague is on to something here. Work permits, rights of residence: seems perfectly good stuff to me. In fact it sounds like the UKIP manifesto. However, where the report falls down is that these sensible proposals only apply to third-country nationals who want to come to the EU for seasonal work.  My proposal is that it should apply to all citizens within the EU but, sadly, EU freedom of movement, which is supported by all the British political parties except my own, prevents this from happening. At the moment in the UK we have 2.4 million people unemployed. That is less than some of the other countries within the EU, but it is still an appalling statistic. Indeed, worryingly, we have 20% youth unemployment and in some parts of my constituency, such as Salford, it is running at up to 40%. Many of these young people cannot find jobs because the employment market has been saturated by a huge influx of Eastern European workers who are prepared to work for less money.   The way to solve this problem is by applying Mr Moraes’ report to the whole of the EU, and then we can get back to controlling our own borders. But of course his own party, the Labour Party, would never support this. The European elections which are coming later this year are going to be dominated by the issue of immigration, and I am happy to say that my party, UKIP, is the only political party in Britain which has a firm, but fair, sensible policy in this area. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

Madam President, the civil protection mechanism means in effect civil protection money, but the European Union does not have any money; it belongs to the nation states. What the EU is doing is taking money from Member States and then handing it back, repackaged as the European Union. This is taking with one hand and giving with the other. It is little more than kidology. This is a desperate effort to get the citizens of Europe to love the European Union at a time when its popularity has hit rock bottom.  I am not opposed to helping out people who need help in times of natural disasters – fires, floods and earthquakes can completely wreck societies. We have seen this recently in the Philippines, where the aid has come in. Look at what the British have done: the UK Government has given GBP 60 million, provided planes, helicopters and ships, and the British people have provided GBP 70 million in donations. So this is proof that we already give aid when natural disasters occur. What we do not have to do is to filter it through the European Union for the EU to use as propaganda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, well we have finally made it, haven’t we? Agonising negotiations, budget cuts, budgets rises, tears, tantrums and vetoes that never were. So what are we left with? Well, we are left in the UK with us paying GBP 53 million a day into an organisation that has not had its accounts signed off for 19 years! So no change there then.  The EU has even tried to hide the bad press. Mr Van Rompuy threatened the Court of Auditors to give the accounts a clean bill of health. But even then there were more errors, so that means even more taxpayers’ money lost for ever. Last month we had an emergency vote to raise EUR 2.7 billion or, we were told, the EU would shut down like the USA. Of course, our friends the Conservatives did not even have the bottle to vote against this, and abstained, in another stunning victory for Mr Cameron: whilst we have cuts at home, more money for the European Union.  Do not be fooled by this agreement: it is merely papering over the cracks. Because next year the dam will burst at the European elections and in my country UKIP will be riding on the crest of an anti-EU wave. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, we frequently hear that the EU gives us the right to live and work in other countries, but allow me to tell you about Simon Butler, a British ski instructor who was arrested, handcuffed, and dragged off the slopes in front of his class as if he were a common criminal. Had he committed a crime? No. His only crime was that the French did not think his qualifications were good enough. We are talking about a man who easily qualifies as a UK instructor, so why were his qualifications not recognised? This is unfair. We are not talking about a criminal: we are talking about a law-abiding citizen whom the French ski and police authorities clearly want to victimise. I have asked Commissioner Barnier to meet me and discuss this issue and I await his response. Paul Nuttall,

Mr President, unlike many people in this Chamber I have actually been to a Roma camp in Bulgaria. That is me in a place called Fakulteta, which has up to 50 000 people living in slums in a square mile. And I saw conditions there of poverty and deprivation that one rarely sees outside sub-Saharan Africa. If I were forced to live like this, and you were forced to live this, you would seize any chance to leave, and that is what many will do on 1 January next year and many will be headed to the UK.  Some are coming to do honest work, we know that, but some will not. Sadly there are gangmasters within the Roma community who force children to work as everything such as pickpockets and prostitutes. This is already happening in other European countries and in January it will happen in the UK as well. So, centuries after social reformers in Britain stopped child prostitution and put a stop to Dickensian pickpocket gangs, the EU will foist them upon us once again.  There will be a backlash, trust me, and our government will not and cannot do anything about it because of the European Union’s laws. The best way, I believe, to help these people is not to export them round Europe: it is for their own national governments to do what our people did a long time ago and take the fight to child abusers who force them to work as career criminals.

Of course I think this obligation is completely wrong. We have 22 % of our own young people in the UK out of work. That is a million people unemployed. All that will happen when we open up the borders on 1 January 2014 to 29 million more people is that they will saturate the job market. It is about economics, it is nothing to do with racism and, quite frankly, we are only a small island and we cannot cope as it is. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -   
Madam President, I think the last debate on the subject of the Roma people really sums up why we are in the situation whereby extremism is on the march. People like the unelected Commissioner here just live on another planet. They are out of touch with public opinion. Your two flagship policies – the single currency and open borders – are creating a perfect breeding ground for the far right. Take Greece for example. The result of them being trapped in a catastrophic currency union has led to the rise of Golden Dawn. The austerity measures imposed by the European Union have driven large numbers of people in the cradle of democracy into the arms of extremists. Yet you still do not listen. If you want to know why the far right are on the march right across Europe, Commissioner, you have to do nothing else but look in the mirror. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, usually when I get up and criticise EU directives I can see a logic to them. It is usually a twisted and bad logic, but there is still a logic. There are a number of areas in this report which I believe actually defy logic. Firstly, the banning of tens. To me it makes no sense. You are not going to stop people smoking by banning 10 cigarettes. What you are going to do is encourage them to buy 20. So in effect what we are doing is, we are criticising places like McDonalds for supersizing their product but we are encouraging the tobacco industry to do the same. And all it will do is make poor people poorer. As regards the menthol cigarettes issue, a million people in the UK smoke menthol cigarettes. They are not going to stop overnight if you ban them, they will go to conventional cigarettes and you will increase the size of the black market.  Finally, e-cigarettes: e-cigarettes are proving, according to latest research, to be the most effective way of stopping people from smoking. Therefore, why on earth would you make them medicinal? Why would you make it harder to stop people smoking? I would ask my colleagues please to vote against this. It is ill-thought out, it is counterproductive and it is contradictory. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, this Directive might sound dull, but it boasts that it is the jewel in the crown of EU environmental policy. Now if any phrase should send a shiver down everyone’s spine, it’s that. It is massive. It rules 200 types of projects – everything from building bridges to new motorways, to rearing pigs and rearing poultry – and, strangely, the same document also admits that it gives rise to a large number of disputes. Well, that is not surprising because who among us really enjoys red tape when it gets in the way of our own lives?  Now it is the turn of shale gas. Everything must be regulated and nothing must escape. Well, in the North-West of England, we are sitting on possibly the biggest deposits of shale in the whole of Europe and all we want is to be left alone to move on and frack, to produce shale, as what it will do is give us cheap energy and a boom in jobs. Paul Nuttall,

 Madam President, in southern Europe we hear horror stories of 60% youth unemployment in Greece and Spain. In my own country we have a million young people out of work. Why is this happening? It is happening because EU rules and regulations on employers are making it difficult and expensive for them to hire young people. That is one point, but let us talk about the real elephant in the room here. The other problem is the fact that we have been forced to open our borders to 500 million people across the European Union. They have every right to come and work in the UK, to undercut young people and drive down wages. In a few months’ time, on 1 January 2014, we will be opening our borders to 29 million more people from Romania and Bulgaria, two countries which are far poorer than the UK. Already statistics are showing that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has risen by 26% this year. So here we are, debating the EU strategy. Well, I can tell you it is a failure and will continue to be a failure until the European Union allows us to implement sensible border controls. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

Mr President, the EU is finally coming to its senses about biofuels and reversing its policies. Hopefully, it will not be too little, too late. My party, UKIP, has opposed since day one subsidies for crops that grow oil rapeseed for biofuel instead of wheat for bread. It is practically taking food off the plate and putting it into the petrol tank. The EU is seeking to cut subsidies for biofuel. We in UKIP would like to see them abolished altogether. What we want is to end this ugly spectacle of farmers reaping subsidies instead of food crops. The price of food in Manchester in my constituency goes up and the price of food in Morocco and Mozambique also goes up, all because of the EU’s wrong-minded policies. A report by the EU Joint Research Centre shows that the price of vegetable oil and other foods would be halved in Europe if we ended biofuels and had no subsidies. These subsidies are the hard-earned taxes of the UK taxpayer. We would all rather keep that cash in our pockets rather than throw it away on biofuel subsidies. Now here is the real point. Many say that this is all in aid of fighting so-called global warming due to man-made carbon emissions. This is increasingly discredited as a climate theory. Figures only released this week show that the world has not warmed for 20 years. Indeed, only in this year the Arctic ice cap has increased by 60%, which proves that it is as likely to grow as it is to shrink. So let us just admit it. EU biofuels and the subsidies are all about buying farmers’ votes and wielding power. They are not about putting power in fuel tanks at all.

Mr Ashworth, you have not listened to me or else you are partially hard of hearing. I did not say we are going to outlaw anything: I said we should do away with subsidies. Quite frankly, this is British taxpayers’ money. This is pushing up the price of food and it is wrong. We are in the middle of a recession and I put it to you that I would rather the price of food be reduced than line the pockets of rich farmers in the UK – and actually not just the UK but right across Europe. Biofuels are a failed experiment. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, Commissioner. This food legislation, known in the trade as Parnuts, is fortunately not as dangerous as it sounds. A year ago, UKIP voted to repeal the amendment of sports nutrition supplements from the scope of this regulation, and for once we were successful. A bit less power for the European Commission and all its unnecessary quangos is the way that we see it.  Naturally, this small victory for common sense was not based on the Commission or the Environment Committee scaling back their ambition, but on the successful lobbying of ESSNA, a small but dynamic alliance of sports nutrition companies made up of two dozen small but innovative companies – primarily from the UK – which export sports drinks and protein bars. It was the culmination of years of handiwork on their part. It is nice to reward such efforts and win a vote – even such a small vote. However, I would prefer this legislation to be made at national level. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, on the face of it, and listening to this debate, I must say that shale gas is probably the most exciting development in the sphere of energy since the discovery of North Sea oil. It will benefit my own region in particular because we in the North West of England are sitting on 4.6 trillion cubic feet of shale, which means that we have the largest shale reserves in Europe. This could provide energy for the UK for up to 50 years and create tens of thousands of jobs in the North West of England. We also know from evidence in the United States that shale gas can reduce energy prices by up to 30%, which would be a welcome break for hard-working people in the UK in a time of recession. Lastly, shale gas can also provide us with much-needed energy security, because we can become more self-sufficient and not so reliant on the Middle East and Russia for our energy supply. Shale gas would bring more jobs, cheaper energy prices and energy security. To me it seems obvious that shale must form a central part of any of our future energy policies.

 Let us not call them earthquakes because they are not. They are tiny tremors, so let us have none of this green nonsense trying to blow things up and create scare stories. In May this year a government-appointed panel said that fracking is safe in the UK and we can move ahead with stricter legislation. In July the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineers also said that it will not contaminate water supplies, so there is an answer straight to your question. Let us not get caught up in green scare stories, because you have driven this debate on man-made climate change for too long with these scare stories and your green agenda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I must congratulate our colleague on coming round to the UKIP position. We have been saying for many years now that Greece would be better off leaving the euro and going back to the drachma. But this is not the position of his government and it is certainly not the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Does my colleague agree or disagree with the position of the British Government? Does he agree with the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that more fiscal union is needed and that Greece would be better off in the euro, or is his position completely different from that of his own government? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Madam President, figures show that the pay gap between men and women is still large. After all these years of EU gender equality regulations, targets, and initiatives, the situation is still pretty poor. And now you want to introduce quotas for women in boardrooms. To be perfectly honest, when I read it, I did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Because, if a women is dedicated and good she can get to the top. Did Margaret Thatcher need quotas to become the British Prime Minister? No, she did not. She did it based on raw ability, an iron will and because she was the best person for the job. When you bring in quotas you lessen quality. You promote mediocrity and I contend that businesses should have the right to hire the best person for the job and it should not matter whether they are male, female, black or white or anything else. It is called a meritocracy and it is something which Britain and the English-speaking peoples of the world have been pioneering for centuries. How would you feel, if you were a women who had worked very hard and had gone into management, only for a token woman to be handed a similar job? If anything, this will create a culture of discrimination. As colleagues will constantly ask, did you get there because you are good or did you get there because you ticked a few boxes? You call this positive discrimination. I contend that discrimination is never positive. So here we have it. In a desperate bid to sound popular you are not only patronising women, you are promoting mediocrity and you are hampering business. I would urge all Members to vote against this report tomorrow.

 If a woman is good enough, she will be promoted. It is as simple as that. What we should have is a situation where we are not hampering business with regulation in times of austerity. What we should be doing is ripping up red tape and allowing businesses to hire the best person for the job, not introducing even more ‘big state’ legislation and tying the hands of businesses. No, let us do the opposite. Let us deregulate and let us ensure that the best person for the job gets it, regardless of gender, colour, creed, religion or anything else. The best person should always get the job. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 No I would not; but I would not say that women would probably do a better job. Hang on – the greatest monarchs that we have ever had in our country have been women. Undoubtedly! Probably our greatest Prime Minister of the last century was a woman. It is as simple as that. But she got there – and the Labour Party probably does not like that fact, but there we are – purely on merit because she was the best person for the job. I tell you that, if you go down this line, all you are doing is tying the hands of businesses in times of austerity. It is wrong! You should deregulate. You should do away with red tape and give businesses the freedom to hire the people they want. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commission intends to impose a new interpretation of the weight and dimensions of HGVs to allow for cross-border traffic of mega trucks. This measure would allow mega trucks into the UK through the back door because in the end the government will surrender to a ruling on competition grounds. In making this decision, no research to assess the safety, congestion and pollution impact has been taken. In 2009 the Commission stated that mega trucks are more dangerous than standard HGVs. The Commission is not even waiting to analyse the public consultation, which only closed in February. Of course the Commission interpretation will become a minimum standard and so lorries could get bigger, even beyond the 25 metres. This will surely have a massive impact on safety and cost to the British taxpayer. For example, how many bridges up and down the country in the UK will have to be reinforced to accommodate these heavier loads? This just shows you the power that these unelected EU Commissioners have. No one voted for them, and yet they can make unilateral decisions, off the cuff, which will affect local areas and businesses right across the UK. Paul Nuttall,

– 
Mr President, this is essentially a commercial problem, and if action is needed, then it is a situation crying out to be addressed by the private sector acting in its own commercial interests, under the law. But instead we get this report, which has all the hallmarks of everything which is worst about the EU and the Commission in particular, because it is going to be done using taxpayers’ money. I thought there was a crisis on. I thought we were living in a time of austerity necessitated by excessive government debt but, as ever, the taxpayer will be required to provide money that he or she can ill afford. The Commission likes to pretend that this will not require any extra resources, but I am more likely to believe that a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. We are creating and extending a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies always set out to justify themselves by showing both the massive scale of the problem and the need for more complex solutions. You can see it in this report and in the proposed legislation. It states facts which can only be conjecture. It is telling that you cannot be precise, or even necessarily in the right ballpark, when assessing grey economic activity. I do not see any proof that this new extension of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will either save EUR 10 billion or 185 000 jobs, yet that is the claim. To paraphrase Mandy Rice-Davies, ‘they would say that, wouldn’t they?’ Before I could back any of the proposals such as this, I would require some kind of guarantee that this would work and save the taxpayer money. I do not want to be unkind, but is it not nice for the office to be put in Alicante? You would think that an office like this would be put in an established commercial centre or a place associated with innovation, entrepreneurship and growth, but it is placed on the Costa Blanca. It reminds me of the famous song ‘Oh we do like to live beside the seaside, oh we do like to live beside the sea’ because – come on, let us get real – we are once again seeing taxpayers’ money being thrown at ‘jobs for the boys’ corporatism. Where is the evidence for European consumers and taxpayers that they will be better off? That would be a real impact assessment, not the usual Commission approach of assuming what it seeks to prove. What we have here is the usual manifestation of the Commission’s proposals, because it will be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It will never, ever, be brought in at a saving to the taxpayer. It will become eventually, as all these things always do, another bureaucratic monster. It is no more than a proto-agency right now but, as ever, it will grow and it will grow. I predict that, sitting there by the Costa Brava beach, the office and its lucky bureaucrats will become bloated on sun, sangria and paella. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, paragraph 100 of this report clearly states that you would like to see the EU flag at major sporting events and on the jerseys of athletes. Are we now going to see the EU flag at the British Olympics, at the Champions League Final or even on the shirt of the England captain? This is nothing more than sheer EU propaganda and vanity. The EU has never been so unpopular, yet here you are, wanting to stamp your flag on sporting stars in the hope that you can force the people to love you. But they will not. What you propose also seems to break the rules of sporting competitions. For example, under Law 4, Decision 1 of the FIFA laws of the game, it states: ‘The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or FIFA.’ What right do you think the EU has to interfere in sport in such a way to encourage countries to break the rules? It is hypocritical, because the EU is in effect a political organisation. You even say in paragraph 20 of the report that political propaganda should be banned, which is hypocritical. Athletes proudly wear the flag of their own national countries. They should not wear the flag of the European Union.

Mr President, I would like to agree with my colleague. The EU is not a country; the EU is a false state. What is being created is something very dangerous, because false states like the Soviet Union only ever break up in one of two ways. They break up in peaceful divorce, like Czechoslovakia – which is the way in which I hope this organisation will break up – or in bloody revolution, like Yugoslavia – which I fear very much indeed. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the EU world view is that it knows best about everything, from global warming scare stories to food labels. But the truth is that it is the consumer who is paying and not the EU and the consumer will choose what he or she wants to eat. Of course, some kind of labelling is just common sense, whether it is nutritional information or allergies but I would suggest that much of this report is nannying in the excess. I also fear that it will come at a cost and that that cost will then be pushed onto the consumer, which seems to me to be particularly dangerous at a time of an economic downturn. But here is the crux and I repeat it in almost every speech I give. We all know that the UK can pass laws itself, indeed our parliament was known as the mother of parliaments for many years. This is a decision that should be taken at nation state level. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but, in my experience, that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation, because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it. Let us be frank. This is about – and I quote – ‘air emissions and environmental taxes’, just as the last speaker said. So the Sovietisation of the EU continues. The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and – let us be honest – you want this data to tax and control, which explains your thirst for ever more statistics. The worst thing of all is that this is a regulation, not a directive. Regulations are far worse than directives because they pass into UK law and bypass the UK Parliament. This is very dangerous and, my friends, this is the way democracy dies. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, let me make the first point. The fact of the matter is that this place likes to control things from the centre. Let us also make another point, that none of the Commissioners are actually elected by the people. Democracy matters for the whole of Europe so, yes, I do believe that we are seeing a Sovietisation of Europe. The fact of the matter is that these decisions should be taken at Member State level. The fact that regulations can bypass my own parliament, can bypass the people who were elected by the British people, is an absolute disgrace and, yes, it is the Sovietisation of Europe. Paul Nuttall,

– Mr President, my father is a small businessman. He owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the Conservative Prime Minister and true Eurosceptic, Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s. Like all small businessmen, he is overburdened with red tape and regulation – much of it emanating from this place, the European Parliament. My father’s small business remains small. However, these kinds of businesses are the bedrock of the British economy and they amount to a staggering 73% of all businesses in the UK. My father drives a van, and like many small businesses, he is struggling due to the recession. I have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father’s out of business for ever, because we are told that this legislation will, in fact, put up to EUR 5 000 on the price of vans. Small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife. The gentleman from the Socialists said that this is a good day for climate change policy in the EU. However, if this goes through, I guarantee it will be a bad day for small businessmen across the continent. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, again, this place shows absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in the real world. People are struggling out there, and what this legislation does – and it has been made quite clear to us – is put up the cost of small vans which are driven by many small businessmen across the continent. It will put it up by at least EUR 5 000. That is totally and utterly wrong, and it is something that we can ill afford in a time of recession. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, does the right honourable gentleman really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will, in effect, push up the cost of vehicles? He knows it will, and I know it will. In effect, what it will be doing is putting small firms in Liverpool and Manchester – in his own constituency – out of business. Does he think that is fair? Does he think it is morally correct? Is he prepared to stand on that platform in the elections in three years’ time? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Madam President, mobile phones, phone chargers, play stations, cameras, saunas, thermometers, refrigerators, freezers, toasters, kettles, microwaves, irons, air fresheners, clocks, watches, electric toothbrushes, DVD players, vacuum cleaners, children’s toys, video games, medical devices, televisions, remote controls, calculators, heaters, tumble dryers and washing machines. Well, that is just to name a few, because all of these appliances and many more will undoubtedly rise in price as a result of this waste directive. And to think that the European Union is prepared to pile this legislation on just at a time when we are in the depths of a recession and when people are struggling to make ends meet! I therefore encourage everyone in this Chamber to show sympathy with the hardworking taxpayers and with small-to-medium-sized businesses and put this prospective law in the waste bin. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I too enjoy my jousts with Mr Davies. It seems that we have these little jousts on every speech that I give. He knows as well as I do where the cost will lie – it will end up with the taxpayer having to fund this. At the moment, we are in the depths of a recession the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s. I am standing up for hardworking taxpayers. Secondly, the real point here is that this should be done at national level by people – by politicians – who are accountable to the electorate, not by a Commission that meets in secret and is accountable to nobody. That is the key. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, first of all I will repeat what I just said. We all know where the cost ends up – where it always does. It does not necessarily have to say it in the directive, because it never does. You never tell people that you are going to put up tax. You never tell people that you are going to hit them in the pocket. In my country, for example, it costs us GBP 50 million a day to be members of this club. The key to all of this is – and I go back to exactly what I said to Mr Davies – decisions should be made at nation-state level by politicians who are accountable to the electorate. The electorate of my country, Great Britain, cannot remove Commissioners. That is fundamentally undemocratic and wrong. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I support the protection of victims. However, when I first came across the European Protection Order, I thought it sounded scary, like the European Arrest Warrant, which, in my opinion, is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people. The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women. We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism – and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that. Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law. If proof were needed, we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant. I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK, for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life. We have a saying in England: ‘once bitten, twice shy’. We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant. I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I hope everyone enjoyed Cancún. It is a lovely place but I am a bit disappointed to see that none of them has a suntan. Well, I suppose that is to be expected really because, while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming, it was actually the coldest week that Mexican city had seen for over a hundred years. Back in the UK, we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest Novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming. Do these people think we were born yesterday? This also explains why even more British people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control. But what have you actually achieved in Cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers’ money in the guise of the Green Climate Fund, which I suggest will end up being a lucky bag for African dictators to buy themselves more Mercedes Benzes and private jets? Personally, I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed, and I think the ‘Politics of Envy Fund’ would be better and closer to the truth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– You are giving the game away there, because what you are talking about is world governments, politicians. We are talking about scientists here. Science is a slow process, evidence has to be studied and deciphered, but politics is a quicker game and politics is running ahead of the science; that is where the problem lies. The fact of the matter is that the globe is actually not warming; it has not warmed since 1998. So the game is up, people are finding out that you have a problem. What you are doing is conning people; it is a scam and the people are finding you out. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. 
– Madam President, one of the totems of a sovereign state is that it controls who can and who cannot come into its own country. Unfortunately, several governments in the UK have given away this power to unelected, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels. What a disaster it has proven to be. We have a situation now where we have uncontrolled EU immigration into our country, which has resulted in wages being driven down and people – indigenous people – being put out of work. I do not believe that this EU immigration liaison officers’ network has any power to stop this happening at all. We also have a two-tier immigration system in our country whereby if you are from Australia or New Zealand or anywhere else, you have a cap. However, if you are from Latvia or Poland or any of the EU countries, you can come to our country willy-nilly. This is fundamentally wrong. It is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration, but what happens if a country like Romania, for example, basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants? What it does is it makes a mockery of the whole system. I support elected politicians in the UK having control over our own borders. What I do not support are unaccountable, unelected appointees. I believe that the strengthening of this network would not be necessary if each individual Member State had the power to control who does and who does not come onto its lands. I therefore implore everybody to reject this report. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, if doctors and dentists and people like that want to come to the UK to work – and we need their skills – then by all means they should come, but what we have at the moment is a situation where our market is saturated: we cannot control who comes from the EU and who does not. This is fundamentally wrong. It is bad and it is putting people out of work. I shall give you an example. The taxi driver who drove me to the airport this morning was a bricklayer who has been laid off as a result of Polish people coming onto the site, undercutting British workers, and now he is driving a taxi. That cannot be right. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, ‘biodiversity’ is a word I often hear bandied about by Eurocrats, MEPs and lobbyists out here in Brussels. But I wonder if anybody in here can actually define what it really means, because I bet my bottom dollar that none of you can. Oddly enough, I think it does matter that you understand what you are talking about if you are making laws for the whole of the EU. But what does the conveniently vague and ambiguous term ‘biodiversity’ actually mean? Because the truth of the matter is that there is no correct number of species, whether it is on a Cumbrian farm or a Liverpool suburb or even in a Cheshire forest, and I defy the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to come up with a proper definition or stop using such ragbag words. And, may I ask, where is the boundary of the biodiverse area? Is it ever applied to offshore marine environments? And if so, why are you so keen to build monstrous wind farms that are detrimental to wildlife and do not even work! Let us be frank, you have not got a clue. There is no clear thinking, no coherent policy and no logic to what you are proposing. If you are going to preach, which is what you are doing, look in the mirror first, sort your own house out and let us start with the disaster which is the common fisheries policy. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, let us put a few facts in order. If you want examples of species which are disappearing, there are a lot of dodgy statistics out there – take polar bears as an example. People constantly say that the polar bear population has fallen. Yet the polar bear population is actually bigger now than it was in the 1940s. I agree that species are disappearing, but I do not believe that the European Union – which is fundamentally undemocratic, the British people have never had a say on it – is the forum to decide this matter. It should be done in nation states. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– The amendment allows the many people in the EU, and the MEPs who represent them, to signal their unhappiness and opposition to Turkish membership and the concomitant political union. However, we do not want this to be at the expense of supporting free trade with Turkey – and without tariff barriers – so much of the report is unchanged. Many choices are invidious: free trade agreements allow tariff barriers. Customs unions eliminate them internally but continue to allow and even erect them externally. And, of course, customs unions limit and prohibit members’ freedom of commercial negotiation. Despite these concerns about customs unions as a concept, in the context of Turkey’s circumstances, we are accepting that part of the report’s content relating to the customs union because it allows those against full Turkish EU membership to register their vote. It should be noted that in the event, only 38 MEPs out of 736 put their vote against Turkey entering Political Union. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I must say that it is quite enthusing to see that there are so many MEPs who treat this place with the contempt I do. Out of the 736, there are fewer than 30 of them here – which is under five percent – and it is half four on a Tuesday afternoon. As usual, EU rules and regulations are running out of control. But that is nothing compared to the rats and mice that will run out of control when the EU takes away common rat poison from ordinary householders. This is what Amendment 243 of this report will do. This daft piece of legislation will ensure that only professionals will be allowed to put down rat poison, which is freely available in shops. So, if rats are in your front garden, spreading their diseases and chewing everything up, the ordinary UK householder will be forced to wait for the Council rat catcher or have to pay for Rentokil. We are already told that you are never further than 20 yards away from a rat in a city centre in the UK. This piece of crazy legislation will only make things worse. To put this into perspective, this is a piece of bureaucracy for a rat poison that has been safely used by ordinary folk for the past 30 years – not only in the UK, but across Europe and in the USA. I will finish by asking a question. Why are you doing this? Do you want more vermin? Do you want more disease? Or is it just about control and your obsession with trying to govern every single aspect of our lives? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I would like to bring to this House’s attention a riddle which seems to be confusing MEPs from my own region in the North-West of England. In November 2009, Cumbria, which is in the northern part of my constituency, was hit by serious flooding. Homes were destroyed, businesses were ruined and sadly, a life was lost. As a result of the disaster, the British Government had every right to apply for the EU Solidarity Fund for assistance, and I am led to believe that the money which could have come in aid could have been up to GBP 100 million. Bizarrely, however, the British Government failed to apply. The people of Cumbria are honest folk. They work hard and they pay their taxes and a good portion of that is sent out to Brussels. Therefore, I believe that they have the right to ask for some of their money back, and I consider it a failure of the Labour Government that it failed to act on this issue. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I am increasingly concerned about the way local councils in my constituency in the North West of England are using car parking charges to top up their revenue. Take the small town of Congleton, for example, which is a local semi-rural community. The introduction of car parking charges will severely damage local industry and a fall-off in trade will result in a loss of revenue, forcing already hard-pressed SMEs into bankruptcy and possible closure. People are blaming the British Government, some blame the Unitary Council and others point the finger at the town council but, as always, the dark hand of the European Union lies in the background, for they are all working towards the framework set out in the EU’s European transport policy for 2010. You see, this is the genius of the EU: it is always one person removed. Whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections, the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of Brussels does not appear on the radar. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, please allow me to speak frankly as one Lancastrian to another, because this is not going very well, is it? It really is not. Earlier on, Baroness Ashton, you said that Europe needs a credible foreign policy. How can we have a credible foreign policy when it has an incredible High Representative? You seem as if you are stumbling from one crisis to another, so much so that the British Foreign Secretary had to write you a letter this week asking you to buck up, to get on your game. But we in UKIP were on to this from the start. We opposed your appointment because we said you would be clearly out of your depth – and we are being proved right. It was said that your appointment, made by the Commission, would stop the traffic in Tokyo and Washington. But you have not even been able to appoint the Ambassador to Washington because old Barroso did you up like a kipper! It is also claimed in the British press that you do not turn your phone on after 8 p.m. at night. But, Baroness Ashton, you are the highest-paid female politician in the world. You are paid more than Frau Merkel, you are paid more than Hillary Clinton: it is a 24-hour job. To top it all, yesterday it was reported that you are being provided with a Learjet. You are expected to do 300 000 miles per year. That would get you to the moon, and most people now would like you to stay there. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, contrary to the belief of the Commission, the debate regarding man-made climate change is far from over. In the past month alone, we have had the scandal of the University of East Anglia; then we have had the debacle over the Himalayan glaciers and now, we have got questions over the effect climate change will have on wildlife in the Amazon. Research has shown that at least 20 passages in the IPCC’s report cite non-peer-reviewed World Wildlife Fund or Greenpeace reports as authority. This is not science. We need solid, peer-reviewed scientific evidence, not the work of pressure groups using climate change to further their own agendas or politicians who use climate change to justify the existence of the European Union. I would like to ask whether it is now time to pause, to take stock and consider the ramifications of bounding ahead with policies that could damage economies, result in job losses or potentially result in energy chaos.

– While this report points to a rather less awful CFP than the monstrosity we have now, it nevertheless recommends leaving fisheries under the predatory control of the undemocratic and anti-democratic ‘European Union’, and, for this reason, cannot be endorsed by UKIP. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I requested to make this one-minute speech to highlight the terrible effect that fortnightly bin collections are having upon communities in my constituency in the north-west of England. Take my home town of Bootle, for example, where many families live in terraced houses with no front gardens and little space at the rear. It is crazy that they are forced to put out waste every two weeks. This, naturally, has caused pile-ups of rubbish, because there is no storage space. If we have a hot summer, you can be sure that this will lead to an increase in vermin, which in turn is a public health hazard. But why am I telling this House? Well, because fortnightly bin collections are the direct result of the EU’s Landfill Directive, which was supported in this Chamber by the British Labour Party and the Conservatives. I for one hope that a large number of British voters bear this in mind when they go to the polls in the general election later this year. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, may I first say that I have sympathy with the workers in Antwerp, but I would like to point out another couple of issues regarding the EU and General Motors. Spyker Cars becomes Saab Spyker in a EUR 400 million deal but, make no mistake, this is not a normal commercial deal where one company pays and another company is paid. This is a Commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy. Spyker pays, but using money from the European Investment Bank. In other words, the European taxpayer pays and the whole deal is underwritten by the Swedish Government. Of course, only the risk is underwritten. General Motors will still take a share of the profits and Saab Spyker will be obliged to buy fully assembled cars from another General Motors plant, one located in that well-known European nation of Mexico. Why are we saving jobs in Mexico with European taxpayers’ money? Can we not rebody Vectras at the Ellesmere Port plant in my constituency? For that is all Saab has been reduced to. And it is also common knowledge that General Motors and the European institutions have a special relationship. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pumped over EUR 160 million into General Motors’ operations in Russia and Ukraine, and it owns a 30% equity stake in the General Motors manufacturing plant in St Petersburg. So I would like to ask the Commission why such extravagant financial support is available to countries such as Ukraine and Mexico but is never available to British companies. Rover could have been saved for a fraction of the price, and jobs probably could have been saved at Rolls Royce in Netherton on Merseyside, in my constituency, but at the moment, General Motors jobs in my constituency in the north-west of England are still at risk and yet the Commission is using my constituents’ tax revenues to secure General Motors jobs in Mexico and Russia. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have recently heard that there is to be a closure of the Corus steel works on Teesside in northern England. This is due to an EU target reduction of 20% of carbon emissions. Thanks to the carbon credit, Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers, including suppliers. We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law. The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme, which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years. But surprise, surprise – guess what: the head of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, is also the head of the Tata Foundation, so, one must ask, cui bono
? Because Tata owns Corus. (Protests from the floor)
 The question I would like to ask is: is it now official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside so that they can outsource their business to countries such as India, or is there a more personal interest at stake here? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You did not answer my question, because the question was: is it official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside and outsource the business to countries such as India? You did not answer the question. Would you please answer it? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I have just heard a Socialist colleague over there talking about Greenland and the ice melting in Greenland. The question I would like to ask on this subject is: why is Greenland called Greenland? Is it perhaps because Greenland was once green when the world was hotter? It seems that the British people are onto this, because a recent opinion poll in The Times
 newspaper clearly shows that the British people no longer believe in so-called man-made global warming. The British people are very astute and they are clear that politicians have hijacked the environmentalist agenda. It is being cynically used to raise taxes, to exert control, and now it is being used by the European Union to justify its own existence. This week, we have also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate-research centres in the UK, which advises the government, being caught altering data and stifling debate. It is an absolute disgrace. I look forward to Copenhagen, when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room, which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past 10 years. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I would like to draw this assembly’s attention to the disastrous effect that the Biocides Directive is having across the UK. This punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine, which has been used to control the mole population in the UK for the past 70 years. This was the case until the EU got itself involved. As a result, mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate, which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business. But it gets worse. While strychnine kills a mole in up to 15 minutes, aluminium phosphate takes up to three days, ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death. This crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the UK, but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the UK is better off out. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union. The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or of my real parliament at Westminster. The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink. The people have been bypassed, but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people. Just take a look at what has happened with the Lisbon Treaty. It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue. They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee. To conclude, on the eve of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out all over Europe. Well done to the European Union, because, with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change, what you are doing is proving Sir Edward’s unfortunate prophecy to be correct. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. The Regulation restricts freedom of contract, grants powers to ESMA (including the power to prohibit investment products) and empowers the Commission to pass delegated acts and to adopt regulatory technical standards. Transparency in OTC dealings is all very well, but the volume of the information produced will be unmanageable within any reasonable time frame – rendering the process meaningless. EMIR regulates derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories in the European Union. The proposal creates new requirements to mitigate the risks associated with the derivatives markets, following the lessons from the financial crisis. It introduces new requirements for transparency, as well as organisational requirements and prudential standards for both CCPs and trade repositories. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This is a major piece of legislation, relating to financial services, and therefore has the potential to have a significant effect on the UK economy. The most fundamental change MiFID creates is to introduce competition into the EU trading landscape by providing a passport for trading venues and investment firms on the basis of authorisation in their home Member State.

 UKIP’s position is against. Extends the powers of the Commission. Has every appearance of a bland technical review aimed at improving existing flows of information.

 Mr President, I was speaking today primarily not as a UKIP MEP but as a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales. One fact is beyond dispute: the Court of Auditors has not passed the accounts of the European Union for the last 19 years. This is even though the Court has only to sign off a declaration of assurance, which is probably a lessor standard than the true and fair view of the Anglo-American world. This, then, is the context: the context of 19 years of unsigned accounts, in which this Parliament is now discussing own resources – and the conclusion is clear. The institutions of the European Union are unreformable, otherwise they would have been reformed back in 1994 – the first time that the accountants did not pass the test of the Auditors. This is a disgrace, and I hope that the next Parliament will do something about it because for sure this Parliament will not. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 You mentioned in your remarks that we should look at the impact of climate change on flooding. Have you ever considered the impact and consequent causes of EU directives on flooding? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Madam President, my constituents in the area known as the Somerset levels have suffered badly from flooding. This flooding is in large part the direct consequence of EU directives, especially the EU directive on wildlife. Money has gone on wildlife habitats, and routine maintenance and dredging – which is highly necessary – has been barred. People in the Somerset levels are prime candidates to benefit from EU solidarity funding. They should get back some of the disproportionate amount that we in the UK are paying to the EU. However, the UK’s coalition government has not even applied. This is an appalling decision, and I therefore ask two questions. First, what use is the coalition government? – and second, what is the purpose of Britain remaining in the EU? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. Whilst there may be occasions when a Parliament might properly instigate and inquire into some matter, this Parliament is unlikely to do that effectively. There have hitherto been only two or three inquiries (one, which was somewhat unsatisfactory, on the Equitable Life business). This is also a proposal for a regulation and as such UKIP opposes legislation unless there is a very clear case for not so doing. (vote) William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is: against. The SRM, which complements the single supervisory mechanism (SSM), is a pillar of Banking Union. It is designed to centralise control, authority and management over bank failures in the Eurozone (and other participating Member States – the ‘pre-ins’ such as Sweden). However, much of the drafting fails to make adequate distinction between the UK and the Eurozone, leaving room for judicial ‘interpretation’ to harmonise across the whole single/internal market – in fact the Committee amendments expressly encourage this. Moreover, Banking Union is against the long term interests of the Member States of the Eurozone as it perpetuates the euro as a job-destroying machine. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s Position is against. This Directive is designed to provide the EU with tools to deal with unsound or failing credit institutions and investment firms (and their group entities). It aims to make sure ‘resolution’ takes place speedily and with minimal risk to financial stability. The Directive intends to preserve systemically important functions when a bank fails so that, on failure, shareholders and creditors, rather than taxpayers, bear the losses.

 Our position is against. This directive introduces rules relating to payment accounts, with a particular focus on transparency for fees, easier switching mechanisms and broader access to basic bank accounts. Many elements of this reform have already been in place in the UK for some time, and the UK’s prime objective in negotiations on this file was to ensure that key elements of its own system were preserved. Unnecessary harmonisation, over-regulation and interference in freedom of contract. The right to a bank account may sound beneficial but would be more easily delivered by abandoning the over-regulation resulting from anti-money laundering regulations. If, as HMG says, much of this is already in place, we don't need a further tier of regulation muddying the waters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. More ‘retail-friendly’ legislation designed to eliminate risk, without realising this also stifles innovation and adds cost without reward. The consumer is already adequately covered by existing legislation and by common law, so it would be better to focus energy on improving enforcement rather than fiddling with the rules to create unnecessary harmonisation for its own sake. This regulation creates a new Key Information Document (KID) to be produced by investment product manufacturers and provided to retail customers when they are considering buying investment products. The negotiations centred on the appropriate content and length of the KID, as well as to which products it would apply. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This Regulation establishes a EU procedure for a protective measure which enables a creditor to obtain a European Account Preservation Order (‘EAPO’) preventing the withdrawal or transfer of funds held by the debtor in a bank account within the Union. The EAPO will be available to the creditor as an alternative to protective measures existing under national law in the Member States. This is an unnecessary piece of legislation. As noted above, this is intended as an alternative to measures under national law.

They want to make large companies jump through hoops by providing huge amounts of further information to the public. As regards matters relating to reporting, a new recital sets out the main issues to be reported on. Environmental information, for instance, will have to include greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and the use of renewable energy. With reference to social and staff-related matters, the information should concern, amongst other things, the implementation of fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, working conditions and social dialogue. Information relating to human rights and the fight against corruption, however, will have to include at least data concerning the prevention of human rights infringements and explanations as to the tools used by the undertaking to combat corruption and bribery.

 Mr President, I am going to focus on paragraph 46 of the report. This says, and I quote, ‘an EU seat in an enlarged UN Security Council remains a central, long-term goal of the European Union’. Later, it calls for – and I quote again – ‘the introduction of new members of the UN Security Council and reform of the UN Security Council’s decision-making towards the possible use of a super-qualified majority’. In the European Union, the United Kingdom has very little influence. We have just 8.24[nbsp ]% of the weighted votes in the Council of Ministers, less than 10[nbsp ]% of MEPs and the ability to appoint just one of 28 Commissioners. However, the UK is represented in its own right in international organisations. Perhaps the most significant is the UK’s permanent seat on the UN Security Council and the veto that goes with it. This report, and the thinking behind it, puts at risk the UK’s seat on the UN Security Council and also the UK’s veto. Let us be crystal clear. The UK’s continuing membership of the European Union does not enhance our influence in the world. It is in fact exactly the other way round. Our influence is thereby, and inevitably, diminished.

 With the greatest possible respect you actually got it wrong. There is a seat on the UN Security Council. That seat has a veto. What the report proposes is that the EU should have a seat. It also proposes that the method of voting, and I quote, ‘should make use of a super-qualified majority’, which would have the effect of losing the veto. So, therefore, it diminishes the position of the UK and, incidentally, of France, on two counts, not just one.

 Mr Ashworth, first of all I should like to thank you for accepting my question. Your party, the British Conservative Party, is a vociferous supporter of – it may even be said to be a cheerleader for – the entry of Turkey into the European Union. Turkey is getting pre-accession funding of about EUR[nbsp ]900 million a year, which is planned to continue for another six years. How does your party’s support for Turkey sit alongside your two principles of limited funding and value for money? I look forward to your answer. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I am just going to address one item in the budget, and that is the instrument for pre-accession funding. In seven years from 2014, the European Union has budgeted over EUR[nbsp ]14 billion to be paid to countries who are not EU Member States. These countries get the money because they are candidate countries. They are a former Yugoslav Republic, Iceland, Montenegro, and the one that gets the most money: Turkey. And Turkey especially will cost us even more in cohesion funds should it become a Member State. Bizarrely, the establishment parties in the UK are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the European Union. And let me be crystal clear: any political party that supports, let alone vociferously supports, Turkey’s candidacy can have no credibility when it comes to controlling, let alone cutting, the vast and wasteful EU budget.

 Thank you for taking the question. Mr Lambsdorff, you mentioned the word ‘freedoms’ in your speech. Now, should Turkey obtain freedom of movement, what is your careful estimate of the number of Turkish citizens who will emigrate from Turkey to northern Europe, in particular to Germany and the UK? And to help you with your response, it is estimated that the population of Turkey in 2025 will be 90 million. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Madam President, geographically, Turkey is 97% in Asia. However, the Turkish Government’s attitude to dissent places it 100% in the Middle East. There is – like in Cuba – a bill to curb internet freedom. The Justice Minister has powers to appoint and discipline judges and prosecutors. Worst of all, currently there are 40 journalists in prison in Turkey. The Commissioner, in his arrogant self-absorption, said that he had spoken to the Turks about this. They are clearly not paying any attention to the Commissioner at all. In Turkey there is a subjugation of the media, the judiciary and civil society that is almost without precedent in a seeming democracy. To put it simply, Turkey does not subscribe to Western values. Turkey should be regarded as too big, too poor, too different and too authoritarian ever to become a member of the European Union. It is totally depressing that the establishment UK political parties are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the EU. They – and this House – should think again.

 One hundred and twenty years ago, the British Parliament passed the Sale of Goods Act. In 1979, that Act was re-enacted with minor amendments and it remains very much the same today. Every day in Britain, millions of people and thousands of businesses buy and sell under contracts governed by the Sale of Goods Act. The Act has stood the test of time because it is a model of brevity, clarity and simplicity. Now along comes the Commission, in its self-absorbed wisdom, proffering a common European sales law. Twice the length of the UK Sale of Goods Act, it is a minor masterpiece of legislative flatulence which will benefit only lawyers.

 Mr President, to declare an interest, I have the honour to represent Gibraltar and its people. I am speaking now to address potential problems at Gibraltar airport.

This has resulted in massive and unacceptable delays. Incidentally, the people who suffer are mostly Spanish citizens. Because of the problems at the land border, air travel becomes of prime importance. Attempts have been made, and are being made, by Members of this Parliament, by means of legislative devices, to suffocate air travel in and out of Gibraltar’s airport. This must not be. This is a disgrace and I urge colleagues to support the amendments today. I would further go on to say... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, of course we are all, in principle, against subsidised imports – that is dumping – and there has to be trade defence when trade counterparties decline to accept the principles that underpin free and open trade. But by trade defence we do not mean what happened when the otherwise distinguished EU Commissioner for Trade was happy to launch what might have become a full-scale trade war with China over the comparatively minor matter of solar panels. I have described this previously as a frolic. It also took place against the representations of 17 of the then 27 Member States. This report, in its essentials, gives greater scope, power and discretion to the Commission. Illegal dumping by third countries of course needs to be dealt with, but not by appointed trade officials acting on a whim. The European Union, in its beginnings and in its operations, is a protectionist construct. On open trade, it is simply not credible. In the context of dumping, the way forward is a sense of proportionality. That is how an independent Britain should handle this problem, and there will be an independent Britain sooner than most people think – and that ‘most people’ includes the President of Italy today.

Nevertheless, to give just one example, the European Union is now operating an incredible 140 embassies or equivalent, and this costs a lot. To make matters worse, the value of the salary package of up to 500 of the personnel is greater than that received by the British Prime Minister.

Mr President, Libya was the most recent conflict directly concerning Member States, and just 11 of the Member States supported the UN resolution. From this and other examples, it is clear that, in fact and reality, there is no – and I repeat no – common foreign and security policy between Member States. What there is, is an EU Foreign Service – the External Action Service – apparently with 30 missions, and what that is, is a gigantic gravy train for EU insiders and their hangers-on. My amendment in June proposed that External Action Service personnel be restricted to ten weeks’ paid holiday a year. Just 84 MEPs voted in favour.

Mr President, as has been said, 26 Member States have individual bilateral investment agreements in force with China, and it would be a better use of everyone’s time if the Trade Commissioner dropped the attempt to negotiate an EU-China Investment Agreement and simply left it to the outstanding two, Latvia and Ireland, to negotiate their own agreement. But there is another vital point here. Switzerland has a trade agreement with China, New Zealand has a trade agreement with China, and in particular Iceland has a trade agreement with China. The fact is that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade bloc in order to sign trade agreements. Demonstrably, it is just not true.  Iceland, as most of us know, has now suspended its application for EU Membership. In my view, it is a very wise decision. In the context just of trade, were Iceland to join the EU, it would then be obliged to abandon the trade agreement it already has with China. And so, colleagues, the message for the UK is very clear.

Mr President, the EEAS is the EU’s Foreign Service. An EU Foreign Service is based on the assumption that there is a communality of interest among the 27 Member States. This is a fallacy. In Libya, only eight European countries took part, not 27, and one of them was not a member of the EU. The 27 Member States are – to coin a phrase – ‘a coalition of the unwilling’, and sometimes less than that. There is also the sheer wasteful cost of the EU’s Foreign Service. EEAS staff are very highly paid. Indeed, up to one hundred officials enjoy take-home pay that is more than that of Britain’s Foreign Secretary. The financial climate has the consequence that the UK is closing down embassies and consulates. Nonetheless, we are made to contribute – and to contribute very substantially – to the EU’s Foreign Service in order to advance a foreign policy that is not – I repeat not – ours. All of this – the EEAS – is a demonstration yet again that Britain’s membership of the EU in actuality diminishes our influence in the world. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

Mr President, Bosnia has an eye-watering unemployment rate of 43%. It is yet another very poor Eastern European country in line to join the EU. Once the door is open to Bosnia, there will be a massive outflow of people. The UK will then be a magnet. Back home, the British Conservative Party claims to be committed to reducing immigration. But, as we all know, that is an impossibility so long as we remain in the EU, and the impossibility is compounded as more countries get EU membership and their people in consequence have the right of free movement. It is simply breathtaking that the British Government and the Labour Party, none of whose representatives are here, can support – and support actively – Bosnia Herzegovina joining the EU.

Mr Rouček, I think with respect that you are missing the point. It is not very many at the moment, but that is precisely because we are able to have immigration controls.

 Madam President, my government, the British Government, recognises that the current legislation needs toughening up because of compromises, but is basically in favour. The rapporteur herself is unhappy with at least most of the amendments and is asking for a pass on the whole thing without the amendments. However, within that, the provision of services is already catered for because it is prohibited to prevent a worker in this situation, on grounds of residence or nationality, from working in another state by way of posting. The rapporteur’s latest brief emphasises workers’ rights when posted to another country, but surely that is a question of the national law of that country. If that is followed, why is there the need for extra legislation? Let the national law take care of it. But that brings me unfortunately to the dreadful business of the Laval case. That was 10 years ago now but it is still relevant. Here you will remember a Latvian firm won a contract to build an educational facility in Sweden and brought in a team of Latvian workers to do the job. By way of collective agreement, they undertook to pay those workers less than the Swedish minimum wage, which was an act of law in Sweden. The unions and the Swedish Government objected. They took it to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Justice found in favour of the employers. When the employers and the unions in Sweden objected further and said that they might take strike action, and was that not legitimate, was that not within the rule of law, was that not a right? then the ECJ came back with the answer: yes, it is a fundamental right to strike, but not as fundamental as the right of free movement. If that is the way this project is going, it is descending into an Orwellian nightmare and will come to grief quicker, rather than later. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the Troika was invented to cope with the stagnation of growth and jobs. It has imposed austerity packages which have included reducing wages. However, trade unions have long argued that wage depression becomes dangerous. One country’s domestic demand becomes another’s export potential. Squeezing wages also squeezes demand, so imports and exports both go down. In such a closely-related trading block as the EU, that becomes a serious problem for all, as it sets in motion a downward spiral. A stable home market keeps production going and boosts exports to the rest of the world. The greatest hope, surely, is to allow those EU countries that need it to withdraw from the euro and to restart trading on a better basis. It will be hard going, but they will see the end coming into sight. Of course, to remain competitive, they will have to set their currency at a favourable rate for the export trade, and that is to devalue. In that case, wages will remain low. But what do people want: a low paid job or no job at all? For those countries most badly hit, their economies are in the hands of the unelected Troika. Can we really accept that, in an EU which keeps on emphasising its democratic credentials, we have actually seen the duly-elected Prime Ministers of two Member States usurped by the placemen of the Troika? Unless the EU returns to proper democracy, we shall not see the end of this austerity. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commissioner for Employment says that free movement of workers is a key principle of the single market, which is why, in 2004, only Sweden, Ireland and the UK exerted restrictions on 10 new Member States. The then British Home Secretary Jack Straw now says that opening borders to eastern European immigration was a spectacular mistake, while Mr[nbsp ]Barroso recently admitted that the influx of eastern Europeans was putting pressure on communities and leading to abuses in some cases. Is realism now appearing? For Croatia, 13 Member States out of 27 will use restrictions, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, while Germany and Austria will restrict posted workers. Now, will Croatians join Bulgarians and Romanians in having first call on jobs in preference to third-country nationals, as in the Commissionʼs statement of April last year? But that is discrimination, and I raised this twice in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last year and did not receive an answer. I now require a commensurate answer as to why this discrimination continues. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

The lady concerned talked about my misinterpretation or the overuse of regulations, written and otherwise, by the Commission. This whole House works by the written regulations! Only recently we have had two examples in voting in this committee where a rapporteur was overturned in his request because he had not conformed to the exact written requisition that he was asking for. The whole point is that this place runs by written regulation, and I repeat, the regulation about workers from Bulgaria and Romania having pride of place over third country nationals was in a Commission document of April last year, and Mr Andor will confirm that.

 Madam President, homelessness and hopelessness lead to criminality in all too many cases, or at least to a social entrapment in which generation after generation is trapped in poverty. It threatens to become the scourge of the age. There are many causes, but one of the keys is surely employment, and one of the answers to that is surely education. I regret to say that my own government is guilty of neglect. In 1945 they introduced a scheme whereby those with academic ability could attend grammar schools, which had previously been the province of the wealthy. That offered a better way out, breaking the circle. It was the greatest social mobility scheme ever. It even benefited me, but later governments abolished it. We need an education system in Europe which caters for all abilities. We need academic schools, technical schools, commercial schools, sports academies, drama schools, universities and colleges of further education. We need industrialists to take on apprentices and send them to university at their expense, and we need those industrialists to invest in the poorer countries of Europe to help raise their standard. I do not believe in the mass migration of people across Europe promoted by this EU. We need settled communities, not footloose ones; we need people trained in a range of skills and for them, for the most part, to remain in their homelands to develop prosperity there, raising their standard of living and banishing homelessness through their own efforts. Finally, Madam President, allow me to point out that I come from country which was recently and disgracefully described by this Commissioner as a nasty country, and my final comment is: I do not wish to see poor countries in Europe.

Madam President, 9 000 people in Ireland – at Dell, Waterford Crystal and elsewhere – will be grateful for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, helping with guidance, training and education, when their firms close. Some blame cheap Chinese goods, produced through low wages, but two years ago in this House a Commission statement denied that this was true. The Commissioner said that it was China having its own central bank, setting its own interest rates and relating to world conditions so that exchange rates are helpful, resulting in goods at prices other people can afford. Instead, we have draconian measures in place to prevent individual companies establishing their own exchange rates and competing globally, promoting prosperity. At the same time, report after report comes out of this House, all imposing more regulation. The result? Higher costs, reduced sales, firms closing and moving abroad, leading to rising unemployment. And all you do is wheel out the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, trying to conceal the fact that company after company is closing under the weight of EU inflicted regulation, when you cannot even keep well-established companies going. And you call that world leadership? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the UK Health Food Manufacturers Association is non-profit. It represents 120 companies and suppliers; it has a very strong safety record and it knows that safety levels will be set well below what is regarded as safe in the UK in cases where there is no health risk. They know that only 22 additives will be allowed, meaning that potassium sorbate – a vital ingredient for vitamin D drops as recommended by our own Department of Health for children under the age of 36 months – will be banned.   GBP 100 million of sales are at risk. In the UK, over 700 health food stores will be at risk, with 4 000 jobs – all in the SME sector. Across the EU, over EUR 8 billion will be at risk: 5 000 companies and 75 000 jobs. And this report is supposed to be about more competitiveness, sustainability and an inclusive Europe. What is inclusive about shutting out the SMEs so that, once again, it is the big companies that pick up the trade and leave the unemployed from the SMEs to flounder and do what they can?

 Mr President, I am against this report because I am a libertarian. I want to let the people decide what is best for them, and several UK organisations agree with me, especially on Amendment 40. The Commission document is a real dog’s breakfast. It lists among the regulatory instruments everything from sticking plasters to X-ray machines, taking in elbow implants, lung implants, breast implants, even presumably the metal implant in my own left ankle, which is now all metal and pieces of plastic and I am perfectly okay. The impact of this will, of course, be in over-the-counter sales, and here we have small and medium-sized enterprises at risk. You are going to drive up unemployment at a time when we already have over-unemployment; many young people out of work, when they could be working in shops selling this sort of thing. It will only produce more red tape, and the SMEs will then suffer. And who picks up the bill? Who picks up the pieces?  Why, the big pharma. They will make hay while the sun shines, when all the time everybody in the EU thinks it is all about them as individuals. It is not. It is all about the big companies. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, from Britain, from the House of Lords, our upper Chamber, I have received a note today of an inquiry they have launched into Europe’s young jobless. They note that the EU is going to spend EUR 8 billion over the next six years and they want to know if that will add any value to all these proposals. They note also that there is a brain drain in Europe and what are we going to do about it, with young people, without a job, leaving in such great numbers for work elsewhere? We all know that Spain has got something like 50% unemployed: 280 000 young people left Spain alone last year to seek their fortunes either in the rest of Europe or in South America. It is no coincidence that Spain, together with several other southern European countries, is struggling. Ireland, Portugal, Greece and others: what have they in common? The euro: a strait-jacket which is robbing them of their economy. No wonder they are in trouble; no wonder they have high youth unemployment.

  Mr President, I have recently been in contact with the President of the Caravan Club of Great Britain. He is most concerned about this possible new legislation. I personally am horrified. I don’t know how many other people here I speak for, but I was a caravanner for many years and belonged to the Caravan Club – not to attend their gatherings and rallys and so on, but to obtain advice and information, including tips on how to tow. I hardly use my caravan in the UK. I brought it across the Channel and had my holidays here. I’ve towed it all the way from Calais to the south of France. I’ve taken it over the Alps into Italy. I’ve gone around the Alps in Switzerland and other places, all without an accident of any description. Nor did I see one with any other caravan, and nor did I see a caravan on a caravan site which had obviously been damaged in an accident. Why? Because I took my caravan for servicing myself every year. I did not want to part company with my caravan down a German autobahn. Neither does anybody else! Do people not understand that if a caravan is not in good order and has an accident on its own, like snaking or suddenly departing from its pre-designed course, then it takes the car with it and everybody in the car will suffer injury if not death? Caravanners, in spite of what they might look like, are not mad. They will look after their caravans for the sake of their own necks. This proposed regulation is completely superfluous and I will oppose it with all my strength. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP strongly supports UK laws which seek to prevent, control or, where necessary, punish those who engage in domestic violence. The UK has developed an effective system of law to protect spouses and children from such acts. Such laws are constantly being improved. UKIP will always support sensible and workable developments in those laws. This measure allows the writ of foreign judges – who are in no way accountable to Parliament or the British people – to run the UK. A protection order made in any other Member State will be enforceable without further ado, potentially leading to imprisonment. As such this is an unacceptable infringement of the sovereign right of Parliament and the Courts to have exclusive jurisdiction over such matters according to UK law. Furthermore an order made by a foreign judge with no concept of the very real difficulties and practicabilities of the enforcement of such orders within the context of UK law will lead to grave injustices which will make those produced by the European Arrest Warrant seem tame in comparison. The UK Courts are the best forum for such matters, For those reasons we strongly oppose this measure, whilst abhorring all domestic violence. Derek Roland Clark,

Mr President, I speak from a UK perspective. We have a long and proud history of accepting people from elsewhere, especially those fleeing political and religious persecution.  In a time when there were no schools or hospitals, and electricity and public transport were non-existent, newcomers made their own way; but now they need these facilities, and we, the most densely-crowded country in the EU, are struggling to cope. That is no good for anyone, and we certainly cannot provide the social security they need. In these difficult times, we cannot provide properly for those who have been paying their taxes in the UK throughout their working lives; we cannot go on taking in people. So the suggestions in this report are impossible. Even my own government, which is in favour of the EU, is concerned that the number of proposals in this report are overly bureaucratic. We cannot regularise illegal immigrants. That would open the door to a flood of unmanageable proportions. Will the UK suddenly be expected to accept great numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians after 1 January next year? Especially after the Commission document presented to the Committee on Employment last April, which demands that Bulgarians or Romanians seeking work must be given prior claim over a third-country national. That excludes people from the British Commonwealth, who the rapporteur now thinks should go to the US instead.  It is also discrimination which is outlawed by the Lisbon Treaty. I do not think it is right to take in people for menial work; that is exploitation. Skilled workers from Eastern Europe may be welcome, but they are exactly what their own country needs to build their economy and prosperity. That is not fair. I do not want to see poor countries in Europe.  In truth, is not this report part of a programme to force people to move around the EU with financial assistance from the Commission, mixing up the peoples of Europe so that its countries disappear, to be replaced by a single state called Europe?

Mr President, note that unemployment in the EU is 10.5% of the working age population. Among the young it is averaging 28% across the EU, with nearly 50% in Greece and Spain. In the UK the overall unemployment rate is 7.7%, with youth unemployment at less than 20%. At the same time Britain is seen as unenthusiastic towards the EU. Indeed this morning, commenting on David Cameron, speakers said that we cannot take the parts we want and opt out of the rest. That is an echo of one of the first comments I heard in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs after election in 2004: ‘We do not want Member States to opt out of the Working Time Directive. That will give them an advantage’. But we did opt out – legally – of certain provisions of the WTD, leaving UK employers more free to employ workers. Is that why the UK figures are better than the EU average? Social aspects and growth improve when people have jobs. It is not therefore a question of policy coordination, but of keeping policy out of employment. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

The EU is not doing very well. Its economic growth is failing, which is what you are talking about today. The whole idea is falling apart.

Derek Roland Clark,

Mr President, we should be concerned that growth in the EU is fading and that companies are moving abroad. Result? A great increase in the claims under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help redundant workers. That must be partly the reason for the massive budget deficit we heard about this morning. Did I hear right then? EUR 60 billion? That is taxpayers’ money.  This report speaks, among other things, of disseminating good practices, improving soft regulation processes, company disclosure of social and environmental information, emphasising the importance of national and subnational policies, and more of the same. It is about time the EU stopped generating the red tape of rules and regulations. In itself that consumes resources, so cut the red tape, reduce the business rate tax burden, and big multinationals might become more responsible, inclined to pay their tax and not avoid it. They could then concentrate on marketing their goods, generating income and retaining the workforce. And we all benefit. John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark and William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP voted against this report as it is yet more EU legislation over criminal law. The EU has no democratic right to legislate in this area and law-making should be left to elected politicians, accountable to the public, not unelected foreign Commissioners in Brussels. Of course, victims of crime should have the strongest rights and legal protection, but that is already afforded in UK law and “minimum standards” at EU level may well create a race to the bottom which makes our criminal justice system weaker.

Although there are elements to CFP reform which will give a small bit of relief to the fishing industry – and any changes to the current disastrous CFP rules is a step forward for the industry which the EU itself has destroyed – the only way we can save our stocks and fishing industry is to scrap the CFP altogether and repatriate it back to national governments accountable by the ballot box. The EU has no democratic mandate to create law in the UK and we cannot legitimise the process.

 This is an own initiative report, which is non-legislative and not binding on the EU Commission. UKIP voted against this although we do agree with ideas such as the use of selective fishing gear, the move towards discards and we share concerns over the proposed system of ‘transferable fishing concessions’ – we cannot support calls for more powers for EU fishing agencies, the creation of EU rules as to how scientists should collect data or EU propaganda campaigns aimed at schoolchildren. The CFP has been an economic and environmental disaster and we supported amendments which will help our fishing industry, but until the CFP is scrapped and fishing regulation is given back to elected governments, our fish stocks and industry will continue to suffer. Fishing regulation should be created by politicians accountable to the people by the ballot box, not the unelected Commission of the EU. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, with fish stocks in serious decline in Europe’s rich fishing grounds, the CFP is a failure. Yet these reports are laced with the same old Eurospeak – regulation, restriction, prohibit. Before the CFP, most European fishermen, unhampered by bureaucratic interference, had been fishing responsibly, looking after their own waters and therefore handing on viable fisheries down the generations. But the EU destroyed this culture of care and so now we have rules about total permissible catch and the wretched discard policy, which has decimated stocks. If you do not like lessons from the past, then try the present. Norway and Iceland still record good catches and find many species spawning well, but then they ban discards and other destructive EU measures which, as noted in these reports, have reduced EU fishing fleets. The UK fishing fleet is barely half its former size and so much of the fish sold in the UK now comes from Iceland. What an indictment of the CFP.

– Madam President, I do not believe that spending more taxpayers’ money will solve the growing problem of youth unemployment. Nor are grand plans and schemes, like the EU Youth opportunities initiative, the answer, for these have nothing to offer. To tackle a problem resulting from its own policies, the EU is proposing another expensive Commission programme. Rather, we should stop taking money from small businesses in particular, and remove the red tape burden from SMEs, which are the employers of half the workforce. That will free their businesses up and allow them to employ young people, reducing unemployment. We should reduce taxes on big business in return for them taking on young people in apprenticeships and training. With this kind of stimulus, they will prosper as their trainees, becoming more productive in years to come, plough their skills back in. For businesses offer actual practice and training, forming the habit of working and taking home money which has been earned, creating the dignity of providing for oneself, which can only help society.

Blue-card answer. 
– It was not me that said this first. It was Commissioner Barroso himself who, just under two years ago, said in this House that red tape was strangling small businesses. I have since asked the Commissioner twice what he is going to do about removing or reducing red tape. I get no answer. As for what I mean, I mean all the petty, small regulations which so hamper small businesses and drive some of them to the wall and some of them to distraction as the owner sits up late at night completing this form or that form or accounting for this penny or that penny. No, it is not the complete answer; nothing ever is. But it would be a jolly good start if small businesses in particular were freed of much of this red tape so they could get on with the job of doing what they are doing and then, because they have got more capital to spend, employ young people and help youth unemployment.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the EFF has EUR 4.5 billion to spend on fishing over the period 2007 to 2013 covering scrapping of fishing vessels, aquaculture, inland fishing, sustainability and administration of the fund. But fishing managed very well before the CFP was introduced, livings were made, fish was plentiful. Since its inception in 1973, the CFP has introduced rules and regulations to control fishing. Now the EFF – why? After all, fishermen have been plying their trade for centuries without all this, and a viable industry has been passed down the generations. Fishermen are not stupid. They have looked after their stocks, just as a farmer looks after his livestock and land. This proposal, of course, is a backdoor way of giving extra financial support to countries which have been bailed out, bailout funds under the EFSM will trigger this extra support from the EFF, and yet more taxpayers’ money goes down the drain. So this whole scheme, purporting to help fishing with more funds, is really an addition to bailouts, which are supposed to be loans by way of bond issues with time limits for repayment. Does that mean that the extra EFF money will not be included in bailout repayments? Does it mean that cash will be available without issuing bonds? If so, EFF funding will be a gift to offset a debt. What kind of finance is that? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, with the Greek and Italian debt crises under the burden of the euro, of course unemployment is rising. Spain has over 40% youth unemployment – yet there is a call for more Europe. Employment policy should be to cut regulations by half at least as the target for 2020, instead of which more legislation is being proposed. If you want growth and jobs, stop promoting the failed euro. Look at what it has done to Greece. Set them and others free, free to reorganise their own currency and to set their own interest rates. Remember the euro forerunner, the ERM? My country was in that project; interest rates rose and so did unemployment. Finally, interest rates went up to 15% – totally unsustainable – but at least the government came to its senses and withdrew from the ERM. That was on Black Wednesday in 1992, but it should be remembered as ‘Freedom Wednesday’, for interest rates fell, employment gradually recovered and we entered a period of economic growth. Now that is the model you want. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers.

– Madam President, how many men does it take to change a light bulb? In one English council, tenants must send for council staff, who may not use ladders, only scaffolding. That is three people: one holds the rigging, one changes the bulb and one supervises. That is the crazy English, but I do have better examples. At a meeting six years ago, I was astonished to hear of the number of young people injured at work. The independent body – unconnected with the EU – which had called the meeting suggested a range of safe practices which they claimed had reduced these figures – without legislation. As I have said before, good ideas always spread, and a Latvian took these documents to use locally. But the EU legislates; we do it every day. Why – if good results can be achieved by unbiased advice from non-political sources? So I ask that elements of this draft report, such as simplifying existing legislation, implementing national strategies and adjusting to the context of Member States, carry through to the final, advisory version. Voluntary systems are always best: no infringement proceedings. Derek Roland Clark,

. – Mr President, the CFP was only introduced in 1973, when the UK joined the common market. Up to then, UK fishermen had looked after their fisheries so well, without all these regulations, that other profligate Member States wanted a slice of our action. The result? Illegal fishing. Any system of complex rules and regulations produces cheats – that is human nature. Now you want to duplicate our coastguard and to consider more rules to combat possible illegal recreational fishing. Does the EU never stop meddling? To preserve fish stocks, Member States must be responsible for their own fishing waters up to the 200-mile limit or the median line. Bilateral arrangements would be up to them and they would have to protect their own fish stocks in their own interests, under their laws and their enforcement. Norway does just that. Stocks have recovered, especially the spawning stocks of several species – but then Norway is not in the EU and does not have to obey its crazy rules. It bans discards, requiring that all fish caught be landed. Meanwhile, EU stocks are seriously depleted. I know thought is being given to discards, but after 38 years of waste, will our stocks recover? As to combating illegal fishing globally, the EU’s discard policy is the greatest illegal fishing scandal of all! That – and licensing European fleets to raid the waters of the third world, reducing those people to poverty – is what I call illegal. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, to quote from your own documents, ‘national and local events will take place in every EU Member State’ – awareness-raising campaigns, workshops, school indoctrination and so on. The documents also say that this is mainly the responsibility of the Member State. No EU money is forthcoming, so it is Member States’ money. How do those countries most in need manage that? Only last month, this House voted to raise the take from Member States by 5%. Of a hundred budget lines, some 20 were for a reduction. With like-minded MEPs, I supported those – which would have saved European taxpayers EUR 100 million – but was outvoted by most of you on all except two lines, so only EUR 1 million was saved. If people keep more of their earnings, they spend more, helping other businesses to keep going and helping employment. So Member States who really need help for this programme will not get it. Where will they find the money? You have already raided their bank balances for bailout funds. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

− UKIP is firmly against all forms of sexual offences against children and in favour of tough, comprehensive criminal law to criminalise all forms of sexual offences against young people. The UK already has a considerable body of criminal law dealing with these crimes and remains at the forefront of developing new laws and techniques to combat perpetrators' activities as they develop in the internet age. UKIP supports the thrust of this report but cannot, as a matter of principle, concede to the EU the right to determine UK criminal law. For that reason we have abstained. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, we have been here before. Remember the Lisbon Agenda – the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world leading to more and better jobs, a 10-year programme which started in 2000? Where is it? It failed, of course: simply because you keep on thinking you can solve a problem by central decree. Sorry, it does not work that way. Such programmes need a written plan, and then rules and regulations, and there we go: straight into the red tape jungle. If you could only understand that: cut the red tape and all the restrictive regulations, and let people get on with what they do best – making things and selling them. Once again, I must remind you that big business can cope with red tape and can afford compliance officers and well-paid lawyers to bail them out if they make a mistake. SMEs, which employ half the workforce, do not have those resources, so when they get into trouble, they fold. Another one or two jobs go, and fewer youngsters are taken on to learn a trade. Take this morning’s farce in the vote on tyres for motor vehicles and trailers – not really a farce: it is another headache for the motor trade. For how many small garages will this be the last straw before they go under? This whole agenda is another one-size-fits-all idea, or rather, one-size-that-fits-no one. The euro is one of those: now falling apart before your eyes, and all you can think of is to try more of the same. The first casualties of that disaster are, of course, the SMEs – and more jobs are lost. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, I would like to ask the Minister how he can justify this proposal to treble maternity pay by requiring firms to pay new mothers their full salary for 20 weeks. Does he not know we are in the middle of one of the worst recessions of modern times? This will present businesses with the prospect of a 2 billion burden. Even my government opposes this move. In addition, Minister, you plan to extend minimum parental leave from three months to four months for each parent. That is separate from the maternity leave, with one month of the four not transferable to the other parent. Is the Council prepared to compromise on main issues like the duration of maternity leave and the level of payment? Otherwise, you intend to give Member States two years to amend their laws – though how you can say ‘their’ laws, I do not know. This comes straight from the Commission factory, and we shall oppose this job-destroying proposal. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was invented to persuade Member States to adopt Lisbon without national referendums, but this expensive project has insufficient checks. In Antwerp, General Motors claimed EUR 9.5 million from the EGAF. Their redundant workers received EUR 150 000 each and then some found work with Volvo nearby. Of the five countries with negative growth, three have put in no claims, while stronger economies have, with Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria leading the way, and several more this week. Many firms are closing due to trade moving to the Far East. Glasfiber in Denmark closed because their manufacturer of wind turbines moved to China. This does not happen just because Chinese workers are on low pay; indeed, on Tuesday in this House, the Commissioner discounted that. More to the point, what he said was that China’s central bank sets its own interest rates, while the exchange rates make Chinese products more attractive on world markets. EU manufacturers will struggle on world markets if euro membership makes their products too expensive – ask Greece! Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Rio +20 Earth Summit 2012 sounds important – but is it really? The Socialist one-world agenda has been having a hard time of it of late. Global problems require global solutions: sounds good. But global governance through scare stories about man-made global warming has fallen flat. People in the UK, US and China are hugely disbelieving. Everybody knows that CO2
 is not the cause of the ice ages coming and going. So how can a little extra CO2
 be a problem now, whether or not it causes a little extra global warning? Is not a little warming a good thing? Would anyone here really prefer icebergs in the Channel and polar bears in Brussels? The same goes for the even more vague scare stories that have been peddled using meaningless rhetoric since Rio twenty years ago. No one knows what sustainable development really means – and who would want unsustainable development anyway? The environmentalists’ ‘ban everything accept windmills’ attitude is going to send us back to the Middle Ages unless we put a stop to it. You are calling in this document for tangible actions and accountable targets, but of course that is all just Soviet five-year plans all over again. It is about time we recognised these failed Communist policies for what they are and go back to the honest free-market approach which creates wealth for all by innovation and hard work, not by endless interfering and political tinkering.

 – Madam President, yet another expensive, bureaucratic monster arises by combining VIS, SIS and Eurodac, whether or not any Member State currently participates in these agencies. It is meant to develop Schengen, which itself is under pressure due to the Libyan situation. What is the use of a system to allow free movement which has to be partially suspended because of the free movement it encourages? I understand there will be a central agency to retain fingerprints and biometric records for five years, including material obtained under SIS – ‘information regarding certain categories of persons and property’. So, under the guise of facilitating the free movement of people, we have a resurrection of the Stasi. Of course, this is intended to lead to EU immigration control. In the case of the UK, many immigrants come from the Commonwealth, a unique voluntary association including every single one of our former colonies. Well, we have our own border controls for that purpose, and the EU does not have the right to interfere. Derek Roland Clark,

 Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues. In the UK in May 2008, the Misleading Marketing Regulations came into force. They outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service. So the Office of Fair Trading can now take action against UK companies, but there is a serious drawback. The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints. More to the point, while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing, why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland Europe? The answer to that lies at the heart of this useless EU, which has demolished national frontiers. The free movement of people, goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers, the terrorists and for threatening, traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary.

– I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments. UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent, have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy. Unfortunately, the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, just when responsible people and governments are watching every penny, the Commission proposes more expense – Youth on the Move card, European skills passport, European Vacancy Monitor – through Europe 2020, all for cultural diplomacy and to get young people to travel when they do that already, backpacking their way round the world on their own initiative. What do we need expensive promotions for? As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: ‘United in Diversity’. Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire? Do not push EU culture; make Italian, German, French, Dutch, British and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them, and the rest will follow. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, this review’s 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market, but the eurozone is collapsing, so how can it provide more opportunities? It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets. What growth? In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio. I got no answers then, but now it seems I have some. The review’s five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations. The first principle of the review – creating a right environment – should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids. It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred. After all, Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year: ‘red tape is strangling SMEs’. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr President, after 30 years, the destructive practice of discards is to be addressed. Fleets at Grimsby are a few dozen fishing boats, where once there were a hundred. Two years ago West of Scotland fishermen tabled a plan to conserve white fish but, while they wait, stock depletion continues. A regional approach is suggested – why not? The EU divides the land into regions. Much worse is the renewal of licences for European fleets to raid the waters of the Comoros islands – and raid it will be, for local fishermen cannot compete with the superior EU-powered trawlers. The same thing has been done to others in that area. Is the House surprised that Somali fishermen denied a living have resumed the age-old vice of piracy? Five years ago, did Members see the TV pictures of hundreds of Western Saharans trying to seek refuge in the Canaries? EU licences had just been renewed for their waters and they too had seen it all before. In a pitiful, desperate attempt many died on the 800-mile journey in fishing boats never intended for the open sea. However, the EU does not care that people from the least-developed countries have been impoverished by its actions and, for that, it deserves to be condemned. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report claims that European solidarity and economic development will be threatened by a reduction of the budget. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory – that is why I voted against a freeze – when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break.

– Mr President, this goes beyond Ireland. Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms. Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages? I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States. It is all very well to say that ‘equal’ must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU? As an example, think ‘climate’: keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries. Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others. Of course wages cannot be equal. The Commission’s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties. I am not surprised: this is the EU at work. A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal. Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, my point of order regards the first two votes we have today on the calendar for next year and the year after. I have two points to raise, if you please. First of all, these votes simply illustrate how powerless this Parliament really is. Everybody here thinks they are getting more and more power, and more and more influence. But, in point of fact, these amendments are simply to get round the fact that we are obliged to have 12 part-sessions … (The President cut off the speaker) Derek Roland Clark,

– Mr President, this question mentions a territorial dimension with reference to other policies, including the CFP, which is a complete EU disaster. Fish stocks in the North Sea, part of the Atlantic, have been ruined by discards, which must be abolished. They should never have been contemplated in the first place. UK fishermen have carefully looked after fish stocks in their own territorial waters while others have ruined theirs by overfishing. No wonder the CFP was welcomed by other Member States, whose fishermen could not wait to get into the North Sea. One needs more territorial exclusion, not less. In my own region – the East Midlands – the fishermen of Boston have fished the Wash for generations, looking after the fish stocks and making sure that their trawl nets do not disturb the sea bed, for they know that this is where the immature shellfish develop and that this is where the creatures form the bottom of the food chain. This is their livelihood. Now they are forbidden to fish, on the pretext that their trawls damage the sea bottom. Meanwhile, a Dutch vessel is licensed to hoover up a million tonnes of gravel from the same sea bed, while E.ON is to dig a trench right through to the open sea to lay the line for a useless offshore wind farm. How much damage will all that do to the sea bed? How much longer will these fishermen be forced to stand by and watch their fishing grounds reduced to nothing while they are reduced to being benefit claimants? Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 22 November last year, the rapporteur said that pensions were exclusively a competence of the Member State. Now this has become something more like: although Member States have the lead, there are aspects where coordination at European level is important. In paragraph 9, the resolution stresses Member States’ competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies. There is double speak here, with EU control overturning principle. The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive – by 90% according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall. If that is exaggerated, it is certainly true that huge extra sums will be needed to prevent pensions collapsing, so premiums will rise massively. Pension firms and Member States do not need this report; they need help to keep premiums down. Otherwise, this misguided report has the potential to destroy that which it seeks to protect.

– Mr President, I am happy to read this speech on behalf of Mr Bloom, who has – in my view – been unfairly debarred from the Chamber this afternoon. We had a fiasco a year ago in Copenhagen, when 15 000 unqualified people, including MEPs and the whole entourage, descended on the place to double its carbon footprint for a fortnight and got hopelessly embroiled in climategate, which was very neatly timed to scotch the proceedings. Yes, we all remember the University of East Anglia getting shown for what it is: a centre of bogus science churned out by bought and paid-for scientists who rely on the EU’s Research DG and the UN’s ‘super quango’ for research funds and laboratories and on the UK taxpayers for their wages. They were shown up as forgers of data, forgers of climate computer models, hiders of inconvenient data and conspirators with Obama’s green minions. The taxpaying masses learned in no uncertain terms that the EU and the global green agenda is all about raising our carbon taxes and scaring us into compliance. Cancún would be not nearly as bad, of course. It is much warmer. It is a jolly winter, and the conspirators will be much more careful to hide their global governance agenda this year.

– Considering the illegitimacy, undemocratic structure, corruption and megalomaniac ulterior motivation of the European Union in general and the Commission, in particular, we of the UKIP cannot condone the Commission’s monopolisation of public funds for any purpose whatever and believe, consequently, that any monies it directs to the repair of last year’s flood damage in Ireland will not be properly used and will merely conceal the need for relief funding that is correctly disbursed and directed by democratically elected governments.

– UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries, as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines. However, in this case, the EU is making special arrangements for governments, outside of normal State aid rules, for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines. Amendment 25 and 36 are calling for a greater period of such flexibility before normal State aid laws would apply, which UKIP can go some way to support. UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because, although we do not support any EU State aid laws because it should be up to national governments to decide on subsidy levels, giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable, putting power back in to the hands of governments to make these decisions.

– I voted against the Gauzès report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom’s most important industry – financial services. It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive, from investment trusts to hedge funds, in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation. It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors. This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU. As usual, EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players. By punishing private equity funds, it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy. It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments. The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital. Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, poverty, especially the number of those at risk of poverty, has grown as the EU has grown, with each new Member State adding to the problem, so it is pretty obvious how to prevent further increases. One of your answers is to introduce a minimum income. I am in favour of a minimum wage, but only as set by each country for itself. A pan-EU minimum wage would distort the issue. In Scandinavia, for example, domestic heating must be more expensive for all income groups than in southern Europe. I oppose a minimum income because that means public funds to top up a low wage: more for the taxpayer to find in an economic crisis. How do you stop some employers paying less than they might because they know the benefit system will make it up? Answer: more regulations and red tape for businesses, falling most heavily on the SMEs who, between them, employ half the workforce. And, of course, minimum income harmonised across the EU will be followed by a harmonised tax system, reducing all to a grey amorphous mass, devoid of Europe’s greatest property: diversity.

 Mr President, what is the Commissioner thinking about? Has the Commission been asleep for the last two years? Here we are, at a time of economic stringency, despite what Mr Van Rompuy said this week. There are millions out of work, some newer Member States have still not got the promised financial package, and Germany has a billion-euro bill round its neck to underwrite the Greek economy. In Britain, my government is raising taxes, freezing public sector pay and pensions and cutting back on welfare while finding GBP 45 million every day for this place. And now you want to spend EUR 1.1 billion of hard pressed European taxpayers’ money on a programme to help partner countries along the EU borders. Is that what you mean by more Europe – or is it an attempt to draw these countries into the EU? It sounds like empire-building to me. After all, José Barroso himself called this an empire. We are told that the EU is to prevent further wars in Europe, but if you look at the record you will find that such wars were due to the empire-builders. Now you are doing it all over again.

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Madam President, the only guideline is for the EU to stop interfering. The Working Time Directive is a disincentive to work. Why cannot you let people work overtime when they want to? Please do not tell me that this is to protect workers from exploitation, when the EU’s puppet court, the ECJ, has ruled in favour of companies exploiting groups of workers by paying them less than a minimum wage in no less than four countries. Are you aware that more than a fifth of newly qualified junior doctors in the UK are turned down because the WTD means they lack experience and that more are dropping out of training for the same reason? This House passed a report on independent truck drivers recently which will result in many of them packing it in. In voting today, MEPs have approved a paragraph in the Bové report – which will add a massive reporting burden to SMEs – hours after President Barroso had complained that SMEs were being strangled by red tape.

 UKIP voted against the Alvaro report today because we do not want to give the EU greater power over personal data. This measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy. Confidential and private financial data belongs to the individual and not to the EU or the European Parliament. We are resolutely opposed to the spread of terrorism, but personal confidentiality must be protected where there is no prior suggestion of wrong-doing. If the UK is to enter into an agreement with the US it must be a fully reciprocal arrangement and not the almost one-way-traffic one that the EU has signed up to here. This is a matter for national governments to decide, and not for the European Parliament. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I abstained on the vote on Amendment 80 because, while the case for national governments to scrutinise the control of EEAS must be guaranteed, this amendment also guaranteed the right of the European Parliament to do the same. It is not acceptable to a sovereign nation for a European organisation to scrutinise its foreign service. It is not the business of the EP to do so. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against Amendments 1 and 29 so as to restore the Commission’s intention to exclude independent drivers from this directive. We believe that requiring independent drivers to account for the time spent arranging their schedules and bidding for new business will be impossible to monitor, especially when this is done at home, as well as using part of their allocated maximum working hours per week. This will result in less driving, causing them to become less competitive and resulting in unemployment. UKIP also believes in the freedom of individuals to set up in business and to work for themselves, but this directive will prevent that from taking place. Since this is not a health and safety issue, the only winners will be big businesses. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer report in the European Parliament because it is badly drafted, with inadequate definitions. The country of origin statement was badly worded, giving rise to confusion. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers and consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the public. UKIP believes MEPs are acting without sufficient information on this matter. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, it is essential that Amendment 30, with special regard to paragraph 7(a), be adopted. Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions. It is not a road safety issue. All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph. Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency. Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business. If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers. Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector. The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce. I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect. You do not hear that very often from this part of the House.

– UKIP regards the safety of nuclear power generation as being of great importance, but perceives the EU’s assistance to Bulgaria, ostensibly for this purpose, as being motivated by political considerations (preventing the reprocessing of fissile material, conveniently close to Bulgaria, in neighbouring Russia) and doctrinaire ones (the imposition of unrealistic wind-power policies) as well as by a desire to fund local conservation projects, which are not relevant to the remit of decommissioning. Consequently, UKIP members have voted against the extra funding asked for in this report. John Bufton  (EFD

– We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean. This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa. It would also allow North African al-Qaeda operatives in these countries to more easily enter Europe and carry out terrorist attacks.

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report.

– Madam President, why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level? Universities have shared information with each other for centuries, before the EU existed. The Renaissance, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, was a surge in intellectual development spreading from Florence right across Europe through the universities. The arts, music, literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today. So what of modernisation? Do you look for the technological developments of the future? If so, the scene today is just as promising. Universities elsewhere may be overtaking us, but they owe their beginnings to European universities. This tide of higher education often returns home. The universities of Britain take postgraduate students from across the world, pursuing their studies further and sharing their information, not least with commerce and industry. But we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the Bologna and the Erasmus processes. We do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other ‘-ism’, that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus. If you wish to serve the modern and future worlds, see that universities are funded properly, encourage those students who wish to study abroad, then simply leave them all alone to get on with it.

– Madam President, in anticipation of your calling the next vote on the Lehne report on deontology, may I please ask why this vote is being taken? It was due for debate last night under catch-the-eye. That was cancelled, so here we are voting on something which has not been debated, although it does not say so. For your information, Madam President, when this came before the Employment Committee a short while ago, nobody on that committee knew what deontology meant until I tried to explain it to them – not even the Chair! I think it is highly improper, therefore, to take a vote on this unknown, undebated motion. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the report on simplification of the CAP because, although the implementation of the report would make the policy more comprehensible, transparent and workable, simplifying farm inspection, adding to flexibility to payment arrangements and making it more farmer friendly, to do so is to keep the CAP on track and potentially help to extend it for another generation! UKIP therefore voted against the resolution as a whole, especially as it is without legislative impact. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

We call for the highest penalties in the land for those criminals perpetrating such a crime and for serious measures to wipe out such activity. However, we cannot support the EU using people-trafficking as a pretext to harmonise immigration and border policies over the heads of elected governments. It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability. If there were not open borders within the EU, and each country had its own immigration policy, serious organised crime and people-trafficking would be much easier to stamp out.

– UKIP is gravely concerned with the situation in Iran and calls for governments on both sides to come to a diplomatic, but above all, peaceful solution to the ongoing political and humanitarian breakdown in the country. The EU must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate the tense situation. Unaccountable EU bureaucrats, instead of elected politicians leading the negotiations, will end up with a bad outcome for Iran and the rest of the world. Negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments, not forced upon from above by the EU. There are many countries wanting to stay neutral, such as Ireland, and the EU representing those countries on this issue seriously undermines their democratically-backed policy.

– UKIP fully supports the relief efforts and is horrified at the loss of life and those affected by the disaster, but we cannot support legitimising the EU in spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money, along with its militaristic and diplomatic ambition to circumvent democratic and accountable nation states intervening in the crisis. Of course, we encourage government and individuals to give relief and money to help those affected and rebuild the country. However, this must be done transparently with the public and not by secretive, unelected bureaucrats with international ambitions of grandeur. Derek Roland Clark,

– Mr President, like charity, rights begin at home. I ask about the rights of Europeans Sikhs. Because they wear the kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger, beneath their clothing, they have been prevented from entering the European Parliament. The kirpan is an act of faith which they may not remove, so their exclusion is a matter of religious and racial intolerance. In successive years, I have written to each of the two previous Presidents and the Commission who all replied that the exclusion is on security grounds. In celebrating her diamond jubilee, Queen Elizabeth came to my region, the East Midlands, where in their place of worship in Leicester, she talked to Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan, standing as close to them as you are to your colleagues. I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago, I was at the Palace of Westminster. There, in our democratic parliament, very close to both the House of Lords and to the House of Commons, I met several Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan. With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know. His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears, fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours. As a result, you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place. So what of the Lisbon Treaty which speaks of a Union founded on respect for freedom, equality, the rights of minorities, values of non-discrimination? Will you live up to your treaty, or is it just empty words?

− I acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, and deplore the refusal of the UK Government to assist its farming community on this important issue. This report contained provisions related to this situation. However, this report also contained provisions totally unrelated to farming, which would have had a disastrous impact on the UK. In particular, this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol, agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, I could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains my vote on the subject. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Thursday 17April is the 30th anniversary of the murder of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher in London. She was killed in a hail of shots into a crowd from the Libyan Embassy. The murderer has so far not been brought to justice. Information has come to light that a suspect living in Jordan has confessed to the murder and his identity is known to the British security services and to the Metropolitan Police. So far, no action has been taken by the British authorities to question him and, if the evidence so demands, to request his extradition from Jordan to face trial. Contrary to popular belief, most of those in the Libyan Embassy at the time did not have diplomatic immunity and the suspect is not protected. PC Yvonne Fletcher deserves justice and the British authorities must now make every effort to bring her murderer to justice without further delay. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the Stockholm Programme includes the objective of constructing an EU system of criminal law. It is laughable that the EU should presume to create an area of so-called freedom, security and justice in England. The English already did that for themselves over the last 800 years and it served as a model for much of the civilised world. That system is now being subverted because of our subordination to an inferior continental system. This report euphemistically refers to the various so-called imbalances within the emerging EU system. These imbalances are caused by the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition which states that all EU Member Statesʼ police, judicial and penal systems are of equal value. This is absolute nonsense and is causing a growing number of cases of gross injustice. To protect ourselves, Britain must leave the European Union. And to bring that day forward the British can vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the EU intends to create a Public Prosecutor’s Office with vast legal powers across the Member States. The British Government has already announced that it will opt out of the public prosecutor scheme. However, the Government has already announced that it intends to permanently opt in to the 35 EU police and criminal justice measures. As I said here last month, those 35 measures are the most important and the most dangerous to our traditional freedoms and liberties. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the Government’s decision to opt out of the Public Prosecutor’s Office is both worthless and dishonest. The Prosecutorʼs Office will have at their disposal the use of all the existing legal instruments, such as the European Arrest Warrant, and the new ones, such as the European Investigation Order. Although the Prosecutorʼs Office will have no direct authority in the UK, it will have de facto power by means of the use of these legal instruments. The Tory-led coalition Government knows it cannot defend accepting the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the UK, so it seeks to achieve the same thing by the back door. There is still time for the Government to reverse its decision and opt out of the 35 measures. But to fully protect ourselves, we have to leave the European Union. To do that, vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

  We hear a lot about fundamental rights in this place. In England we had very good fundamental rights long before we joined the European Union. These were established over centuries under Habeas corpus
, the Bill of Rights, the presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt, to name just a few. These safeguards are now being destroyed by the creation of the EU’s own system of criminal justice. The European Arrest Warrant has been the cause of numerous cases of gross injustice, and these will continue to grow. Now we have the European Investigation Order, which will empower foreign police forces to require British police forces to carry out investigations on their behalf, which we will then have the privilege of paying for. The coalition government has the option to opt out of the existing 135 EU criminal justice measures. Instead it has announced its decision to opt out of 100 but opt in to 35. The 100 they are opting out of are of no consequence, being purely rhetorical, redundant or superseded by later legislation. The 35 measures they are opting in to are the worst and most dangerous, including the European Arrest Warrant. None of this is necessary, because there are already existing mutual assistance measures in place that allow police forces and judicial systems to cooperate with each other across national borders. This is not about cooperation. It is about harmonising our legal system in pursuit of the great ideological goal of a United States of Europe. If David Cameron is serious about repatriating power from the EU, he has the golden opportunity to do so now. There is still time to change the decision and opt out of all these measures, thereby protecting the real interests and freedoms of the British people. But I fear the Tories will do what they always do and sell their fellow countrymen down the river to the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Claude, can I ask you to retract something that you said in that speech? You referred to the Crete case and Mr[nbsp ]Hughes and you said that his attackers are on trial in Greece. No, those accused of attacking him are on trial in Greece and they are innocent until proved guilty. Some of them have alibis showing that they were not even present at the place where the attack took place. Nevertheless the lack of evidence against them has not stopped them being extradited. I know that you are a very fair man so would you like to retract the word ‘attacker’ and say ‘accused’ instead? Gerard Batten  (EFD

blue-card question
. –
 Sarah, you spoke about the excessive length of pre-trial detention and I would agree with you: that is to be avoided. But would you agree that one of the reasons for this is because, when people are extradited to Britain, the police must be case-ready. They have to have a case fully prepared to go to trial before they can extradite somebody. Whereas under some continental systems investigative judges may hold people while they investigate, which results in sometimes weeks, months or years of them being detained. Would you agree with me that every police force in the European Union should be case-ready before they request somebody’s judicial surrender? Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Madam President, this report calls for a directive which will allow judicial authorities to confiscate someone’s assets without a criminal conviction. What happened to the presumption of innocence until proved guilty? The bedrock of the English constitution is the Bill of Rights, 1689. It clearly says ‘that grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before convictions are illegal and void’. That means that no government or judicial authority can impose a fine or take away someone’s property for an alleged criminal activity, but must first secure a criminal conviction in a court of law. The Bill of Rights is a constitutional act and is still in force. Our freedoms and liberties are being eroded and destroyed, and the pretext is always the same: that we have to be protected from crime and terrorism. But the single biggest reason for the increased threat of crime in the UK and Europe is the EU’s open borders policy. Open borders mean that we cannot stop criminals – big and small, organised and disorganised – from coming to our country. Indeed, it will be illegal under the EU’s freedom of movement directives to discriminate against criminals. All UK MEPs should vote against this report. If a directive is adopted, then the British Government should unilaterally refuse to transpose it into UK law. It would be illegal and void. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, on the one hand, it is good for once to be able to agree with the report in that it opposes the merging of the European Police College and Europol. On the other hand, UK Independence Party MEPs cannot vote for it because it calls for yet more powers to be given to Europol. This report wants to increase Europolʼs powers to participate in the investigative and judicial proceedings of Member States.  Europol is of course the European Union’s emerging cross-border police force – the United States of Europe’s own FBI – but there is no need for it, or to enlarge its powers. Bilateral agreements between nation states are a far cheaper and more effective way of achieving the desired results, and by these means nations can retain democratic control and accountability over their own police forces.  Existing mechanisms and Interpol already exist to provide cooperation between the police forces of nation states. Few people in Britain realise that Europol officers have immunity for anything that they do or say in the course of their duties. Such immunity is a concept unknown under English law, where it is a centuries-old principle that no one is above the law. We need genuine cooperation between nation states, police and judicial authorities. We do not need a European police force, leading eventually to a European police state. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Madam President, on 10[nbsp ]February an article by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown appeared in The Independent
 newspaper. The headline described certain people as ‘hideously white’, while the text included a description of them as ‘pompous, backward and white’. These derogatory descriptions associated with race would appear to be an offence under the Race Relations Act. On that basis I have written to the Metropolitan Police.  The Independent 
is, I believe, on sale on the continent. If an EU citizen outside the United Kingdom complained about the article then Mrs Alibhai-Brown could find herself the subject of a European arrest warrant issued under the category of racism and xenophobia. She could find herself locked up for a considerable amount of time on the order of an investigating magistrate while the case is looked into. I would, of course, oppose her judicial surrender under a European arrest warrant as being contrary to the principles of English law. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, this morning President Barroso restated the European Union’s commitment to open borders as a fundamental principle. A sensible immigration policy in Britain would allow entry only to those people we might actually want: people with the skills to fill jobs that genuinely cannot be filled by our own unemployed; people who have a legitimate right to marry British citizens; people who are hardworking and law abiding. Instead, what has the EU given us? We also get criminals, drug addicts, alcoholics, beggars, vagrants and benefit-seekers. Decent British people see their living standards being driven down, while benefits and social housing are given to people who have never paid a penny in tax in the UK. That is what the EU has delivered for us, and next May the voters of Britain will deliver their verdicts on you, fellow Members, when they vote for the UK Independence Party in massive numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the subject of public procurement brings to mind the problems with the Brussels hemicycle. The hemicycle was, of course, closed in September 2012 because cracks were discovered in three of the beams holding up the roof. In December 2012 we were told that Parliament was having difficulty in finding a builder to do the repair work. This was, apparently, because they were concerned about the ten-year guarantee required. If the Chamber is reopened in April, as promised, it will have been closed for 18 months. Surely Parliament’s public procurement procedures should have been able to find a builder willing to do the work, given that money is no problem? Some might suspect that the long delay was deliberate, in order to prevent the Brussels Chamber being used as the sole meeting place of this Parliament, thereby ending the monthly and expensively monstrous trek to Strasbourg. If Parliament cannot organise its own public procedure policies, how can it possibly hope to organise everybody else’s? Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, some of you in Europe may need an area of freedom, security and justice. We already had one in England under our Constitution, our common law, protected by such things as the presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, the trial by jury and under the Bill of Rights. These are now being superseded and overridden by the EU creating its own system of civil and criminal law.  Any British citizen can now be carted off to any other EU Member State purely on the strength of a piece of paper: the infamous European Arrest Warrant. All of these rest on the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition, which says that any EU legal system is equal to any other EU legal system. This is obvious nonsense. The British Government had the opportunity to opt out of 135 of these measures in mid-2014; instead, it intends to opt into the 35 worst and most dangerous. Mr Cameron could have genuinely repatriated some powers; instead, he is going to hand to the EU on a plate powers that endanger all our traditional, centuries-old liberties and freedoms.

 Madam President, this report marks another step on the way to the European Union having its own armed forces. The Treaty on European Union of 1992 laid down the foundations for a common security and defence policy leading to a common defence. Common defence means only one thing: common armed forces, a European army. That goal is being steadily pursued by means of common procurement procedures, common communications systems and common command and control structures.  The British armed forces are being deliberately run down so that their resulting weaknesses can be used as an excuse for eventually merging them into a common EU army. The British army now has fewer soldiers than the German army had after the Versailles Treaty. Meanwhile, they are stretched to breaking point and expected to perform miracles. If Britain’s service men and women understand the writing on the wall, then they will vote en masse
 for the United Kingdom Independence Party. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

I do not think that this actually matters, because ever since I first sat in this Chamber in 2004 – and I spent the first four or five years on the Subcommittee on Security and Defence – it has been obvious that this is the goal that is being pursued. How many other constitutions have been overridden and changed in order to accommodate EU integration? Our own constitution in England is overridden and set aside by what is happening in the European Union, so I do not think they are going to worry about a few other smaller countries’ constitutions when pursuing their ultimate goal.

 Mr President, the regional development funds are some of the most expensive items in the EU budget. These schemes are often just a waste of money, but a waste of money used to promote the EU’s identity as a political state. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has also been a gift to organised crime. In Bulgaria, the mafia profited massively from ERDF funding being channelled into projects in which they have financial stakes. And now the criminals of candidate countries are keen to get in on the action too. The ERDF is a key part of EU propaganda. Legal requirements say that EU flags and placards must be fixed in places where the money has been spent, but there is no such thing as EU money. There is only taxpayers’ money. Member States would be better off spending their own money in their own way in a democratically accountable manner. Britain cannot afford this and it is yet another reason why Britain has to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, in his book In Praise of Folly
, Erasmus castigates various establishment groups of his day, and it still makes amusing reading 500 years later. In his criticism of theologians he says: ‘They will proclaim me a heretic. With this thunderbolt they terrify the people they don’t like. Their opinion of themselves is so great that they behave as if they were already in heaven; they look down pityingly on other men as so many worms. A wall of imposing definitions, conclusions, corollaries, and explicit and implicit propositions protects them. They are full of big words and newly-invented terms.’ It is unintended irony, surely, to associate the name of Erasmus with the European Union, the greatest folly of our age. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, by its nature, citizenship can only be of a political state. All British citizens were made citizens of the European Union in 1993 without their consent. Few realise that this also includes our supposedly sovereign Head of State, Her Majesty The Queen. Under the still-existing English Constitution, the Head of State cannot be subject to a higher political authority. The English monarch is the physical embodiment of the sovereignty of the nation, and that is the fundamental problem at the heart of British membership of the European Union. The British people still imagine that they are a free and sovereign people, and yet they are not. The issue can only be resolved by them, by a democratic decision accepting their new status as a region of the European Union, or by leaving and re-establishing our national democratic independence.

Mr President, if people have been illegally transported across European borders by the CIA, then that is wrong. Every criminal suspect is entitled to open justice and a fair trial. However, this oral question is not about that. It is about asking the Commission to introduce more measures to bring national security services under its control. The public can read more about this plan in the Commission’s own document entitled ‘European Security Strategy: A secure Europe in a better world’, published as part of the Stockholm programme.  These proposals are just another step along the road to creating a United States of Europe. Just as the EU now has its own foreign policy and is taking control of Member States’ armed forces, so it needs control of their security services to complete the picture. The EU does not yet have the power to do that and we must ensure that it never does. Gerard Batten,

Madam President, in the previous debate, Commissioner Malmström, if I heard her correctly, said that she wanted to open up more legal avenues for migration into Europe. Mrs Malmström, why do you not go to countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain and ask ordinary people how they feel about that? I imagine that the vast majority would tell you that they are ‘immigrationed out’ and that they actually want fewer – not more – waves of people coming to their country. Maybe you should try stepping outside of the Brussels ideological bubble and, dare I use the term, show some solidarity with the ordinary working people of Europe. You talk here about border controls, but you have no intention whatsoever of actually trying to control immigration. Britain is swamped by continual waves of immigration from outside and inside the European Union and the only way we can control that is to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, between 1958 and 1962 tens of thousands of women gave birth to babies with severe birth defects, including missing limbs. The cause of this was the drug Thalidomide, prescribed to pregnant women. In the UK there are about 467 surviving victims. As they age, their health problems are made worse by their disabilities. Some compensation was paid by the Distillers Company Ltd, the UK distributors, but the German inventor of the drug, Grünenthal, has never properly accepted its responsibilities or paid compensation to the British victims. The compensation the victims did receive is now inadequate to meet the rising costs of their care.  The survivors are an extraordinary group of brave, resilient and independent people. All they want is for Grünenthal to face up to its responsibilities and to arrive at a fair settlement. Please register your support for the Thalidomide victims’ campaign by going to their website http://www.showyourhand.org" . This gross injustice has gone on for 50 years too long. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, it has long been the reality that the USA could intercept any electronic communication anywhere in the world but the advent of the Internet and digital communications has created a whole new treasure trove of information which can be plundered by the security services. The reason that so many terrorist attacks in the UK and elsewhere have been thwarted is precisely because the security services have accessed the terrorist communications. Now that is on the plus side, but on the minus side the state now has the technical means to know almost everything about individual citizens. Now the challenge for democratic nation states is to ensure that access to personal information is only used according to strict legally established and internationally observed rules which protect the individual from the state. What we do not need is the EU using this issue to further assert its pretentions to be a political state. Equally it does not help that the British Government is now nothing more than a lapdog of the USA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

The security services have a tremendously difficult job in thwarting these attacks, and in the UK we know that there have been many – some we know about and some we do not – which have been stopped because of the security services’ ability to look at people’s communications. I think there are two issues here. There is the issue of what they can do by looking at people’s communications, and then there is this totally indiscriminate collecting of information on everybody, which I think is extremely dangerous. Can you imagine if Hitler, Stalin or Mao had had access to this information? I do not think that I am disagreeing with you; we probably agree more than we disagree on this. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, there is no rule of law in Russia. The Russian Government is a gangster regime which is successfully exporting the rule of lawlessness to the West. Meanwhile Western Governments follow a policy of appeasement. In 2006 agents of the Russian State murdered my constituent Alexander Litvinenko in an act of state-sponsored terrorism. David Cameron has broken his earlier promises to help uncover what happened; instead, he has made a deal with President Putin. The British Government is to withhold vital evidence from the coroner’s court proving the involvement of the Russian State. Russia blatantly murders people on the streets of London and the British Government agrees to look the other way.  Law enforcement in Russia is just a tool of organised crime. Any cooperation with Russia in security and legal matters should be out of the question until the rule of law is properly established there. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, last year we saw the Schengen system buckle under the strain of mass migration, and some Member States sought to introduce unilateral controls. The revision of the rules is an attempt to keep the lid on a boiling pot, but it is too little and too late. It only allows some controls in very exceptional circumstances for a limited period of time. It is too little, too late.  An open-borders policy could only work between countries with very similar and stable economic and cultural natures. The EU’s open-borders policy is a disaster for ordinary people, and has created enormous social problems. This has all been done in pursuit of a political ideology not shared by the people of Europe. That ideology is that the continent of Europe is a single country, a United States of Europe, which obviously it is not. The EU is out of touch with reality and in a contest between reality and ideology, reality always wins in the end.

Mr Goebbels, you asked about border controls. Yes, Britain is not in the Schengen system, but we still suffer from the effects of it because it is very much easier for people to get to Calais and make that final hop over to Britain. You are quite right: even though we are supposed to have border controls, immigration policy is a disaster in my country. This is not just because of the European Union, it is because of the complete inability and lack of will on the part of British governments to actually put in proper immigration controls and carry them out. So I agree with you that this is a disaster in my country that is not entirely of the making of the EU. In answer to Ms Morvai’s question regarding the free movement of people: no, we do not believe in the free movement of peoples in my party. We believe in controlled immigration and controlled border policy. We do not want to stop immigrants; we do not want to stop people coming. But we want this to be controlled by our government in the interests of the British people, and not in the interests of a political ideology which they do not share. If you are going to control people, it is a lot easier to do that than capital, which is often numbers on a computer, so I understand the problems there. We want to see policies in a whole range of areas that are in the interests of the British people, and then ultimately in the interests of everybody else. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the economies of Europe are in deep crisis, and unemployment is reaching record levels. But there is one boom industry offering unprecedented employment opportunities. That of course is organised crime. This report recognises the seriousness of the situation and offers the solution we have come to expect on every occasion, namely a common European approach and more harmonised laws. But it is precisely the common European approach that has helped create the problem in the first place. Every annual Europol organised crime threat assessment report since 2009 has said that the root cause for the growth of organised crime across Europe is the EU’s own open-borders policy. This report suggests the creation of an ‘intelligence training centre’. However, the intelligent thing to do would not be to set up another institution expanding the power of the EU, but to reintroduce border controls to prevent the free movement of criminals in the first place.

Mr President, I would like to apologise in advance for digressing from the subject of this debate and using my time to make reference to a shocking incident that has happened in my constituency, London, today. There has been a particularly cowardly and disgusting terrorist murder of a man in Woolwich. Initial reports indicate that the victim appears to be a member of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. I am sure that all of you, like me, will offer your deepest sympathy to the victim’s family, friends and colleagues. It is not possible to express the depth of outrage that all decent people will feel at this latest expression of barbaric and mindless terrorism. This crime will be condemned by all decent people.

Mr President, as this question makes clear, the report calls for the Commission to publish its proposals on a voluntary permanent Union relocation scheme, as promised since December 2011. It is the intention of this scheme that Member States can request assistance in the relocation of refugees and asylum seekers across EU borders. The UK, of course, has a long history of accepting refugees and asylum seekers in very significant numbers over centuries. If the proposed scheme is voluntary then what is the point? Member States could continue to determine their own responses to particular circumstances in relation to their own ability to respond, which is exactly what they should do. Asylum and immigration policy should remain under national control. It is easy to understand why the Commission does not want to come up with a scheme that will be unworkable in any case.

 Madam President, the next meeting of the Bilderberg Group is to be held in England. The location is thought to be the Grove Hotel, Watford, and the dates to be 6 to 9 June 2013. These annual meetings are summits of the most wealthy, powerful and influential people in the worlds of politics, finance and business. The biggest mystery surrounding them is why the mainstream newspapers and broadcasters have chosen not to report on them since 1954. In the internet age, however, their existence can no longer be kept secret. I have written to all the mainstream media outlets in the UK asking them if they intend to report on this meeting and if not, why not. I have also submitted a freedom-of-information request to the Hertfordshire Police Commissioner asking on what basis the policing for the event is being provided and who is paying the bill.

 Madam President, this is just a public relations exercise to paint a veneer of democracy over the undemocratic European Union. The best definition of democracy that I know of was given by Abraham Lincoln, who said that it was ‘government of the people, by the people and for the people’. There are no common people in Europe; there is no political identity with which they can identify, so you can never have a true democratic system in the European Union as a whole. The only democracy that makes any sense is the democracy of nation states, where people identify with a common political identity. All democratic governments in different countries take different forms. They all have different structures. But in order for a country to be called a democracy, it must have one single characteristic: the ability not only to elect the government but also to sack the government and replace it with a different government. Of course, that is the one thing you cannot do in the European Union. The people do not select the Commission, who are the effective government of the European Union, and they cannot sack them. Therefore no country that is a member of the European Union can claim to be a functioning democracy. We are seeing our democracies destroyed. All the governments of the western world, and in particular those of the European Union, are disconnecting from their own people and imposing policies on them which they do not want – like mass uncontrolled immigration and idiotic climate change legislation, which is destroying their economies. The only Citizens’ Initiative which makes any sense is the initiative to leave the European Union. People in Britain have the opportunity to do that by voting for the UK Independence Party, and they are doing it in increasing numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, why does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place? I expect she hopes to benefit from EU handouts and subsidies like so many before her. As a relatively poor country, I also expect that she hopes to offload some of her poorest citizens – her surplus population – by means of mass immigration under the EU’s open borders policy. Turkey has over 72 million people, and if she joins the EU we can expect a large number of them to migrate to countries like Britain. Perhaps they will come to work, or to go on the benefits or housing system again like so many before them and use our public services. The British public must beware that the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democratic parties are all in favour of Turkish entry and of yet more waves of mass immigration.

Mr President, over the last decade the international community has spent an enormous amount of money in assistance to Kosovo. At a rough estimate this is about EUR 4.7 billion. This includes about EUR 2.3 billion from the European Union and Member States. One of the key targets for this aid has been to combat organised crime and establish the rule of law. Now, how is that progressing? The EU office of criminal intelligence has said that ‘the situation regarding organised crime in Kosovo has not changed considerably since 1999’. A Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly report in December 2010 linked senior Kosovan politicians to criminal gangs involved in human organ trafficking. We already have plenty of criminals from Kosovo in London, despite the fact that it is not yet a member of the EU. EU entry would enable yet more to come. We already have enough, thank you very much.

Mr President, mutual societies and building societies were an excellent idea that originated in 18th century Birmingham, and the idea caught on and enabled millions of people to buy their own homes when otherwise they would have been unable to do so. But they were not intended to be cross-border international entrepreneurial businesses. A much better idea is for individual nation states to adopt the idea and adapt it to fit in with their own national requirements. This statute, if adopted, will mean more unwanted EU legislation and probably lead to unforeseen, unwanted consequences and unintended consequences. If there is any case for international cross-border operation, then there is no reason why this could not be accomplished by sovereign nation states with intergovernmental agreements.

Mr President, if I am in good shape it is not because I play football. I would happily admit that I know absolutely nothing about sport, but I do know a little bit about match-fixing.  First of all, let me say that this report calls for a specialised law enforcement unit to combat match-fixing. Well, I am pleased to tell you we have already got one in the United Kingdom, it is called the police force.  Having said that, in terms of match-fixing, the EU has been involved in a few fixed matches itself. Back in 1975, in the referendum in the UK on membership of the EU, that was a fixed match, when the Central Intelligence Agency of the USA put enormous amounts of money into the ‘Yes’ campaign and there was a concerted effort by the BBC and other organs of the media to actually fix the result. There was a fixed match in 1992 in Denmark when the referendum delivered the wrong result and they were told to go back and have a re-match until they came up with the right result. There was a fixed match in France and Holland on the Constitution when they came up with the wrong result, but rather than have the re-match, actually they changed the terms of the game and declared it a win anyway. And, of course, Ireland had a match fixed when it delivered the wrong result on the Lisbon Treaty, and then had to go back and have a re-match until it got the right result. So if there is going to be some kind of investigative body to look at fixed matches, I suggest we start with the European Union.

 Yes, I happily admit I know nothing about sport. I pretend to have no knowledge of it whatsoever.  In terms of international crime, there is already an international crime organisation called Interpol, which is there to share information, and there are national police forces that are there to pursue crime in their individual nation states. So I cannot see why you need yet another new body to do something that is already catered for by existing police forces and Interpol. I do not know why you imagine that some other body, created by the European Union, is going to be any more efficient than all the other bodies created by the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, it is poetic justice that my party, the UK Independence Party, wins seats in this place and wins them in increasing numbers. Indeed, we came second out of the UK political parties in 2009. We did so precisely because we are dedicated to taking Britain out of the European Union.  Regarding the composition of Parliament in 2014, I would like to make one prediction: the UK political party most likely to come first and return the highest number of MEPs will be the UK Independence Party. This will reflect the growing mood of the British population and will be another important milestone on the road to achieving Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, what does social security coordination mean? Does it mean that the benefits systems of all EU states are brought up to the British standard at their taxpayers’ expense? No, it means that the British benefits system is made available to any EU citizen who wants to use it. My constituency – London – particularly feels the impact of foreign claimants on the housing, health and benefits systems. David Cameron has had to respond to public outrage by saying that he wants to limit EU citizens’ access to benefits, but he cannot do so, and he knows it. It is not often that I can agree with an EU Commissioner, but Viviane Reding has said that this is against EU law and that he cannot discriminate on the basis of nationality. England is now the soup kitchen of the world, and the soup is running out. This is just one of the reasons why we have to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Many of my constituents have contacted me in desperation because their disability payments are being cut or stopped altogether. One lady rang to tell me of her young adult daughter who has a learning disability and whose disability benefit payment was being stopped because she has been assessed as fit for work. She took her daughter to the Job Centre to look for something she might be able to do. She found that all the low-skilled, low-paid jobs were taken, often by migrants without the disadvantage of a disability. In the same queue were EU citizens signing on for the Jobseeker’s Allowance. She asked me to explain why we, as a country, cannot afford her daughter’s benefit but we can afford to pay benefits to migrants from the EU. I told her that this was because our Government’s spending decisions and priorities are not decided in the interests of their own citizens but rather in order to comply with EU law and their ambitions to build a borderless United States of Europe. I further explained that the only solution to the problem is for Britain to leave the European Union.

Mr Van Orden, if in your report five years ago you highlighted all these problems – which were very serious problems then and which you now say are still very serious problems and in fact even worse probably than when you wrote your report – why did you then feel it necessary to recommend Bulgarian entry to the EU when it clearly did not fulfil the criteria that one would expect, the most basic criteria about rule of law and democracy in an entrant country?

Mr President, in January 2014 the final restrictions will be lifted on immigration into Britain from Romania and Bulgaria. A further 29 million people will be given the automatic right of entry, and it is estimated that this will result in at least 50 000 extra immigrants per year over the next five years. Britain is already overwhelmed and swamped with immigration because, as a member of the European Union, we have surrendered our right to control it. The British have nothing against Bulgarians or anyone else: we do not blame them for wanting to better their lives. But why do so many Bulgarians want to leave their country? Bulgaria is a desperately poor country under the control of criminals. Let me quote from the New York Times: ‘Politics is played to the death in Bulgaria, where the lives of politicians can be as cheap as spent bullets and murky business groups wage a murderous struggle for their cut of everything from real estate deals to millions in European aid’. Atanas Atanasov, a former counter-intelligence chief, has said, ‘Other countries have the mafia; in Bulgaria the mafia have the country’. How can democracy prosper under these conditions? There is a lack of a free media and press, a corrupt judiciary and legal system, widespread electoral fraud and criminal control of business. It is no surprise that many Bulgarians will choose to move somewhere else. One good thing that the EU did do was to suspend payments to Bulgaria. It is not right to send millions in aid for their criminals to plunder and make them richer. I feel desperately sorry for decent Bulgarians, but I feel even sorrier for my own country, which is being destroyed by membership of the European Union. The British political establishment is dedicated – or seems dedicated – to turning Britain into a third-world country. Britain cannot solve Bulgaria’s problems by importing Bulgarians.

Yes Mrs Dodds, I would agree with you. I think that we should designate groups like that as terrorism because the last thing that we want to see is what happened in Northern Ireland. Terrorism and politics often go hand in hand and I would hate to see it happen in my country, as it did in Northern Ireland, that the terrorists actually propel people into government, where they are now. Of course, I would like to see action taken against Islamic fundamentalism wherever it raises its head because it goes hand in hand with terrorism. In London we now have Sharia patrols intimidating people on the street on what they can or cannot do or can or cannot wear, and gays have been intimidated in the Bethnal Green area.

Mr President, this report proposes a regulation to reduce noise from motor vehicles and, like all legislation from this place, it will entail more bureaucracy and cost. For example, the report says that the quality of road surfaces may be the solution to the problem. Perhaps, but how much would it cost to alter them? Given the current state of Member States’ finances, one wonders where they would find the money to carry out this momentous task.  This is a regulation. It will have automatic, binding, legal effect in every Member State. Democratically elected national governments do not have the right to decide whether they want to apply it or not: they have no choice. Perhaps control of noise pollution is one of those powers that David Cameron wants to renegotiate the return of to the British Parliament, among those many thousands of others long ago surrendered to the European Union. Meanwhile, he must continue to obey his masters in Brussels. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Mr Imran Firasat is a Pakistani who converted from Islam to Christianity. Spain granted him asylum in 2004 because as an apostate his life was at risk. The Spanish authorities are now threatening to deport him to Pakistan under hate speech laws mandated by the European Commission.  Mr Firasat produced a film entitled ‘The Innocent Prophet’, as part of his critique of Islam. An altered version of the film was released last December without Mr Firasat’s consent. This appears to be the extent of his transgression. If Mr Firasat is deported he may face the death penalty for alleged blasphemy.  Individuals and organisations across Europe and the world are calling on the Spanish authorities not to take any action until Mr Firasat’s lawyers have lodged his appeal with the Spanish High Court. It would be a betrayal of all western liberal and democratic values if Mr Firasat was sent to his death for criticising a belief system. Gerard Batten,

Mr President, this is yet another unwarranted and unnecessary transfer of sovereignty from the nation state to the European Union. There is a highly respected patent court in the UK which is currently worth something like GBP 750 million per annum and this is now in danger. Patent specialists in the UK strongly contend that there is no demand in the UK for this change. There are serious concerns about judicial appointments to the new court and therefore about the quality of the decisions that will be made. Instead of a meritocratic appointment system, it seems that subscribing Member States will be entitled to a judge. Many of the smaller countries have tiny patent jurisdictions, few patent judges and few legal practitioners in this field from whom to choose judges. As with so much legislation from this place, this is being done in favour of very large companies at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. SMEs and individuals will be seriously disadvantaged in protecting their innovations, by reason of cost and inconvenience, bearing in mind that they will have to go to France and Germany to protect their work rather than to local courts.  We are told that there will be cost savings, but that is not the opinion of experts. One estimate is that litigation costs will increase by a factor of three.

Mr President, England had fundamental rights under the common law for centuries before the concept was dreamed of by the European Union, and we do not need the European Convention on Human Rights to bestow them on us. Those ancient rights and liberties are now being destroyed by the creation of an EU system of criminal law, for example under the infamous European Arrest Warrant. What have your fundamental rights given us in return? Suspects against whom no evidence has been presented to a British court can be extradited and imprisoned for months or years without trial. Meanwhile, we have been prevented from extraditing non-British suspect terrorists and criminals to their own countries outside the European Union because of legal judgments made under the Convention.

 Mr President, of course SIS is an international police database system but also associated with this is an EU police organisation called SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at National Entry). Now this is a little known organisation and it has been described by some of its operatives as top secret. It has executive powers and although Britain is not yet a member of the Schengen Group, the UK is expected to joint SIRENE in 2013. It already has officers working within Member States’ police forces and our German SIRENE officer is attached to the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency and his name is Jan-Per Ruehmann. Under Schengen an alert placed on an SIS database should be treated as a European Arrest Warrant. Therefore within the Schengen area, at least, extradition may now simply be on the basis of the hit on a database. European Arrest Warrants will rise sharply after we join SIS in 2013.

 – Mr President, this report seeks to generate a regulation to restrict members of the public from purchasing, and to require notification concerning sales of, a large number of substances which are commonly used for legitimate purposes. Unfortunately, the UK has extensive experience of the use of home-made explosive devices – for example, terrorists have used fertiliser as a basis for bombs for many years. The UK does not need the EU to tell it how to manage the availability of such substances. This is a regulation which seeks to extend the power and dominion of the EU using the prevention of terrorism as a pretext. I and my UKIP colleagues will therefore vote against. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 – Mr President, I would like to comment on an article in today’s Daily Express
 by Leo McKinstry. He writes that the Tory Party should offer some kind of electoral deal to the UK Independence Party. Now UKIP should never accept any such deal for the following reasons: The Tories can never be trusted. They have betrayed Britain for over 40 years and they would betray anyone. If the Tories wanted to offer the British people a referendum on continued membership of the European Union, they could easily do so. They do not need to make any deal with UKIP. If UKIP entered any such pact, it would destroy our credibility with the electorate. UKIP would end up in the same position as the Liberal Democrats, facing electoral annihilation, and the cause of Britain’s exit from the European Union would be lost forever. UKIP must never compromise its campaign to restore Britain’s status as a sovereign, independent, self-governing democracy. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– The horrors of forced abortions in China is just the latest in decades of abuse and torture of Chinese citizens by their communist Party government. We should not forget that since July 20 1999, former Chinese communist party President, Jiang Zemin, ordered the start of the systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which is still going on. The Amnesty International Annual Report 2012 on China, published on 24th May 2012, states that the Chinese authorities continued to pursue a systematic, nationwide, often violent campaign against Falun Gong; The US State department reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 published on 24th May 2012, where it states that overseas and domestic media and advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting, particularly from Falun Gong practitioners. All of us who care about democratic government should speak out about the last 13 years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China and democratic governments and societies everywhere should send a strong message to the Chinese Government to immediately stop persecuting Falun Gong practitioners in China.

Mr President, since we are discussing justice I would like to raise a disturbing issue that has come to my attention today. Mr Roger Hayes has been summarily sentenced to 21 days in Liverpool prison following a cursory appearance before a magistrate on Monday. Mr Hayes was arrested at 8.30 a.m., taken to court, sentenced and locked up by 6 p.m. that evening. No members of the public or witnesses were reportedly allowed at his hearing. Mr Hayes’ family have reportedly been refused any direct access to him. Mr Hayes is the founder of the British Constitution Group and is a prominent tax protestor. His case arises from his withholding of Council tax on a legally-based objection that the revenue is being illegally used. Mr Hayes’ imprisonment may well be illegal under English common law. Mr Hayes must be freed without delay and the issues behind it widely publicised. I hope this helps. Gerard Batten  (EFD

I can assure these people, and especially my constituents in London, that I and my UKIP colleagues will vote against ACTA. But one element of ACTA which particularly concerns me is the criminalisation of offences under Article 23. Of course, genuine copyright and intellectual property right infringements must be prevented and owners’ rights protected, but the European Union is creating its own comprehensive police state with provisions such as the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order. Criminalisation opens up all kinds of sinister possibilities for suppressing free speech, dissent and alternative points of view. We only have to look at the case of Julian Assange to see where that can lead. All things considered, I urge my colleagues here to vote against ACTA. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, David Cameron has suggested that there might be a referendum on the European Union, but he does not know when and he does not know what the question should be. He only knows what the question will not be: should Britain leave the European Union? This is because he does not know what the EU will look like in the future. But we all know, do we not? Those of us here on both sides of the EU argument know exactly that it is intended to be a single European political state, a United States of Europe. The current eurozone crisis is being used to bring about financial and economic government and full political integration. The only person who apparently does not understand this is David Cameron. The UK Independence Party can explain it to him, exactly as we are explaining it to his voters. The only referendum that the British people want is a straight question on whether we should stay in or get out and we want it sooner rather than later. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania are threatening the EU-Canada trade agreement unless Canada lifts its visa requirement for visitors from those three countries. Canadians do not need visas to visit EU countries, whereas Canada has imposed visa restrictions on these three EU Member States. This is because of a previous influx of people from those countries who outstayed their welcome. Canada takes the quite reasonable view that not all EU countries are the same, and that some pose a particular risk when it comes to unwanted visitors and guests. The Canadians want to pick and choose who they admit and who they do not. However, this realistic view of the world falls foul of the EU ideological view that the EU is, in fact, one country, and to discriminate against one of its regions is not permissible. The Canadian Government already has a very generous system of allowing visa-free entry for 24 EU Member States, but perhaps it has looked at my constituency, London, and seen what a completely unrestricted open-door immigration policy actually delivers. They will not get the visitors and migrants they want – the decent, hard-working and law-abiding – they will also get the down-and-outs, the deadbeats and the criminals. In Marble Arch, the very centre of London, we now have migrants living on the street, with all the unpleasant social and sanitary consequences that involves, which I will leave to your imagination. This is what indiscriminate, visa-free travel can deliver. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement put in jeopardy by Canada’s reluctance to open its doors to allcomers is reputedly worth a potential USD 12 billion per annum, and would boost two-way trade by 20%. What does the world need now? Does it desperately need increased trade? Does it desperately need increased economic activity, jobs and increased prosperity? I think we would all agree that it does. Does it desperately need even more uncontrolled and unlimited migration? Most rational people would think that it does not. Let the Canadians choose who they want to let into their country, and on what terms. Let Canada and Europe get on with increasing the trade between them that can help us all out of the dire economic situation that we find ourselves in. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this report confirms what I have been warning my constituents in London about, and the British people generally, for some years, which is that the EU intends to create its own system of criminal law. This project is already very well advanced and very comprehensive and I have written about it in a report of my own, Freedom, Security &amp; Justice? or The Creation of a European Union Police State
. We do not need an EU system of criminal law in England. We have something called the common law which has taken a thousand years to evolve. We have safeguards under the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and habeas corpus, which are being swept away under this new system. They are being set aside. A British citizen can now be sent off to any corner of the European Union on the strength of a piece of paper with vague accusations. They can be imprisoned for months or years. The English and Scottish courts have abdicated their duty to protect their own citizens from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. Your system of EU criminal law would do for our liberties what the European single currency has done for your economies. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, we are going at such a speed that by the time I hear ‘for, against, abstain’, it is too late to put your hand up. I realise that everybody wants to go to their lunch, but we are either here to vote or we are not.

Mr President, we see increasing moves by governments to limit our personal freedom and privacy, citing the need to protect us from the threat of terrorism and organised crime. However, we have to be extremely cautious in allowing our freedoms to be removed, because once they are gone it is very hard to restore them. We also have to ask if we have any particular reason to trust our governments. Legislation intruding into the citizen’s right to privacy should be proportionate, limited and controlled. Once it is enacted we need to be sure that its scope cannot be widened at the whim of government. This kind of legislation should never have been proposed by the Commission in the first place. It probably comes under the jurisdiction of international law. It should be devised under international agreements by sovereign nation states. The legislation is also unacceptable because it is one-way traffic between Europe and the USA. We have to give them our citizens’ personal information, but they do not have to supply theirs. The motion for a resolution wants the final decision to be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union to rule on its legality and compatibility with the EU Treaties. The UK Independence Party’s MEPs will vote against this legislation. We will not vote in favour of the motion as we do not accept the legitimacy of the European Court. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

Madam President, last year I wrote to David Cameron urging him to oppose the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The coalition government replied that they were obligated to accede to it and that in any case it would not change the existing situation regarding the UK. EU accession to the ECHR is required under Article 6(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Cameron could have given the decision to the British people by honouring his promise, indeed his cast-iron guarantee, of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. He reneged on that promise after the Labour Government had ratified the Treaty. But treaties are ratified by acts of parliament, and any act can be repealed. If he had wanted to, he could have repealed the ratification act and then submitted Lisbon to a referendum of the people. Instead he betrayed his promise and his guarantee turned out to be worthless. Now the government tells us not to worry anyway, because it makes no difference. But this is not true either. Britain could not opt out of or reform the Convention even if it wanted to, because we are bound by the Treaty of Lisbon. As usual the Tories betrayed Britain. Now they are in denial about the consequences of that betrayal. They had a solution and they did not use it. Now the only solution is the one advocated by the UK Independence Party, which is for Britain to leave the European Union.

Madam President, I have never advocated that Britain should leave the United Nations, which is a properly-constituted international body. It has always been my view, and it has been the policy of my party, that Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights and that we should repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. So I think I and my party have been entirely consistent in that. Gerard Batten  (EFD
),  
blue-card question. –
 We come from completely opposite views on this and I do not think we are ever going to agree, but I have come across a curious anomaly which I would like your view on. The European Convention on Human Rights has been used by people like Abu Hamza and terrorist suspects to prevent their extradition to countries like America on the basis that their human rights might be abused. But I have sat in courts dealing with European Arrest Warrant cases, and one in particular where the European Convention was invoked because it was almost certain that, in being extradited to Greece, suspects would be held in the Korydallos Prison, where it was 100% guaranteed that their human rights were going to be violated. But the government prosecutor put the point that since Greece was a signatory of the Convention on Human Rights it could not be deemed to be in breach of it. The appeal court agreed and the suspects were extradited. Is it not odd that foreign countries are covered by the European Convention on Human Rights but it does not seem to apply in European countries and does not offer the protection that we would give to people being extradited to the USA? Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, the harmonisation of EU social security systems does not, of course, mean the harmonisation of the benefit systems themselves – that would be unachievable – but rather the harmonisation of access to those systems by all EU citizens. What this means is that many social security claimants will gravitate to those states with the most generous systems. In Britain, nearly five million people are on the council house waiting list, with little prospect of getting a home, but in some London boroughs, almost 50% of social housing is given to people not born in the UK. Many of these people will never have paid a penny in tax and will be living on state benefits. Of course there is no point in homeless Londoners emigrating to other EU Member States to seek homes and income on their social security systems because the benefits will not be as reciprocal. No one should gain public housing or benefits in Britain until they have paid tax for a considerable period of time. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, jobs which could easily be saved are being lost in London because of EU legislation. The Tate and Lyle sugar refinery in the borough of Newham has been forced to cut back on production and lay off 30 staff. This is because, under EU quota rules, they cannot buy the raw sugar they need within the EU. However, the Commission has the power to change the rules and allow Tate and Lyle to buy what they need on the world market. I wrote to Commissioner Cioloş on 14 March, asking him to urgently meet with Tate and Lyle so they could put their case for resolving the problem. So far, I have not had a reply. We cannot afford to lose these jobs in one of the poorest parts of London. I urge Commissioner Cioloş to meet with Tate and Lyle as soon as possible in order to reach a solution. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I object to there being a roll-call vote because we have had this before. There is a clear procedure for requesting a roll-call vote. If people want one, then they should follow that. If we allow a roll-call vote on this because somebody requests it, then we could all request roll-call votes on all the bits that interest us, could we not? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, I know that Mr Helmer is something of an expert on this subject, and wonder whether he can confirm or deny something that I have read in the press, which is that if Britain closed down all of its industry, took every British aeroplane out of the sky and every British car off the road, this would not actually make any discernible difference to the world output of CO2
 emission gases. In fact, if we completely closed everything down, it would have no effect at all. Can he state whether that is true or not? Gerard Batten, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, this regulation is the thin end of yet another wedge. The danger is that it will lead to an EU law of property ownership. An EU certificate of succession is a short step away from a European probate registry and the introduction of an EU property tax. Now, I doubt that many people in England realise that we are debating the EU’s intention to take control of inheritance law. The one good thing I can say about this is that the British Government has exercised its opt-out. It has not done that out of any principle – it does not have any any principles where the EU is concerned and there is only so much that you can get past the British public at any one time. What amazes me is not that they have opted out but that there was ever any serious intention of opting in. I was going to address myself to the MEPs here but as there are so few of them it is quite a redundant statement this evening. Anyway, some MEPs might like to consider the wisdom of handing yet more control to the EU in this area and vote with MEPs from the UK Independence Party against it. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I just want to draw your attention to the fact that the first amendment on this report does not seem to have appeared on the Séance en Direct
 website this morning. It would normally appear there where it can easily be seen by all the assistants preparing the voting list. I am reliably informed that this is the first time this appears to have happened in the experience of our assistants in five years of preparing voting lists. Not all Members may be aware of its existence, and I wish to draw your attention to it. If you vote for this, then the whole of the rest of the motion falls. It is in support of the Hungarians being free to determine their own constitution without pressure from the EU. I would like to say that, but also I would be very grateful if you could conduct an investigation and let us know why it did not appear properly this morning. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, I just wanted to add to what Mr Helmer said. Mr Helmer is well aware that flying the Union flag upside down is a signal of distress, so it is entirely appropriate that it should be flown upside down in this place. I would recommend that we fly it that way permanently. (Laughter) Gerard Batten  (EFD

Madam President, I have had hundreds of e-mails from my constituents on the subject of ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. ACTA intends to take alleged infringements of copyright, patents and trademarking from the jurisdiction of civil law to criminal law. Intellectual property rights have to be protected but ACTA, like so much legislation that comes from this place, favours the interest of big business over small business and individuals. If this comes under criminal law, the great danger is that alleged transgressors could be extradited on European arrest warrants to the four corners of the European Union to face months or years in prison. I and my colleagues in the UK Independence Party are once again the voice of the people in this place. UK Independence Party MEPs oppose ACTA and we will vote against it when the time comes. We urge all MEPs to do the same. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, the BBC is currently broadcasting a series entitled ‘Putin, Russia and the West’. In the second programme, Tony Blair’s former aide Jonathan Powell recounts the famous ‘spy rock’ scandal story. The Kremlin had accused MI6 of funding Russian human rights groups and other NGOs and using a fake rock located in a Moscow square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents. Mr Powell confirmed this story (whether it is true or not), and the BBC elevated it to the status of a scoop by issuing a press release. The FSB reacted promptly, publicly accusing two leading NGOs – Memorial and Golos – of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by the West. Both organisations are now under systematic harassment by the authorities. Powell’s claim is either untrue or illegal under the Official Secrets Act. The BBC is guilty of gross journalistic irresponsibility, and this shows once again that Putin’s is a gangster regime. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I agree with Mr Nuttall but I do not think he goes far enough. Surely this is a disgrace and surely it raises a quandary for sports fans because, for example, in the World Cup, if the national flag and the EU flag are being displayed, then who are sports fans supporting – their country or the EU? Would Mr Nuttall not agree with me that they cannot support the EU because it is not a country? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, this directive calls for common rights for third-party migrants working in the EU. If adopted it would remove what little rights remain or are still left to Member States to determine their own immigration policy. It wants third-party migrants to enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals, including working conditions, social security and access to public services. But of course not all Member States have the same level of social security and public services, and of course a citizen of a state, by definition, enjoys the benefits of that citizenship, or should enjoy the benefits of that citizenship that non-citizens do not. If citizens do not have exclusive rights, then the concept of citizenship itself is meaningless. What this will mean is that third-party migrants will flood to those states that have the highest levels of public housing, social security and public services. No prizes for guessing that Britain will be top of their list as a destination. Equally unsurprisingly, I can tell you that UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this directive.

 I know that may be technically true, but we seem to get saddled with these directives in time anyway. I am sure that we will not be able to wriggle out of it for very long, in the same way as we get all kinds of people turning up in our country and taking benefits in the social security and housing system, although they have got no rights to them. We know that for a fact. So while I hope that you are right and there will be a way of avoiding this, I think that in practice we will not. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, this directive includes the right to information for persons facing a European arrest warrant. In the case of an EAW, it will have to be a short letter. Subjects of EAWs effectively have no meaningful rights. Provided that the form has been correctly completed, the court has no power to refuse extradition. The court cannot base its decision on the prima facie evidence – or the lack of it – against the accused person. What is worse is that some people are being extradited, not after being charged, but to face investigation. One of my constituents in London, Dr Miguel-Ángel Meizoso, is facing extradition to Spain, not for something that he is alleged to have done, but for something he is accused of that he might possibly do in the future. If you do not believe me, I can give you the case papers. An English court would reject his extradition if it had any power to do so. Giving Dr Meizoso a nice letter will not protect him and will be small consolation. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I would like to address Mr Barroso. You always tell the same story which is more of the same: more Europe, not less Europe. Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity was to keep on doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. You propose yet more swathes of legislation and yet more power to the EU. You have previously said that the EU must assume economic and financial fiscal governance of the Member States. Where has all this centralisation of power actually got you? The EU underperforms economically with the rest of the world, mainly because of the burden of job-destroying and prosperity-restricting legislation. The crises in Greece and Italy have been, in part, caused by their membership of the European single currency. Instead of organising an orderly exit, they have had to sacrifice democratic government and have it replaced by rule by economists and technocrats. You propose yet more of the same thing and expect different results. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to predict the result. Gerard Batten,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, the European Union is becoming increasingly unpopular with citizens across the continent. It is rightly seen as out of touch, undemocratic and dictatorial. The euro, its grand unifying political project, is collapsing round its ears. Greece and Italy are the first to pay the price by having undemocratic government imposed on them. So what does the Commission do to halt this decline in popularity? It comes up with vain and crass projects in an effort to make itself appear more relevant to Member States. First, it attempted to place the EU flag – which is not meant to exist anyway – on the sports kits of national teams. Then it calls for the EU flag to be flown at sporting events, and now it comes up with the crackpot idea of EU heritage labels. In the report, it says that these EU heritage sites would be monuments, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and even places of remembrance. What an insult! Are you really suggesting that war memorials which honour the brave and fallen in two World Wars should have an EU plaque placed on them? There is only one memorial in England I can think of where it would be appropriate to stick an EU plaque, and that is the gravestone of Ted Heath, the man who betrayed Britain into the European Union. I do not think anyone would object to that, least of all him. The report also says that the plaque’s aim is to strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU. It will not: it will just enrage the natives. It is just desperate propaganda from an organisation to which more and more people do not wish to belong. I urge all MEPs who are proud of the heritage of their own nations to vote for my group’s rejection amendment tomorrow. Let us stick the European Heritage Label on the dustbin of history. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this own-initiative report on the Professional Qualifications Directive is another piece of ideologically-driven harmonisation. It calls for minimum training requirements, automatic recognition and the removing of formal obstacles to recognition of professional qualifications. It goes on to say that ‘only if necessary should language tests be part of the recognition process and cannot be an additional border to mobility’. Most normal people would want professional qualifications, especially medical qualifications, to be subject to maximum, not minimum, standards – and not speaking the language properly should very much be a bar to practising and mobility. There is a case that clearly demonstrates the dangers. In 2008, a German-qualified doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani, was convicted in England of gross negligence and manslaughter after he over prescribed drugs to a patient. This directive means we cannot discriminate against EU professionals, while we must discriminate against properly-qualified fluent English speakers from the Commonwealth. This is another good reason, if we needed one, why Britain should leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in recent months, England has seen a series of despicable crimes: memorial plaques recording the names of the heroic dead of two world wars are being systematically stolen for their scrap metal value. Decent English people wonder how these revered monuments which have stood safely in cities, towns and villages for generations have become the targets for thieves. Today’s Daily Express
 reports that the police believe that these crimes are predominantly carried out by Romanian gangs. The EU’s open door policy is directly to blame; we do not just get the decent, honest, hard-working migrants that we might choose. We are forced to take the lowest forms of criminal life merely because they are EU citizens. Membership of the EU is destroying my country. What more revolting proof of that could there be than the melting down for scrap of the monuments to those who gave their lives so we could be free. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, demographics, of course, is a fascinating subject, and behind great historical developments and changes there is often an untold demographic story. Britain is now undergoing a massive population explosion which, until very recently, went unreported. When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997, we had a population of just over 58 million. That population has now grown to over 62.4 million and, on current trends, the population will grow to over 70 million by 2030 and thereafter spiral ever upwards. Demographers calculate that all this unsustainable population growth is down to migration and births to migrants. There is nothing wrong with some appropriate, moderate and sustainable immigration, but the UK is adding over one million people to its net population every four to five years. England is more densely populated than India, China and Japan. Britain does not have a cohesion policy, but if it did, it would leave the European Union and regain control of its borders and its immigration policy. Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, and thank you, Mr Bisky, you mention in your speech that anti-Europe sentiment and feeling was gaining ground. Can I ask you to accept that there is a clear distinction between anti-European Union feeling and anti-Europe? The people who are anti the European Union of the political construction, like me, are very pro-Europe. Would you please accept that there is a clear distinction there and we should stop talking about anti-European sentiment and start talking about anti-European Union sentiment? Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the so-called ‘six pack’ imposes economic rule on the Member States via the European Union. The English Parliament established in the reign of King Edward I that its key reason for existing was control of the public finances. In 1642 the English fought a Civil War and then cut off a King’s head precisely in order to establish its sole right to levy taxes. Now, not by means of an Act of Parliament, but by means of a regulation from the European Union, the British Government is expected to meekly accept financial control by the European Union. If it does, there can no longer be any pretence that Britain is a sovereign nation or a democracy. The British Government should reject and repudiate these regulations and defend the rights of Parliament. To do otherwise is abject surrender. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 The architects of the European Single Currency are to blame for the crisis that now faces the eurozone. The euro was never an economic project. It was a political project designed to help bring about a United States of Europe. Once of the vital attributes of a state is its currency and that is why the European Union forced through the introduction of the euro against all the sensible advice against it. You do not have to be an economist to know that to constrain a number of completely different economies within a single interest rate and exchange rate will, over time, bring nothing but problems and eventual disaster. That is what we are seeing now, and of course Mr Barroso is calling for full economic and financial governance of the eurozone countries by the European Union. The crisis was entirely predictable and so was Mr Barroso’s proposed solution. The euro is going to come apart. It is just a question of time. The longer it takes the worse the crash is going to be. The people to blame are those who forced the economies of the eurozone into an economic straightjacket in order to serve a political dogma. Gerard Batten,

– Madam President, there is indeed a massive problem with illegal immigration into Europe. The effects of this problem are especially felt in England and, in particular, in my constituency of London. England attracts immigration – illegal and legal – because of the possibilities for work and our generous benefits and housing systems. The UK Independence Party would not be opposed to genuine cooperation between European nation states to counter the problems of illegal immigration – but this proposal is not about genuine cooperation. It seeks to change the legal basis on which Frontex operates and gives it more so-called competences. It will, for example, give Frontex the ability to cooperate with third-party countries on behalf of the EU. This proposal is yet another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. The proposal is another step in introducing the European Union’s common immigration and asylum policy as enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. As I will never tire of saying, the Lisbon Treaty was undemocratically imposed on the peoples of Europe without their consent. The Lisbon Treaty was illegal under existing English constitutional law, and everything that stems from it is therefore illegal in England. There is another problem here, which is the European Convention on Human Rights. British courts are obligated to protect the human rights of foreign nationals in the UK. Once in the UK, they only have to claim that their human rights are likely to be at risk in their own country and the courts will not send them home. As a result of this, we have given refuge to all kinds of criminals. If I heard him correctly, Mr Busuttil said that all operations would be suspended while a human rights issue was being considered. This is like baling out a boat with a bucket that has an enormous hole in the bottom. The UK Independence Party will vote against this proposal. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Frontex report because it is nation states and not EU agencies which should control and patrol national borders. Frontex is an affront to British freedom. This latest move is simply a power grab by the EU to give Frontex more money, personnel, equipment and powers. This vote gives the wrong powers to the wrong people. This proposal is another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Galileo programme as an expensive, useless and void EU project which alleges to replace the GPS system and, for example, enhance border security, but, in fact, is an ambitious project which merely seeks to promote the EU brand globally. Taxpayers’ money must be spent on more reasonable projects than sending into space EU-labelled satellites in order to compete with the USA. The purpose of Galileo is to further the EU’s plans for one military force to which I am totally opposed. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against this report as it reflects yet another example of an EU attempt to grab sovereign prerogatives of the nations in the region of the South Pacific. The EU is usurping the right to decide on matters which should remain in the hands of poor communities perfectly capable of managing their fishing and maritime preservation. Poorer nations from the South Pacific should keep the right to use their fishery resources freely to retain their independence and avoid the risk of massive emigration. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I am minded to quote the great American philosopher Murray Rothbard here, that the state is an institution of theft writ large. Tax is just about a system where politicians and bureaucrats steal money from their citizens, to squander in the most disgraceful manner. This place is no exception. Fascinatingly – and I really do not know how they manage to keep a straight face when they are talking about tax evasion – the whole Commission and the Commission bureaucracy avoid their taxes. They do not pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. They have all sorts of special deals – composite tax rates, high tax thresholds, non-contributory pension schemes. They are the biggest tax avoiders in Europe and here they sit pontificating. Well, I would point out to the Commission that the message is getting home to the people of the European Union. You are going to find that Eurosceptics are coming back in June in ever greater numbers. And I can tell you worse: as the people get your number, it will not be long before they storm this Chamber and they hang you, and they will be right. Godfrey Bloom,

. – 
Mr President, not for the first time I rise to give the House the benefit of my 35 years’ experience in financial services – rather more, I suspect, than the rest of you put together. Let me put you right on how this all started. It started with something called the Community Reinvestment Act in the USA, and the reason the whole thing has gone wrong is political interference. We have been talking today, have we not, about due diligence in banking? Well, the Community Reinvestment Act actually stopped banks carrying out due diligence checks. It became illegal to inquire of a borrower whether he could or could not repay the loan, and that is when you saw the invention of subprime mortgages, which had never existed before. It was political interference in the market which caused the subprime crisis. Add to that the bubble in the property market created by criminal, fraudulent central bankers printing money and artificially restraining interest rates, as central banks are still doing now. The US Federal Reserve is still doing it, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England: they are all at it, counterfeiting money. So we are lending money now at far too cheap a rate. We just print more money, and we are going to have another bubble and we are going to do the whole thing all over again! Allow me to close with one point which you clearly do not understand: if it is impossible to foreclose on a mortgage, nobody will give you a mortgage. That is how the market works. Leave it to the market, caveat emptor, and let people get on with it without interference from politicians who, frankly, do not know what they are talking about. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, I wonder if you will permit me to gallop through the working day of the average Englishman. He wakes up and turns on his taxed television to get the news; he leaves his heavily taxed house; gets in his heavily taxed car; he fills it with heavily taxed diesel. He then gets to work to earn an income which, after income tax, employer and employee national insurance, is reduced by a third. He drives home and stops on the high street for a few articles for the house. His purchases are taxed at 20%. He calls in for a pint, over two-thirds of the cost of which goes in tax. He dreams of a family holiday abroad, but he cannot afford the airport tax. He longs for the day that he can retire, but the politicians will not let him go.  We must steal his savings, must we not, through the financial transaction tax? The poor sap does not even know we have nicked it. Of course, with the Commission’s top income-tax-free salaries and non-contributory pension schemes, it is difficult for you to imagine his distress, is it not? You are not in this game, are you? You do not pay any of this. You do not pay any of this. On a more technical note, I draw the House's attention to my own lunatic committee’s Amendment 39 to Article 4a on the withdrawal of legal title to untaxed transactions anywhere in the world. This is sugar in the petrol tank, if you will. We are very much looking forward to the vote. We are watching to see which imbeciles commend it. I suspect it will be usual parliamentarian flat-earthers. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

Madam President, as a matter of fact, I am not without some sympathy with the Council on this because you are trying to do the impossible. I think Parliament is trying to make you do the impossible.  The long and short of it is – as well known in Austrian economics – that, in order to regulate financial services, you would need perfect knowledge of the market. That is impossible and cannot be done. It is sometimes know as the fatal conceit. What we need to go back to is liberty of contract so that the individual, the investor, can contract under law in a property-owning democracy with whomsoever banker or investment manager he wants, without the interference of the state and the implicit guarantee of the taxpayer that goes with it. Central bankers and retail bankers hide behind regulation. They are not dominated or guided by regulation. It is what keeps these people out of prison when they cheat the general public. You are part of the conspiracy. For goodness sake, move away from prescriptive regulation and let the law of the land take its course. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

Mr President, my sincere apologies for not being on parade. It is quite unlike me. I do apologise for it and thank you for your courtesy. Interesting, is it not, that one of the great political questions in the United Kingdom when it comes to discussion of the euro is: cock-up or conspiracy. Is it a cock-up or is it a conspiracy? We are still arguing about that in the pubs of England. We are not quite sure. It must be completely obvious to anybody with even the remotest bit of economic understanding that this common currency was doomed to failure from the outset if it was not accompanied by fiscal policy. It must have fiscal policy to have one currency and one interest rate. It comes with the package. It must be part of the same phenomenon. The conspiracies theorists say, ah: they knew that this would happen, that this would collapse and that this would bring grief to many countries unfortunate enough and stupid enough to be part of this common currency, and what will happen is, when it collapses – when it catches fire, when it all goes wrong – they can then (‘they’ being the conspirators) push through an undemocratic system of government on people, whether they like it or not. I think this is the first part of it. This is what we are looking at with this document. It is the first bit of an undemocratic procedure so we can cut ordinary voters – members of the electorate – out of the system.

It depends on your perspective really, does it not? I would argue that there is no remit for a common fiscal policy. It has not been put to the people, either in a referendum or in any political way that I can see – certainly not in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, as you know, we have been promised but denied in reality a referendum for many years. I can only speak for the United Kingdom, but I would argue that there is no democratic remit for this and therefore you cannot push a common fiscal policy through. If you ask the people on the streets of Rome or Madrid, or Lisbon or Athens, I think you will get your answer. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Madam President, I find it interesting when I listen to these debates. The House always seems to imagine that there is some huge tree with money on it and you just pick the money off. Well, we have heard all about poverty, we have heard all about unemployment – all of it is true. Perhaps you will bear with me while I explain why. We have a crazy system of both corporate and social welfare. It is a failed post-war experiment. We have a system in the United Kingdom where we pay perfectly fit, healthy young men and women not to work. We import people from Eastern Europe to do that work. So we are pouring money into a complete dead-end of our economy and, in order to pay for it, we have to have things like 20% VAT, monstrous income tax and monstrous national insurance, which actually hamstring the economy from recovering. The only way out of this terrible mess is growth, and we do just about everything we can possibly do here to stop the economy growing. If it is not social welfare, it is corporate welfare. We have a sort of crony capitalism. We do not have real capitalism; it is crony capitalism. I have got landowning friends in Yorkshire, with 1 000 acres of mixed, who get GBP 100 000 a year and a single farm payment. They shove a couple of windmills on it and they are getting GBP 200 000 a year before they get out of bed. Of course people are in food poverty with this crazy system. For goodness sake, get rid of regulation, get rid of tax and free the thing up from this stranglehold, this cancer in society of welfare and get our young people back to work. Godfrey Bloom,

Madam President, Commissioner, I rise again, I am afraid, to make the same old hoary speech that I have been making here for several years. That is: it is my opinion that you do not really understand the concept of banking. All the banks are broke. Bank Santander, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland: they are all broke. And why are they broke? It is not an act of God; it is not some sort of tsunami. They are broke because we have a system called fractional reserve banking, which means that banks can lend money that they do not actually have. It is a criminal scandal and it has been going on for too long. To add to that problem you have moral hazard – a very significant moral hazard – from the political sphere, and most of the problems start in politics and central banks, which are part of the same political system. We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitative easing, but counterfeiting  by any other name – the artificial printing of money for which, if any ordinary person did it,  they would be sent to prison for a very long time. Yet governments and central banks do it all the time. Central banks repress the amount of interest rates so we do not have the real cost of money, and yet we blame the retail banks for manipulating the LIBOR rate. The sheer effrontery of this is quite astonishing. It is central banks that manipulate interest rates, Commissioner. Plus, underneath all this, we talk loosely – in a rather cavalier fashion, do we not – about deposit guarantees. So when banks go broke through their own incompetence and chicanery, the taxpayer picks up the tab. It is theft from the taxpayer. Until we start sending bankers – and I include central bankers and politicians – to prison for this outrage, it will continue. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, what we are dealing with here is a triumph of hope over experience. We are talking about things which are not the problem; the problem which we have is a flawed banking system – a fractional reserve banking system where bankers can lend money that they do not have. If you go back in time to the United States in the 1850s, that was a capital offence. You could hang for it. We have this extraordinary situation where we have had regulation – lots of regulation – which has been the wrong sort of regulation, has it not? And so we have had another disaster. None of this is actually going to save us from another disaster further down the line. It is bound to happen, because we have not addressed the real problems, and that is the EU’s fractional reserve banking system. We must have a commodity bank on the one hand and an investment bank on the other. So, Commissioner, you talk about the banks’ ability to withstand shocks. Well, by that definition – by your definition – a shock is people turning up wanting their money back. That is not a shock; that should be a day-to-day occurrence and should be dealt with accordingly. We are talking about bankers’ bonuses, which is an absolutely wonderful way of taking everybody’s eye off the ball. What we have actually had here is criminal activity by banks – and not a single banker has been sent to prison. That is extraordinary: billions of pounds have been taken away from taxpayers, taken away from depositors and bondholders, and yet not a single banker is in jail. That is a disgrace! We really have to use the law of the land, not so much regulation and printing money – and central banks are equally culpable, make no mistake. I would like to see some central bankers in prison. I call ‘quantitative easing’ counterfeiting. Printing money is counterfeiting. It is illegal; if a private citizen did it, they would go to jail. So let us look into our own hearts. All the very unpleasant arrangements that politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers have between them at the expense of the taxpayer, let us end them and let us end them now. Godfrey Bloom,

Madam President, Commissioner. You know, Mr Draghi, that I am always impressed by your totally non-compromising support for the euro, doomed though we all now know it to be. It appeals to this certain Englishman – there is a sort of Shakespearian quality, I have to say: Lear-like. It puts me in mind of his great speech: ‘I will do such things, – What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be the Terrors of the earth’. Can I make a plea for my friends and their families in Cyprus? A micro-brewer who had his savings in a bank to start a micro-brewing company – not a rich man at all, but of course it was more than EUR 100 000, because it was his life savings. A retired British army officer whose life savings have now all but disappeared in the great Cypriot bank heist. Of course the big boys got their money out early, didn’t they? It is always the little people who get shafted, isn’t it? I am not totally convinced that you really care about them. Can you give me an assurance that you will do whatever it takes to get these poor people’s money back? We now have a situation which the previous speaker, Mr Eppink, alluded to quite rightly: the FED, the Bank of England, the ECB and the Bank of Japan are all completely bankrupt, and they are holding mountains of junk bonds bought with counterfeit money. Let us all blame the retail banks – but it is the central banks where the cancer starts. Politicians, bankers and lackey bureaucrats should be arraigned at an international financial tribunal in The Hague in the same way as war criminals.

 Let me assure you that United Kingdom politicians and central bankers are no less stupid than the people out here or the people in Washington. Believe me, they disgust me just as much. They have absolutely no idea, and they are bankrupting the United Kingom just the same way this organisation is bankrupting Western Europe. Yes, I take your point very well. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

 Mr President, well what do we know about carbon dioxide? Not carbon – carbon dioxide is a different thing for those people in this Chamber who have not had the benefit of a formal education. They are different things. We know that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere always follows periods of global warming. We know, do we not, that the hypothesis that man-made global warming was going to cause totally apocryphal boiling in 2050 now is completely nonsense. The hypothesis is dead in the water. It is facedown. There has been no statistically significant global warming now for over fifteen years. There is not a single independent scientific institution which does not acknowledge that fact. So all this debate is a lot of nonsense, because it simply is not happening. And Commissioner, you say that the weather is getting worse and worse; that climate change is getting worse. Madam, where have you been? It has not been. Why are you in denial? You are in denial! If I may lapse into the vernacular of the loony Greenies and their fellow travellers on this complete money-making nonsense: denier! Denier! (The speaker declined to answer blue-card questions from Mr Davies and Mr Jørgensen) Godfrey Bloom,

Mr President, let us look at VAT, shall we? What is it really? Well, of course it is a tax, so it is just a form of extortion by the State confiscating money from ordinary working people for the State to spend on itself. It is bureaucracy, politicians, subsidies for cronies and donors to party funds. The tax is regressive and monstrous – 20 % in the United Kingdom. It is inflationary, obviously, with 20 % on all goods. It is closing down retailers in the high street. Manufacturers are on three-day weeks. In the UK manufacturing has fallen 35 % in the last few years.  And what a silly tax it is. It is paid and reclaimed throughout the life of a transaction. It is not applied when value is added, whatever that may mean, but at the end so the customer pays it or simply withdraws his custom. So you get a recession. Notwithstanding the draconian powers given to VAT collectors, worthy of the old East German secret police – and I know some of you want to bring that back – fraud is rife. As criminals are always more clever than politicians – hey, what is the difference? – fraud will remain. If you really want to get rid of fraud, get rid of the tax. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

blue-card question
. –
 Thank you for taking the question. I just thought that as we are talking about waking up and we are talking about climate change, I would draw it to your attention – you keep missing the point I think – that there is no scientific institution now in the world which does not accept that there has been no significance statistical climate change since 1995. I am just wondering when you are going actually to wake up to that fact? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, I get the impression that Members think that if they use the word ‘growth’ enough, it will somehow magically manifest itself. The reason that growth is unacceptably low is actually quite simple, as anybody from the Pacific Rim could tell us. The reason it is low is that we are overtaxed, overregulated and over-governed. Most Members of this House and the Commission have never had a job in the commercial sector. This is an Achilles’ heel of gargantuan proportions. We have a suicidal energy policy. Employment legislation makes it impossible to employ anybody, especially small businesses and particularly young people. There will be no economic growth until we can close down this place, and the Commission. This is part of the problem. We are the problem and not the solution. Yet perhaps it will close itself down. Perhaps, and maybe sooner than we think. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Mr President, we are very interested to see how people vote on what is a very important subject. I draw your attention to Rule 161(5). A little transparency, even in this place, would not go amiss. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Mr President, this is a very complicated subject. Of course the credit rating agencies were not blameless in the subprime crisis, nor in the credit crunch that followed. Lord knows I have castigated them in this Chamber enough, but since 2008 they have improved. They have been honest with the markets about the worthless government debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, if not yet the United Kingdom and the United States.  But are we to crush the rating agencies with regulation?  Recall how they rate government debt: you require the rating agencies to get the prior approval of the regulator, ESMA, for their methodologies so that you can manipulate the calculations behind the scenes. Then, in order to control when they publicise their work, you force the rating agencies to disclose to ESMA the dates on which they are going to provide ratings on government debt and to limit those dates to three times a year. This is so that you will not suffer the embarrassment of a downgrade or negative outlook just before a critical auction of government paper. Then, to control where the rating agencies work, you insist that some of the work is done in the jurisdiction of government debt so that you can intimidate the analysts in the same way that the offices of credit rating agencies have been raided by government bodies in places such as Italy. Then, to control who does the work, you insist not only on the rotation of credit rating agencies themselves, but also on the individual analysts who work and have experience on particular debt and the assets that back them. Finally, to control the purpose of providing credit ratings, you seek to remove references to and reliance upon ratings, both within the workings of government and in private investment funds. Much of this is actually an attack on free speech. The world is watching you, frankly. Can you be trusted? I believe that this is a regulation to castrate the rating agencies and turn them into government eunuchs to vainly protect the chastity of the euro, a currency born out of wedlock and without a dowry. I fear that we will find ourselves back exactly in the position where we started. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I rise somewhat wearily to explain yet again the banking crisis to this House. Banks lend long, but borrow short. Central banks encourage malpractice by printing money – counterfeiting by any other name. Politicians use this fake money to prop up corporate and social welfare, basically bribing people with their own money. Financial regulation has become a shield to protect crooked bankers, while politicians, central and commercial banks spend money they do not have. The problem will simply fester. So what of banking union? Will national parliaments have any say? I take this opportunity to ask, as there are British Conservative colleagues in the House tonight, will Cameron stop this? Will he invoke Article 127 of the TEU or will he, as form suggests, sit like a paralysed rabbit in the EU’s headlights? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a financial transaction tax sounds like a very good idea, does it not? It plays well politically, and we can hit those greedy bankers, whom we all hate in public while we shovel money into their pockets in private. However, I do not think it is quite going to work out that way. All taxes are passed on to customers at the end of the day – sorry everybody, but that is just how it works – so again it will be the little people who pick up the tab. It will be savers, it will be pensioners and it will be ordinary folk who pick up the tab for this tax, not the greedy fat-cat bankers that you are trying to get at. It is interesting, when you look at the small print, to see they are saying that some of the money raised can perhaps go towards saving future failed banks. So we know – we concede, do we not? – that more banks are going to fail. We know this because we have the same ridiculous, fractional-reserve banking system, the same crooked, money-printing, criminal behaviour at the central banks, and so on and so forth. So nothing has changed. This is another strong signal to bankers and politicians to continue the theft. But beware those who think that taxing London is a risk-free game – and we mean London don’t we? When it comes to financial services, other EU countries are Mickey Mouse. Financial services account for 14% of UK GDP, and the UK contributes GBP 50 million pounds a day to this crumbling institution. Do not kill the goose that lays your golden eggs! Zurich, Geneva, New York and Hong Kong are licking their lips wondering what piece of glorious stupidity we will come up with next. An FTT is a special tax, so what next? A special tax on sunshine holidays in Spain; high fashion in Paris; luxury cars in Germany; mobile phones in Finland; and perhaps a justifiably special tax on dreadful flat-pack furniture from Sweden? It is coming to your street next! The greedy bureaucrats just want your money. (Applause)

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr Maňka, no, the problem we have is fractional-reserve banking, which means that banks lend money that they do not have, and that central banks and politicians print money, degrading currency. That is your problem. It is not regulation, it is not taxation. It is because of criminal behaviour, frankly, at the world’s central banks. Until that stops, nothing is going to change. There are a lot more bank failures coming down the road, believe me. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, harmonised taxation is simply a ploy to enable bureaucrats to steal even more money from the wealth-creating sector. Like vampires, they prey upon ordinary folk, sucking the lifeblood out of the economy – and for what? Tax-free salaries, non-contributive pension schemes, winter sunshine trips to Durban and Cancún, suicidal remote energy policies and constant rescue packages for failed banks. Without tax competition, Europe would be bled white in pursuit of a maniacal political crusade. High tax would banish manufacturing to the Far East, the Indian subcontinent and North America. The Baltic States, Ireland and fellow entrepreneurial ex-Warsaw Pact countries would slip back into the abyss. Athens and Madrid would become Dublin and Warsaw, but I suspect that before that time, ordinary folk will have cried enough and the parasites will have to head for the hills, as well they may. For certain the Irish, I suspect, will have their own way of dealing with them when they eventually awake from their slumber. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, in the 1970s the Community Reinvestment Act in the United States made due diligence in banking illegal. To pursue a political goal, the Administration laid open the pathway to what we now know as sub-prime debt. It proved to be – as I said it would at the time – a pathway to hell paved with good intentions. It was conceived to make banks lend to people who could not possibly repay. We politicians now love to blame the banks, but it started with politics. Sadly, politicians do not understand money. How else could we have got ourselves into this appalling mess? Yet we have learnt nothing; we are now advocating a form of Eurobond, a sub-prime debt instrument by any other name. Again, we are bailing out the banks at the expense of the taxpayer. The ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed are all at it: print money; give it to the banks to buy junk bonds – bogusly rated as double A – to shore up their reserves and guarantee salaries and bonuses that ordinary people can only wonder at. We have learnt nothing from the 2008 crisis. We are desperately clinging to a failed political ideal as our cities riot and burn. The day must surely come when politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers must be called to account by a fiscal crimes tribunal and sent to prison for a very long time. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Mr President, as a supporter and sponsor of Cambridge University’s Ladies’ Rugby Club for, I guess, 15 to 20 years, I wonder whether they should wear the logo on the front of their shirts or on the back? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I hope I may call you ‘shipmate’ in private! I would like to welcome the President of the Bank and to thank him for turning up, even if nobody else has. I have read this report, unlike most of my colleagues probably: power to suspend credit ratings, a European Monetary Fund to exclude the IMF, a single European Treasury issuing eurobonds and a single European Finance Minister, all of which, of course, would be unelected. It is a manifesto for European economic dictatorship, which is why I rather suspect the British Conservative Party will welcome it with open arms. If they do not vote for it, they will abstain in a marked manner, as they usually do, and talk a good story back in London. The President of the Bank reminds me a little bit of the poem by Siegfried Sassoon, the great war poet: ‘He’s a cheery old card’ said Harry to Jack, ‘As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack, But he did for them both with his plan of attack’. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, Ms Gáll-Pelcz mentioned the purchase of risky assets and I am a little bit confused. I am a professional economist. With whose money would you buy these risky assets? With whose money? Where would you get the money? Is it from old age pensioners in Yorkshire – my constituency – on GBP 100 per week? Where are you going to get the money to save this already failed project? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I certainly do not want it to fail but there is a feeling in the House that we have been hit by an asteroid or a tsunami, that this is not a problem of our own making. The reason the country and the European Union is in a shambles over the euro is of our own making: we have brought this upon ourselves. It is not an act of God. When will this House wake up to the fact we have done it to ourselves? Wake up, I beg you! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, one thing we do know about climate is that it is a pretty odd old thing. We know that it was warmer on the globe in the Holocene period; we know it was warmer in the Roman period; we also know it was warmer in the medieval period. It was cooler in the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century. We also know there has been no significant change in climate over the last 6 000 years and we also know that most scientific organisations have confirmed that there has been no significant statistical global warming in the last 15 years? I have these figures in front of me. They are the same figures that Mr Davies quoted. He is very careful in what he selects. What I would like to suggest before everybody disappears to Durban, saving the world as they travel on first class airfares and sip their martinis in expensive hotels, is that I have old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week … and you are picking up the tab. I would suggest, given this fiscal crisis that we have, that it would be a nice gesture – particularly from you, Commissioner, who does not pay much income tax and is on a very good salary – for you to offer to pay for your own trip. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, it is a shame that the Commissioner has gone. He would learn so much from me, since, unlike most of the people here, I actually have commercial experience. I have actually run companies. I actually know what I am talking about. I am going to talk about jobs now. We have 40% youth unemployment in parts of the European Union, and it is being suggested by people here that this is some sort of act of God. It is not an act of God: it is sheer, unadulterated incompetence. Look at what the EU is doing. Look at the barriers it is putting in front of companies, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, preventing them from employing people. We have minimum wages. We have pensions. We have holiday entitlements. We have a job tax – called national insurance in my country – which is absolutely huge, so the employee does not actually get half the money that is being paid by the employer. Trying to get rid of lazy and incompetent workers is virtually impossible, so sacking people is very difficult. And if you cannot hire, you cannot fire, so you lose flexibility. We have maternity leave, paternity leave, stress leave and all the rest of the nonsense that is invented by people here who have absolutely no commercial experience at all. It is not an accident that we have 40% of our young people unemployed: it is your fault. And let me remind you of liberty of contract. In a free society, we should have liberty of contract so that an employer and an employee can get together, sign a contract and get on with their lives without interference from this place. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Madam President, Mr Sturdy is an eminent businessman very close to where I live. He is one of the few exceptions and I apologise to him. (Laughter) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I rise with some humility as representing a country which managed to elect a Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, a Scotsman, the only Scotsman in the world who actually does not care how much money he spends: it is an interesting phenomenon! So as I say, I rise with some humility. However, I look forward with the great British sense of humour which is one thing nobody can take away from us in this place which gave us an energy policy, an employment policy, a fisheries policy, an agricultural policy that have been – as almost everything that this place has done has been – a complete and total disaster. We are now contemplating a response to disasters, most of which of course we create for ourselves in this place. So I can say I look forward to seeing how this develops, how it goes forward in the future, and I am just interested to see what kind of pig’s breakfast you are going to make of this one! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I am a baby boomer. I was born just after the war. From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally. I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on – largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned. I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard. It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt. Let me explain, because I do not think you really understand. It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation – more money than they can possibly raise in taxation –, most of which, in point of fact, they actually waste. The reason we are talking about countries which are broke – and they are broke – is because their ridiculous, ineffective, ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise. Then they borrow, and they borrow, and – worse – they then print money, because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money. If you do that as a private citizen, it is a criminal offence. You would go to prison for that, yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time. Let me explain to you that these countries are broke. They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians. It is immoral – immoral! – to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks. They have defaulted. They are broke. For God’s sake, let us all admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Absolutely right. I was not suggesting my politicians were any less stupid than anybody else. It is an absolute disgrace, and there was not even a debate in our national parliament on actually rescuing these bust banks. If you want to invest in bust banks, do so with your own money, not money from my old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week, you scoundrels! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I rise before the House today to mention one or two things which might perhaps be of help. I spent 35 years as an investment banker, investment manager, investment adviser and economic strategist, and I never bought a dud bank in my life. I never bought a dud bank for my clients, but over the past few years, I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head, as a taxpayer, and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at. These are not even British dud banks, they are foreign dud banks, and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal. If I want to invest overseas, I will buy an emerging markets fund. I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force. I say ‘Mickey Mouse bank’, Mr Maystadt, because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life. I do not know where you get your advice from, but statistically, the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years, so what are you going to shovel all this money into? I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people. I would counsel you, if you want to keep your AAA status, to ignore the pleas of this House – full of eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives – in particular, in relation to paragraph 48 of the report. Solar panels in the land of the wildebeest, giraffe and bongo drum will lose you your AAA rating in no time at all. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, I would like to go back to the matter of Libya if I may. When did the political class and the great and the good suddenly catch up with the fact that Colonel Gaddafi is an evil man? When, since that wonderful photograph with you embracing him, Mr President, did you suddenly come to realise that he was a “wrong’un”? I can tell you that the victims of Lockerbie in Scotland and the victims of IRA atrocities in my country knew very well what sort of scoundrel this man was. But he has got oil and he has got money so you all turned a blind eye, didn’t you? Well, the chickens have come home to roost. The most absurd figure in all this is the British Prime Minister, who stands there rattling his empty scabbard – having disestablished the Royal Navy, having disestablished the Royal Air Force – making threats from the sidelines, with no aircraft carriers, nothing, and calls himself a Conservative but is just a superannuated schoolboy whistling in the dark. We talk a great deal about violence against the people, we talk a lot about democracy. And yet we have had a homicidal baboon in Zimbabwe for years now, and we do not do anything about it, do we? We do not care because there is no money and there is no oil. That is so typical of this place: full of hypocrisy and humbug. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have been here six and a half years, and, my goodness, I have heard some nonsense. But I have not heard so much nonsense spoken as I have today. Many years ago, I used to lecture on this subject at Cambridge University, and I would suggest that you would do well to read some of my old lecture notes. None of you, it appears, seems to understand the concept of international money. Herr Brok, who has not come off the phone since he came in only to listen to himself, was rather interesting. He started off this debate by suggesting it was a great success – the euro. One wonders what planet Herr Brok lives on. Dear oh dear! It is a complete disaster. If he thinks it is such a success, I would argue that he speak to the millions of unemployed people, youngsters mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the rest of Europe, who are suffering from this disgraceful, fraudulent and deceitful currency which was rammed down the throats of the people of Europe against their will. There is no mandate, Mr Duff. There is no mandate, with your blue card hanging up there, let me tell you. There is no mandate for this. The British people have not been given a vote on this whole shebang of European Union, and neither has anybody else. There is only one way this ridiculous currency spanning many different economies against a whole background of failed ideals can survive – and if you understood international money to any degree, you would understand this – and that is by having a financial, central, statist fiscal policy. If you think you have a mandate for that, you are a disgrace and a scoundrel. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I have to say to Mr Duff that at the time, in the mid-1990s, some of the class greeted my views with some scepticism. I still now go back to the occasional reunion dinner and most of them come up to me and say, ‘My god, Godders, you were right’. And I am, by god! I was right in spades, was I not? (Applause) Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, there is a lot of self-congratulation going on here in the European Union on International Women’s Day. It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog’s breakfast of it. You talk about maternity leave. All that is happening with draconian maternity leave, let me tell you, Madam, is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business. So you have done them no favours. We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court, which means that even if young women could get a job, they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled. And now you are talking about quotas. What kind of madness is this? Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business – professional women – are being patronised on quotas. Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say, are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business? The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this is simply not true and is not borne out by the statistics in my country. Speak to any small businessman you like in my country. I am not interested in the honourable Member’s country or other people’s countries, I am interested in my country and my economy, and I can tell you that all businessmen and women will say that they will not employ young women because of the draconian maternity laws. I wish, I desperately wish, you would come into the real world; hands up any of you who have had a real job! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Oviir, I would simply counsel her to let companies do their business. The less you regulate, the less you tax, the less you interfere, the quicker our economy will recover. That is what it is all about, and that is something the honourable Member does not understand. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Estrela, I can assure her that the problem with my country is that we have given up self-government and we are Members of the European Union: that is my country’s problem. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki, I would say that I believe that children are the responsibility of their parents and nobody else. I do not accept that somebody takes responsibility for his neighbour’s children. It is for the parents to take responsibility for their children and that is how it should be. The more self-responsibility we had in Europe – and indeed, the world – the better it would be, in my view. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– The views expressed by Herr Schulz meet the case. He is an undemocratic fascist. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, yet again there is one rule for Herr Schulz and one rule for everybody else. This is a disgrace. I have been elected – re-elected – to vote in this Chamber by the people of Yorkshire (your own constituency, I might add), with a democratic mandate which you yourself do not enjoy, Mr President, because you switched parties and they voted for the Conservatives. I have no intention of apologising, I have no intention of leaving this Chamber: you must have me escorted out, Sir! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, about five and a half years ago, I caused something of a furore by suggesting that any small businessman with his brain in the right place would be mad to employ a woman of childbearing age. Since then, it has got worse and worse as the balance in favour of employees versus employers has got completely out of control. One of my constituents from York wrote to me last year saying never mind about employing women of childbearing age, any small businessmen who employs anybody has got to be out of his mind. We have an extraordinary situation here, do we not? We have young women desperately keen to get into work, desperately keen to work for companies, especially small companies – which are the driving force of the United Kingdom economy – and we have employers who are too terrified to take them on. That is the problem we have. We are making it – here in this place with so little commercial experience amongst our Members – almost impossible for small businesses to employ young women, which is something they want to do. I used to think it was some sort of Chinese conspiracy where this place made it almost impossible for a European economy to function, and that behind the scenes the Chinese were making it so bad that eventually we had to import absolutely everything from China. Well, I have another hypothesis here, namely, that perhaps the women who are making it so difficult in committees, in the Commission and in this place for small businesses to employ young women have an eye to the main chance. I would suggest that when the electorate quite rightly look at them and boot them out in a few years’ time for their incompetence and their stupidity, they will only be able to get back into the workplace because they are in middle or late middle age. The game will be cleared for them. That is my hypothesis. I can think of no other sensible answer to this sort of ludicrous interference between employer and employee. If you think that is a weird hypothesis, anything that puts up with the way you talk about climate change, believe me, nothing is too stupid for this Chamber. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, when last I met the Commissioner, I expressed grave concern that regulation of the City of London was going to move to Brussels. He seemed surprised that I was so concerned, but since he has taken office, he might have come to understand that a significant portion of the United Kingdom’s GDP actually comes from its financial services sector. It is very important to the United Kingdom. Indeed, it picks up most of the tabs. The GBP 45 million a day we send to this place to support the rather suspicious European Union project, which has not given any of our electorate an actual say, is one of those tabs. In fact, you must understand that big salaries and big pensions do not grow on trees. Commissioner, I also mentioned to you that we could learn something from the old dominions – Australia, Canada – who have not suffered from this problem, and you rather charmingly, and in a very Gallic way, suggested that Australia was a long way away. I hope, now that you have been in office for a little while, you will understand that perhaps such a parochial approach will not do. I still worry, Commissioner. I still fret that we will have regulation from the usual mishmash of ignorant bureaucrats, parliamentary committees with their usual complement of cryptocommunists, anachronistic socialists, journeymen politicians, fringe greenies, a sprinkling of well-meaning housewives, and grandmothers exploring their new third age. The outcome will be the same as all the other EU projects: fishing, agriculture, energy, employment, immigration and, horror of horrors, the ticking time bomb of the single currency. It is an astonishing litany, is it not, of failure? You would think the European Union would get something right once by accident. I am sorry, but I am not satisfied. I am desperately cross that the British Conservative Party has given away the City of London regulation. If Dave Cameron had been the Admiral at Trafalgar, it would be Admiral Villeneuve on the plinth in Trafalgar Square now. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Commissioners – the three amigos if I may call you such – last session, Mr President, you had to scamper away. I think you had an urgent appointment. You missed my words of wisdom and I am glad to see that you are here to receive them today because I feel I have some wisdom to offer. You are in such a pickle actually, are you not? One could almost feel sorry for you but of course, you know, you bring some of this on yourselves. The common currency experiment – which is an experiment that was doomed to failure; I remember lecturing at Cambridge University back in the 1990s, explaining why it was deeply flawed and could not work and I gave it about 10 years and I am afraid it looks as though I was right – was flawed even by your own rule book. What in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book. You threw it away! You welcomed every fiscal dysfunctional economy into the eurozone, including Greece – which was going to hasten the demise of the eurozone, and it thus comes as no surprise. I am not a johnny-come-lately to the demise of the euro. It was always written in the runes, as it were. To suggest now that we have only just found out that Greece was broke is intellectually dishonest. I was in the City at the time and we were buying Greek bonds at 10% coupons, they fell to five and it was a one-way bet – a bit like having the winner of the horse before the race had even started! Our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy junk debt. They redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple A ratings. What are our central banks doing now? The very same thing. They are buying in the secondary market and buying junk bonds, repackaging them as triple A. This is just how we got into this pickle to start with. If you want to get out of this mess, you need to get rid of the political-establishment support for commercial banks and get rid of central banks, which are actually part of the problem, not the solution. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment. He who pays the piper calls the tune. It inevitably led to misgrading. Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet. They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all. Paradoxically, it is usually the hedge funds who find out the truth behind the numbers. They exposed Enron, for example. But the truth about numbers can be unpopular, especially here, which is why we hate them. However, even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke. Kaput
 is kaput
 in any language! So what does this House propose? Our own credit rating agency paid for by us, guaranteed to dance to our tune. It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone’s failed economies. The question is, who would these fool? I suggest, with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents, virtually nobody. When the people of Europe realise that they have been the guinea pigs in a gigantic failed currency experiment, they will burn this place down and guillotine the lot of us, and who could blame them? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Madam President, it is a shame that Mr Barroso has fled the Chamber. I feel he would have learned so much from me this evening! I would counsel you all not to worry too much about the EU in 2020 because I rather fancy it will not be here! It will go the same way as the Soviet Union which it so resembles, and for the same reasons: it is centralised; it is corrupt; it is undemocratic and it is incompetent; it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats; it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as ‘climate change’. Whenever the people of Europe get the chance of a referendum, they reject it. The British, of course, have not been given the chance to have their say, thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country, aided and abetted by an EU-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the BBC. The EU is already crumbling. The scenes in Greece today will spread through the other Mediterranean countries sooner than we can imagine, and they will eventually reach northern European countries, which are being left to pick up the tab. Our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I appear to have been living in some sort of parallel universe here, hearing about the success of the euro. Let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we? Unemployment, youth unemployment in the Iberian Peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic. It has been at 30-40% for years. Nothing to do with the crisis at all. A complete disaster. GDP per capita in the USA is miles ahead of the European Union. GDP in the Pacific Rim is miles ahead of the GDP in the Union. No, the euro has not been successful at all. It is already failing. It is already crumbling before our eyes. Just look at some economic basics. There is no lender of last resort, which is why we have this Greek crisis and a Portuguese crisis round the corner. There is no lender. This is impossible in global, in currency management, whether it is an optimal currency zone or not. There is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak. Let me just remind everybody here about something else if I may. There are two sorts of people: wealth creators, those people that go out and work in the private sector and create wealth, and there are the others who spend wealth, which are politicians and bureaucrats and there are too many of us. Far too many of us. We are the monkey on the economies’ back and, until these currency zones start cutting down public sector spending, it is going to get worse and worse and worse. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, a few weeks ago, my estimable friend and Yorkshire colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, brought the chairman of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to this assembly and presented him as a legend in his own lunchtime and a top climate science guru – and I have to say that he certainly looked like a guru to me – but it turns out that he is a railway engineer who writes mucky books. Now, I have nothing against railway engineers. Some of my best friends are railway engineers and no doubt they read mucky books – that is not the point – but it might explain perhaps, does it not, why the IPCC has come out with so much absurd nonsense in the last few years. Would it not be a good idea if the Commission, perhaps, were to write to the IPCC and suggest they get a new chairman, perhaps a tad better qualified? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, taxation as a concept has not really changed very much in the last 3 000 years, has it? The rich and the powerful stealing money from ordinary people to make their own lives more comfortable. Where there has been a change in modern times is that now taxation is ‘for the benefit of the taxed’: that somehow we are being taxed pro bono
. In order to perpetuate this myth, we invent periodic scares to frighten people into submission. The latest of these scares is of course that, if we do not cough up green taxes, we will all boil to death – reminiscent of the medieval religions, is it not, which played the same game: pay up or burn in hell. Tax harmonisation is a concept dreamed up by the modern political class to make sure that no government steals too little from its people: a sort of thieves’ cartel if you will. May I suggest, if you really want tax harmonisation, that the Commission and the bureaucracy pay the same taxes as the electorate, that they bear the same burden of tax as the rest of us, before the electorate storm this building and hang us from the rafters, as they have every right to do. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, you can, of course, tell that I am a sceptic because I do not dress like a scarecrow. I fought my way through the blizzard in Copenhagen, like many of you did. It is interesting, is it not, that we have had the coldest winter so far on record in London for 30 years? It is the same in Poland, Korea and China. We have had the coldest temperatures in Florida, Arizona, Texas – the first snow in Texas, I think, for a hundred years. Of course, as Giles Coren of the London Times
 said, my goodness me, we simply do not get it – of course that is what global warming is all about: we have got to get used to freezing temperatures. Well, we have seen the Al Gore hockey stick, which is still, I gather, being shown in London state schools – Al Gore, snake oil salesman, crook! We have seen Professor Jones from the University of East Anglia – crook! And now – you will not know about this yet because it has been kept out of the public domain – the New Zealand National Climate Database: I have the figures here – all fraudulent. When are you all going to wake up? Scam, scam, scam! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Climate, Mr Davies, is what we all have to put up with. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I rise very quickly and on a point of order. You said a few minutes ago that you were bound by the rules, and what can you do when you are bound by the rules? I fully understand that, and so does the House. Can I assume, and can we assume, that you will be bound by the rules of this House for your whole term of office? Because your predecessor felt he was not bound by the rules, and on the basis of explanations of vote he tore the rule book up because he did not feel bound by it. I leave it with you, sir. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I take this opportunity of wishing well the east European cities in the coming of the very early skiing season, with the snow and ice that have come there. Of course, this is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, and temperatures have been broadly flat since 1998. So we are all talking here about something which is not happening. Time and time again I have heard Members here talk of CO2
 as a pollutant. A pollutant! It is a life-giving natural gas. It gives me the impression that some of our Members have not had the benefit of a formal education. Isn’t this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people’s trouser pockets to steal yet more tax from them? Isn’t this all about political control? Isn’t this all about politics and big business? The whole thing is a sham – this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2
 is causing global warming. Enough please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy. Mike Nattrass  (NI
). - 
 Mr President, the influx of workers into the UK must be controlled by the UK Government. It is a simple matter of sovereignty. Britain already has a housing shortage. Hospitals and schools are not coping with the ever-growing immigrant population. Britain must protect its own citizens who have paid their taxes and built the country. The massive influx of immigrants produces an oversupply, adding to the unemployment problem, reducing job availability and reducing pay for working people. And yet, here we are facing yet more rules. These rules take control away from UK authorities, making management of the infrastructure impossible. Britain has not discriminated against foreign workers, and those willing to integrate with the existing population have been accepted, but now enough is enough. You say the free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom of EU citizens, a cornerstone of the internal market. I say a fundamental right of the UK is to roll away this stone and gain independence from Europe. We need our independence now. Sadly, a great British trade unionist and defender of working people, Bob Crow, died today. I wish the Left would embrace his views in this debate. Mike Nattrass  (NI
). - 
 Mr President, the Fourth Railway Package removes choice and dictates how to run a railway. Currently, Member States choose to directly award public service contracts or organise competitive tenders. This is yet another EU one-size-fits-all imposition inflicted on the UK, stopping any government from even considering alternatives to the current failed UK privatised model of railways.  So this EU package imposes: one, a dramatic cost escalation due to fragmentation; two, tax increases due to private train company subsidies; three, passengers facing the highest rail fares in Europe; four, minimal investment because profits are given to shareholders instead of reinvesting.  Directly-operated railways on the East Coast mainline prove that publicly owned and operated railways deliver increased performance, with much lower subsidy than private operators. UK governments must have the freedom to implement alternative models in line with the interests of passengers and of taxpayers. The UK Government must run its own affairs without EU interference in UK sovereignty. All the UK really needs is independence. Mike Nattrass  (EFD
). - 
  Mr President, here we have more legislation from the EU sausage machine to waste UK civil servants’ time and confuse citizens. I have listened to debates on the length of chickens’ beaks, inquiries into how much wine there is in a wine[nbsp ]gum and facts about rotten fruit leading to drunken reindeer which then savage people. The message-tapping CIA must be bored out of their tiny minds. You would serve your countries better by staying at home and chewing cardboard. There was a time when the British thought the Italians were amusing: ignoring the rules after making so many. We now understand that an over-supply of silly rules leads to disrespect for the law, and pedestrian crossings become suitable only for those with a suicidal tendency. We have far too much law. EU rules are openly broken and are not enforced by the Commission. This puts those who obey the rules into an adverse trading position. The failure to enforce EU law on the size of chicken cages, causing problems with egg production, is just one very costly example. Should you have further rules and mad-cap ideas up your sleeves, I suggest you shove them up your armholes or, like the Italians, make love not law. UKIP backs Westminster as the place where UK law must be made. For these reasons, UKIP will vote against this new law. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, you will be aware that many in the UK object – object – to the imposed EU citizenship and do not want it. They love Europe but they hate the EU because it is dictatorial and undemocratic. The following letter from constituent Alan Sheath illustrates this point. ‘Dear Mr Nattrass, on 7 February 1992, Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty. Unbeknown to myself and the vast majority of British subjects, every person in the UK, including Her Majesty The Queen, became a European citizen by ratification. Neither I nor 60 million other British subjects were consulted or asked to vote. I do not want this citizenship, so please advise me what measures there are in place to renounce it. I remain content with my British birthright’. I see from the papers on this debate that the EU is now forcing the UK to wreck its social security systems by opening the floodgates to Europe and the UK is being forced to abide by the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We do not want foreign legal frameworks, so when can the British people have a democratic vote please? Mike Nattrass  (NI
). - 
 Mr President, between 1958 and 1976, Iceland fought the cod wars with Britain. Now, cod stocks are rising because of Icelandic fish management. Compare that with the former UK fishing grounds, now in EU hands. Lost and ruined. The UK’s European dream turned into a nightmare. Established fishing communities die when the EU boats move in. My message to Iceland is obvious. If you join, you will lose your fish, your freedom and your currency and there is no regard for quotas or regulations in the EU. For the love of cod, do not do this. Say no. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Madam President, increasing the independence and powers of national bodies is good. The failings of the railway package are laughable, and the share of freight being moved by rail has actually fallen since the first railway package in 2001. Are the EU regulations enforced? The Commission will not enforce the regulations on battery cages for hens, which may well force producers who have complied out of business. So what is this about enforcement? Will cash-strapped national governments pay their fines? Some pay fines then continue to break the same rule, because the annual revenue collected exceeds the amount of the annual EU fine. The Commission has taken 13 Member States to the European Court of Justice for failing to correctly implement various parts of the railway package. Was anything enforced? Here, the EU sought control over national policy-making decisions on railways: for example, stopping the political will to run nationalised railways. These are matters of national sovereignty and the freedom of the voters – not the EU. The report criticises Member States for lack of investment to meet this package, but we are in the middle of an economic crisis. The legislation does not require clarification or improvement. It clearly should be scrapped. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President: So the EU seeks to raise EU revenue by taxation on trucks? Well, I ask UK voters what they think of the EU and the usual answer is ‘I do not think we should join’. The UK has been politically taken over. UK law is made in Strasbourg, a monster red-tape factory is closing industry, and now we have tax but, because it is not football, the people are not informed. The UK media avoid EU reality, brains are fed with TV soaps and reporters say the EU does not affect local issues. The EU is not news. This report seeks to raise tax from tolls on trucks, partly funding the trans-European TEN-T project, which includes linking high-speed EU trains. So, when the EU raises taxes in the UK, will the people respond by kicking the EU in the ballot box? No, because they are not informed. The final EU superstate takeover by stealth will be a taxpayers’ sleepwalk into Europe. The defences are down, the press do not care and the UK is asleep, so get those unfortunate truckers taxed. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, Mrs Kalniete wants to relaunch the Single Market and makes it sound like a V-2 rocket: extremely dangerous but never on target. Mr Correia de Campos is concerned about movement of workers. Well, so am I. The EU has swamped the United Kingdom with extra workers. The United Kingdom sees the world as the market. The straightjacket of the EU regulation is closing our industry, stopping innovation when it is ahead of the regulations and closing traditional industry, where the product is good but different from the approved continental version. Small business is the victim here. The United Kingdom is amongst those which do comply, yet it suffers because it does: for example, expensive compliance in the pig and egg industries with regulations that the Commission will not enforce, making our product uncompetitive. I have many more examples, but have been allocated just one minute to save small businesses. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, in view of what we have just been speaking about, I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us. I would like your reassurance that the investigation into Brussels security breaches, some involving firearms, is being vigorously pursued. These breaches have put our staff, our guests and ourselves at serious risk. May I also have your assurance that senior management will be held accountable where appropriate, and that these soldiers will not be sacrificed in order to protect the generals? (Applause) Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages, but it is about the ability of the EU to oversee the single market. States were given 10 years to comply by 1 January 2012 or the product would be illegal. The Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, British and others have complied, but certain large producers have simply refused. This involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money. The regulation has put about 15 pence on a dozen eggs. Those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage. Eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the EU. One producer borrowed GBP 10 million to comply with this directive. He did the right thing. Is the Commission going to renege and make his eggs uncompetitive? If more time is given, then the moral of this story is that, if the EU makes a directive, it pays to ignore it. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, the Commission proposed this directive in 2008 and there were concerns about placing excessive burdens on the scientific research industry. The proposal will dilute certain restrictions and I note that the requirement for sharing animal research data has been removed. Some 12 million animals are being used in experiments in the EU each year and this proposal could increase their suffering. We must reduce the need for experimentation on animals. Civilised human beings will try to strike a balance between the need for research and the obligation to respect the lives of other creatures on this planet. These decisions require the wisdom of Solomon. I regret, I have to say, I have to ask the question: does the EU Parliament have such wisdom? Mike Nattrass,

 Madam President, the British public are aggressively against whaling. If Britain’s hands are tied to one harmonised EU abstention on whaling, it will guarantee a return to slaughter. The inhumane Japanese are giving incentives to Third World countries to stop: and look at the return to whaling. It is murder. The Japanese Government should be regarded as socially unacceptable for doing this in a modern world. The British were once heavily involved but have consigned the mistake to a previous century. If the UK is stopped by the EU from voting against this, while the Japanese and others murder these beautiful, sensitive and intelligent mammals, the UK public will vote to leave the EU in uncontrollable anger. It will be the kiss of death for Britain’s membership of the EU. John Stuart Agnew, Marta Andreasen, Gerard Batten, John Bufton and Mike Nattrass  (EFD

 While we recognise that Cuba is a Communist tyranny and while we want to see Cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state, we do not recognise the EU in this process. Mike Nattrass,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom, the UK Government has implemented the EU rail package. This is mainly because, these days, the Lib-Lab-Con sit at Westminster and like to be told what to do, having given away control to the EU. The separation of train operators and separation of the rail network is leading to major problems, courtesy of the EU. No wonder 21 countries are too wise to get caught in an EU rail web leading to mayhem on all stations to Brussels. I am not a Socialist, but if you need an integrated transport system, then state ownership is best – and not separation into multiple private hands. Having six different companies on the network between Birmingham and Berlin will create a complete ‘dog’s breakfast’, or should I say a ‘Dachshunds Frühstück
’. When Eurorail is broken up to allow the surplus capacity to be run by different companies, we will no longer have rolling stock, just laughing stock. Brian Simpson, who is responsible for this debate, is a member of the Labour Party. Labour was once Socialist, and he was elected by people who still think Labour is Socialist. Yet here he is, hiding in the EU, away from his faithful supporters. What is he calling for? He is calling for privatisation. More than that; he is calling for an EU model which does not work and is against the wishes of his own voters. He is, in fact, the ‘Fat Controller’, creating fat pay packets for fat cats. The one thing that we can be sure of is that there is fat chance that this EU directive will be accepted, as it will derail the EU rail network. Mike Nattrass,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I come from the West Midlands, the home of the so-called ‘Tipton Taliban’, who were detained at Guantánamo. As a UKIP MEP, I must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another, without judicial oversight, and to face foreign imprisonment, is an alien process. It is an affront to liberty, democracy, accountability and natural human rights. I can give you a list of British citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way, into squalid and unfit jails, not at the hands of the CIA and its rendition programme, but at the hands of the EU Member States under the European arrest warrant which this House created. It was made in the EU. So, before you condemn the USA, look in the mirror and see your own hypocrisy.

– The UKIP admires volunteering and recognises the contribution to society it can make. However, this report called for the naked politicisation of volunteering for EU purposes, and for the use of the British taxpayers’ money to achieve this politicisation. Thus, we could not support the motion. John Stuart Agnew, Marta Andreasen, Gerard Batten, John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark, Trevor Colman, Nigel Farage, Mike Nattrass and Nicole Sinclaire  (EFD

– The UKIP is not opposed to cooperation in the field of energy efficiency, but insists that such cooperation must be conducted by democratically elected governments and not by their unaccountable proxies in an anti-democratic supranational organisation such as the EU. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, in his introduction President Barroso said that the First World War was an industrial war. Indeed, you have only got to drive two hours up the A4 motorway from here and visit the battlefield at Verdun to see exactly what he was talking about.  For those who have not visited, I think it is probably the grimmest battlefield on the Western Front or indeed anywhere in the world, and certainly the grimmest I have visited. It was something that had such a huge psychological effect on France that it very much dominated the thinking of Monnet and Schuman post-1945 – that this awful thing must never happen again. Those of us in politics will all remember that famous photograph of a quite large German Chancellor Kohl and a rather small French President Mitterrand holding hands, standing in front of the ossuary at Douaumont. The whole European project comes from the disaster that was sparked by the First World War. It is entirely understandable that people should have sought ways to prevent such awfulness. The difficulty is that they chose the wrong target. Monnet and Schuman decided – and this view is shared today by Mr Barroso, Mr[nbsp ]Cohn-Bendit and others – that it was the existence of the nation state that led to war and therefore we had to abolish the nation state. Actually, what we should have focused on, post-1945, was not the abolition of states, but making sure that the European states were democratic, because democratic nation states do not go to war with each other. So I have to say that I believe the whole European project is based on a falsehood. It is potentially a dangerous falsehood, because if you try to impose a new flag, a new anthem, president, army, police force, foreign policy – and whatever else – without first seeking the consent of the people, you are in danger actually of creating the very nationalisms and resentments that you sought to snuff out in the first place. We have done all this before. We did it after the First World War in the Balkans. We said that we could not have all these little Balkan states going around fighting with each other. We said that we should bring them together and give them one flag, one anthem and one president and call it Yugoslavia. It led to horrific wars from 1990 and the deaths of tens of thousands of people, as they fought to get out of a false state.  The European Union is making a very similar mistake, because there is no consent for this project. I have heard people this morning talking about the need for a United States of Europe on a federal model. You can only have that if people give consent for it, and nobody has done so. When the EU put the constitution to the peoples of Europe – the first time it really came clean with the electors – they rejected it.  I am not against Europe, but I am against this Europe. I want a Europe of independent, sovereign nation states that trade together, work together and cooperate together. I believe the European elections this year will mark a turning point. The tide is turning. The EU is backing an outdated model that seeks to get rid of a problem that actually has not existed since 1945. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, even by the standards of this place, today’s atmosphere has been leaden. A great global political leader, Mr Barroso, comes along and out of 750 Members, 44 people turn up to listen. Why is that? Well, I have noticed something: I have been here fifteen years, but in the last five years something really big has changed. The European dream is crumbling, absolutely crumbling. There are a few maniacs in the front row here and in your Commission who of course still want a United States of Europe, but actually out there in the Member States they do not. And most of the MEPs here, yes, they want a job, yes, they want to be re-elected, but the enthusiasm for this project is dying. Why? Well you have made two big mistakes. The first mistake was of course to extend the eurozone. It would have been OK had it just been Germany and a few northern European countries, but to bring the Mediterranean into the eurozone has been a disaster. The second mistake was to allow the free movement of people to southern and to Eastern Europe. We in the United Kingdom – who have been the most open country with regard to immigration of any European country through a history that has lasted hundreds of years – now have 4[nbsp ]000 migrants a week who come to Britain from the European Union and stay for a year or more. These are the two realities that have hit home to people: the EU does not work economically, and open-door migration is fundamentally changing societies in ways that people do not want. Listen to the economics. Mr Barroso, you talked today about the possibility of an industrial renaissance in Europe, which sounded good. Lighter-touch regulation – all very encouraging. And then you say: but we must pursue our climate-change carbon targets. The Americans have gone for shale gas and reduced energy prices. The Chinese are digging up coal in quantities we cannot fathom and building two coal-fired power stations every week. This policy of economic unilateralism on climate change is what is destroying jobs in Europe, and the electors are going to have a chance in 72 days’ time to give their verdict. I suspect the next European Parliament will be very much more exciting than this one has been this morning. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Had there been a proper question there, I might try to answer it. Euroscepticism is growing right across the European Union. Nobody here, not even the maniacs that believe in the project, would question that. It is coming in all shapes and forms. It is on the right, it is in the centre, and it is on the left. The reason is of course – and you come from Ireland, so you should know better than anybody – that actually no one has ever given consent for a political European Union. The French clearly – followed by the Dutch – rejected the Constitution. They rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty, and only one country had a referendum on that. That was Ireland, and the people of Ireland rejected it. So you cannot tell me that there is popular support for a United States of Europe. Mrs Reding may believe it, Mr Barroso may believe it, one or two in the front row may believe it, but the peoples of Europe do not believe it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I have sat here this morning feeling like the odd man out. To me it is beyond parody for the Greek Finance Minister, Mr Kourkoulas, to come along here and tell us our fortune: the policies are bearing fruit, we are going to tackle unemployment. And no-one says anything! No, because, of course, everybody here is tied up with the same obsession that the euro must and will work; the obsession that you will use the crisis to build a United States of Europe. What you could have told them, Mr[nbsp ]Kourkoulas, is that, according to the respected medical journal The Lancet
, there are now 800[nbsp ]000 people in Greece without access to welfare or medical care. You could have told them that. But even if you had, they would not have listened, so obsessed are they with building the euro. OK, a simple lesson in economics: when you have two countries that are at completely different stages of the economic cycle, one currency needs to devalue. But if those countries are pegged or tied inside the same currency and they cannot devalue, you have to devalue the country – and that is what is happening to the Mediterranean. We are devaluing the Mediterranean, and it is leaning towards Third World status. No amount of socialist state spending can mend this imbalance. It is about time, if people here cared for the citizens of Europe, particularly in the south, that we admitted the euro does not work for southern Europe and it is time we broke it up and gave countries currencies that reflect their current economic status.

 The point that the late Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, made is that it is tough enough to have an interest rate that works for Newcastle and London, let alone to have one that works across the whole of Europe, so there is a valid economic argument.  However, the taxpayers in London do not object strongly to transfers going to Newcastle or Scotland or wherever they may be needed because we are part of the same country. The problem you have with the euro area is not just this huge economic imbalance between north and south, but that increasingly the taxpayers of the north do not want to go on subsidising the south because there is no sense of European identity. We are very different countries. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I must congratulate you, Mr Samaras, for getting the Greek Presidency off to such a cracking start. I am sure your overnight successful negotiations in the trialogue on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) will have them dancing in the streets of Athens. No matter that your country, very poorly advised by Goldman Sachs, joined a currency which it was never suited to; no matter that 30 % are unemployed, that 60 % of young people are unemployed, that a neo-Nazi party is on the march, that there was a terrorist attack on the German embassy. No, do not worry about all that, because the trialogue on MiFID has been a success, and in many ways it sums up the two Europes: the Europe that is talked about in here by the dreamers, who want to impose a united states of Europe with an identity and currency, and the real world out there. And you come here, Mr Samaras, and tell us that you represent the sovereign will of the Greek people? Well, I am sorry, but you are not in charge of Greece, and I suggest you rename and rebrand your party. It is called New Democracy. I suggest you call it No Democracy, because Greece is now under foreign control. You cannot make any decisions, you have been bailed out and you have surrendered. Democracy: the thing your country invented in the first place, and you cannot admit that joining the euro was a mistake, because of course Mr Papandreou did that, didn’t he? He even said there should be a referendum in Greece – and within 48 hours the unholy trinity that now run this European Union had him removed and replaced by an ex-Goldman Sachs employee puppet. We are run now by big business, big banks and, in the shape of Mr Barroso, big bureaucrats, and that is what these European elections are really going to be all about. It is going to be a battle of national democracy versus EU state democracy. Whatever you may say in this Chamber, the people out there do not want a united states of Europe, they want a Europe of sovereign states trading and working together, and I believe the European elections are going to mark a watershed. Until now everybody has thought – much as they may not like the development of the European Union – that it was inevitable. That myth of inevitability will be shattered by the European elections this year. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, I know it is seasonal to talk about the 12 days of Christmas, but I want to talk about the 21-day count down to the opening of the doors to 29 million poor people from Romania and Bulgaria. It does, I think, mark a pivotal moment in British politics. Very often in Britain, MEPs complain that they do not have a high enough profile with the public. I want to try and change that today because Brigadier Geoffrey Van Orden sitting behind me here, British Conservative, was the rapporteur, the sponsor for Bulgaria joining the European Union and for us having a total open door to all of those people. So well done, Brigadier, I want all the British people to know who you are and what your achievements are and of course what free movement means – it means free health care; it means free education; it means free access to the benefit system; it means an open door to the criminal gangs and the modern day Fagins who will of course benefit from the fact that London is the most successful and wealthy international city in Europe. Already the situation is so bad that 92% of ATM crime in London last year was committed by Romanians. I am not scapegoating in any way and I know that a lot of people that come from Bulgaria and Romania will be very decent people who want to work hard and want to better their lives, but free movement does not work in the European Union now that we have countries that are poor. For a man that comes from Bucharest and works in London and gets child benefit for the two children back home: that child benefit is worth more than he can actually earn doing a menial job in Bucharest and that is the reason why the numbers that come to Britain will indeed be absolutely enormous. I have said for some time, and now the British people agree, enough is enough. 80% of the British people do not want those borders to come down in 21 days’ time. It is unfair. It is unfair on working people. It is leading to lower wages. It is leading to higher youth unemployment and it is leading to divided communities. But of course it does not end here, because our Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, with the full support of Labour and the Lib Dems, now wants to extend this principle of open borders, as he says himself, from the Atlantic to the Urals. So it means countries like Kazakhstan, indeed the Ukraine, joining the European Union. I see that Tony Blair is now helping Albania join the European Union. Well good luck to them with that. We even want to extend it to Turkey joining the European Union. Our message is that a turkey is just for Christmas; it is not for political union; we do not want open borders. And, Mr Cameron, do not, next week at the summit, surrender in any way to deeper European military integration. Many in this room would have bombed Syria had Europe had that capability. Thank God it did not. On open doors, on European armies, the voters will have their say next May, and I think there is going to be a radical change. I think there is going to be an earthquake in British politics next May. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr Brons, thank you for the question. Can I make something clear to you? UKIP is not against immigration. We welcome immigration. We want immigration; but we want an immigration system based, as the Australian one is, on saying we want people who have got skills to bring to our country. We do not want people who have got life-threatening diseases. We do not want people who have got criminal records – though of course in Australia, in the old days, that was a prerequisite – and we want to make our own decisions on who comes to Britain. We are not discriminatory, we are not scapegoating, we just want to control our own borders and live in our own democracy and we cannot do that as members of this European Union. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, there is only one real debate going on here this week in Strasbourg: it is the fear stalking the corridors, the concern you have got about the rise of euro-scepticism. Years ago you were less worried. The few of us here who were euro-sceptics were treated as being mentally ill and sort of patted on the head. Now we are evil populists; we are dangerous; we are going to bring down western civilisation. It is clear that you do not get it, you do not understand why this is happening. Well, let me help you. In 2005 it was the pivotal moment of this project: the French and the Dutch had said ‘No’ to the EU Constitution. Mr Barroso stood up and said: ‘They did not really vote ‘No’. They did not understand what they were doing’. But they did. You see, ever since 2005, the real European debate has been about identity. What we are saying – large numbers of us – from every single EU Member State is: ‘We do not want that flag. We do not want the anthem that you all stood so ramrod straight for yesterday. We do not want EU passports. We do not want political union’. If you think about it, there is nothing extreme about that position. There is nothing right-wing about that position; there is nothing left-wing, indeed, about that position. It is a normal, sensible assertion of identity. What we are saying on our side of the argument – you see, you can scream and shout all you like, which really rather proves to me why you are going to do so badly in the European elections next year, because you are not listening – we want to live and work and breathe in a Europe of nation-state democracy. We want to trade together, we want to cooperate together. We are happy to agree sensible common minimum standards and, yes, we want to control our own borders, which is the rational, logical and sensible thing for any nation state to do. We are not against immigration or immigrants. We believe there needs to be a degree of control, and that is the message that is picking up support right across this continent. I genuinely think that there is an opportunity for an electoral earthquake to happen in the European elections next year, with a large number of people from all sides of this House who will come with a nation state agenda, who will come saying: ‘Let us have a Europe, as de Gaulle might have said, of the patries
; let us not have a Europe of political union’. You can abuse us all you like, but what we stand for is fair, principled and democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, not one in a thousand British people would know who Commissioner Andor was. They would not be able to pick him out of a line-up and yet he is really rather powerful. He is the governor. He is the man who decides who can come to Britain and who can claim benefits. He has more power than a British Government Minister. But I have to thank him for his study, because he is the one who has told us that there are 600 000 economically-inactive Eastern Europeans in Britain – something our own government was not able to tell us. I suppose I have to admire his commitment to his job. After all he is going to take the UK Government to court to make sure that we do not treat Eastern Europeans any differently to our own people. So it is certain that he means business. I know that this is a very complex area, but let us just look at one in-work social benefit, shall we? Child benefit. From Eastern Europe, at the moment, there are people to whom we are now paying child benefit for 50 000 children who do not even live in the United Kingdom. There is no possible justification for us doing that. It is costing us GBP 1 million a week, and it is yet another pull factor. But of course, this whole issue is going to get bigger, because we appear to have learnt nothing from 2004. If you allow the unrestricted free flow of people between poor and rich countries, do not be surprised when you get a big result. We had a government prediction of 13 000 people a year, and it was something like 400 000 a year for the first two years. So we open the doors next year to Romania and Bulgaria. It means more oversupply in the unskilled labour market, a greater burden on the National Health Service and our schools and, yes – sadly – it is going to mean more crime too. This issue will be the central issue of the European elections next year. It will be the central issue of whether Britain remains a member of the European Union. We are not against anybody from Eastern Europe, but we do believe that it is right and proper that we should restrict and decide who comes to live in our country. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the problem is not just Mr Barroso but the entire unelected government of Europe – and perhaps there is a chance for our citizens to reflect on where the real power lies in this Union. I have listened to Mr Barroso for nearly 10 years and I give him full marks for consistency. He is a man who likes fixed ideology. He probably picked it up when he was a Communist or a Maoist, or whatever he was, and for the last 10 years he has pursued Euro-federalism combined with an increasing green obsession. And yes, it has been good! For bureaucrats, big businessmen and landowners it has not been a bad decade, but it has been a disaster for poor people, unemployed people and those on low wages. The euro, which you, Mr Barroso, believed would give us monetary stability, has done the very opposite. It was a misconstruction from the start and it is pretty clear that youth unemployment, at nearly 50% across the Mediterranean, is probably nearly double what it would have been, as a direct result of the misconstruction that is the euro. The countries in question are in the wrong currency, but I know that you will never admit to that. I think the euro will die a slow and painful death, but you are all in denial about that. However, it is the green agenda that I really find more interesting. You keep telling us, Mr Barroso, that climate change is an absolute top priority and you have been greeted with near-hysteria in this place over the last 10 years. Those of us who have been sceptical have been mocked, derided and called deniers. We argued from the start that the science was not settled, and we have argued very strongly that the measures we are taking to combat what may or not be a problem are damaging our citizens. We have been proved to be right. Tens of millions have been forced into fuel poverty; manufacturing industry is being driven away because our competitors in China and America are going for cheap fossil alternatives; and wind turbines are blighting the landscapes and seascapes of Europe. Yet still today you go on about green growth. Well, the consensus is breaking down behind you. Commissioner Tajani said the other day that we face a systematic industrial massacre. It is time to stop this stupidity. To help you, there is the NASA photograph taken last August of the northern ice caps and there is the NASA photograph of the ice caps taken this year. The ice has increased by 60% in one year. Leading American scientists are now saying that we are going into a period of between 15 and 30 years of global cooling. We may have made one of the biggest and most stupid collective mistakes in history by getting so worried about global warming. You can reverse this in the next seven or eight months. You can bring down people’s taxes. If you do not do so, they will vote on it in the European elections of next year.

 Oh no, I’m sorry, old son, I haven’t accused you of not working – far from that. I have accused you of doing far too much and actually, collectively in this House, forming a consensus, and I am going to come back to this green agenda. You all formed the view that carbon dioxide emissions were leading to rapid global warming and that it was the greatest crisis that has ever faced mankind, and therefore we had to start taxing carbon. There has been no global warming, Sir, for twenty years. The ice caps have grown significantly over the last twelve months, and I am making a positive proposal that would put back into work tens of thousands of people, and I am saying: let us scrap these climate levies and let us see where the science goes over the course of the next few years. I cannot think of a more positive thing that has been said in this House this morning. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, next year’s European election will not be contested on the old division lines of left and right and several group leaders have agreed with that today. Frankly, that is all irrelevant. It will be contested between those of us that believe in national democracy within the nation state and those that believe that the 28 countries that are part of the EU are better governed by these institutions. That in a sense is what this comes down to.  But, Mr Barroso, those of us that believe in national democracy do not want to take us back to the Western Front or 1914. Those of us that believe in national democracy will say to you it is a healthy assertion of identity, but it also shows a deeper understanding of why the problems of Europe were caused in the past. It is democratic nation states in Europe, that are stable, that will not go to war with each other, which are a force for good and I would remind people that, without the vote in the House of Commons two weeks ago, we would now be at war in Syria. What better proof can there be that nation state democracy can be a force for good? Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, I represent a group which is against military action in Syria. We are against it not because we are pacifists; we are against it not because we do not care about the awful things going on there. We are against it because we think there is some pretty poor thinking going on. The idea that somehow the rebels are the good guys and Assad’s regime are the bad guys really is an over-simplification of a situation in which we know that al-Qa’ida has significant representation amongst the rebel groups. Of course, we have seen it all before: an endless series of military adventures over the course of the last 10 to 15 years. One such, in Afghanistan, is still going on and is not achieving any of the original aims. I was worried when I heard the Americans telling us, to begin with, that it was about punishing Assad and then, within a week, that it was about regime change – a position which I know the noble Baroness herself supports. We think that firing a thousand cruise missiles is likely to make an unstable situation even worse than it is now. In a sense, Baroness Ashton, you are sitting pretty because, as the highest-paid female politician in the world, luckily you have a non-job because the EU, thank goodness, has not yet got a foreign policy and, as a result of that, what we saw two weeks ago in the UK House of Commons was a nation-state democracy standing up and saying something. As a direct result of that vote in the House of Commons, we have not gone to war in Syria: we have entered a period of negotiations and Assad has a chance to prove to all of us whether he is a good man or a bad man. I do not know how this will play out but at least, Mr Verhofstadt, there is a chance of peace, and I know that you represent the kind of political class who believe that global influence can be achieved only through bombing. Well, luckily – unlike extreme EU nationalists like yourself – British democracy has proved that nation-state parliaments can actually made people rethink. And, Mr President, I have to say, as somebody who has been here now for 14 years, it is ironic that the view which I used to represent was called extreme, but you can see who are the extreme militarists now.

The ‘good guys versus bad guys’ story is really something I take from your own Foreign Secretary and party member William Hague, who was urging the international community to arm the rebels – which struck me, given that we know of al-Qa’ida’s involvement, as total and utter madness. I will remain cynical and sceptical, like much of the European public, about who has used those weapons until we get the full report and we get the intelligence right. We went to war in Iraq being told that Saddam had weapons of … (Interjection to Mr Verhofstadt, who had been shouting objections: ‘Why don’t you shut up and listen for a change? You really must be the vilest, rudest man in European politics and you rant on and the Chair lets you get away with it because you are the former Prime Minister of Belgium. Well, there we are.’)
 So, Mr Tannock, I understand what you are saying. I understand that something ghastly has happened here, but before you take military action you need to be certain you are going to make things better and not worse.

 Sir, I would say this to you. I have never described the Romanians as living like pigs. What I said was that the Romanians treat their Roma minority like pigs. All right? So let us get that absolutely clear. You and your country discriminate against a large group of people in a way we have not seen in Europe since the 1930s. All right? Now, look. I am not taking sides in this civil war. But I am saying this: that whether it is through the use of gas, or whether it is through the use of other forms of high explosives or bullets, there are terrible things happening in Syria – I understand that and I agree – but rushing to war as we did in Afghanistan, as we did in Iraq, was a mistake and Mr Cameron tried to bounce us into war and, thank goodness, the House of Commons has given us pause for thought. Surely that must be a good thing. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, for the first time this year not just Mr Barroso but also President Van Rompuy have come to the Chamber, and yet look around you. What have we got? Five percent turnout amongst Members? They have not missed much. Just the usual drivel about the fight against youth unemployment.  With 62% youth unemployment in Greece, and with Spain not far behind, it is perhaps about time we were honest and admitted we are causing it ourselves. We are doing it through the misconstruction of the euro, through the obsession with global warming and the over-regulated business model. Yet your recipe is more bureaucracy: a youth guarantee scheme, another six billion for the youth employment initiative, the setting-up of the European alliance for apprenticeships, backed up by the quality framework for traineeships, and the list goes on, and on: yet more highly-paid civil servants setting up organisations that will achieve nothing.  Until the euro is broken up, until you reverse the social market model you will not help youth unemployment. However I must concede you have had one great victory. A couple of years ago Mr Barroso said that the European Union was an empire, and your empire has just expanded. Indeed David Cameron appears to be the biggest cheerleader for the EU extending all the way to the Urals. No, you have got Croatia. You have planted your flag on Croatian soil. Not that there was much public support for this: only 22% of Croatians turned out to vote in the European Parliament elections. But there was plenty of support from the Croatian political class.  Oh yes, the Prime Minister who negotiated entry, Mr Sanader, who was jailed for ten years last year for selling national assets, has been backed up by the whole of Croatia. They have sold out their country for personal gain and to be on a bigger stage. A country that fought for 800 years to be independent has given it away after twenty years to these guys in front of us today. Well you may be getting away with it for the moment, but it is not going to last very long. There is a gathering electoral storm. It is coming on the left, in the centre and on the right. You can hardly fail to notice what has happened in big countries like France or Italy, what is happening in Finland, the Netherlands, and even in Britain. The European elections next year present the opportunity for us to show you, Mr Barroso, that the European project is reversible, and it needs to be reversed for the betterment of the peoples of Europe.

 Well there was a referendum in theory. You will notice that less than 50% of people turned out to vote; you will notice that millions of euros from the European institutions were poured for many years into Croatia; and you will notice that there was something called pre-accession aid – we can call it bribery if you like – that was poured into Croatia, and there was a prize.  We, in turn, offered a prize for the first Eurosceptic article that appeared in a Croatian newspaper. In the three years leading up to the referendum we did not have to give away any money. That is the point: it is a one-sided political debate and it is all about the power of Brussels and the greed and vanity of politicians in Member States.  I am paid by the European Parliament and what I am doing – just as the Scottish National Party do, and just as the Irish Nationalists in the 19th century did – is using that money to expose the waste, the fraud and the extent to which our countries are now governed by these Chambers. The sooner I get the opportunity, Sir, to be the turkey that votes for Christmas, I will do so! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, well, there is a great degree of unity here this morning. A common enemy: rich people and successful companies evading tax, which is of course a problem – avoiding tax, which is not illegal but gives this whole Chamber this morning a high moral tone and, as Mr Barroso says, it is all about the perception of fairness. There is the added bonus, of course, that it drives a wedge between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans. But before we declare our virtues, perhaps we ought to look just a little bit closer to home, and I hope that the taxpayers all over Europe listen to this. If we look at the officials that work for the Commission and for Parliament, the highest category are people that earn a net take-home pay of just over GBP 100 000 a year and yet, under EU rules, they pay tax of 12%. It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, and I would say to Mr Barroso: how can that be deemed to be fair? How can people out there struggling – the 16 million unemployed in the eurozone – look at these institutions not only paying people vast sums of money but allowing them tax and, also of course, pension benefits on a scale not seen anywhere else in the world? So I suggest we have a bit less of this high moral tone. And what have these officials given us? Well they were the architects of the euro, which is a complete disaster. Their obsession with global warming, which chimes very strongly here, means we are despoiling our landscapes and seascapes with these disgusting wind turbines and driving up energy prices. But never let it be said that I cannot acknowledge success when I see it, and I am sure the citizens of Europe will all clap and cheer loudly that the grave mortal danger of olive oil in dipping bowls has been removed by the officials. Well done, everybody! (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

I agree with you that tax evasion is a problem and is costing governments money, but we should remember that tax avoidance is legal. The biggest reason that tax havens are allowed to prosper is that we have got this very statist mindset that we must try to get as much tax out of successful individuals as we possibly can. If you do that, and if you have a very complicated tax system, people will do all they can within the law to avoid paying tax. The answer for Western governments is to learn some of the lessons from the 1980s in Britain and America: bring taxes down, simplify taxes, and then those who wish to obey the law have no need to use tax havens.

Madam President, 25 years ago Mrs Thatcher recognised the truth behind the European project. She saw that it was about taking away democracy from nation states and handing that power to largely unaccountable people. Knowing as she did that the euro would not work, she saw that this was a very dangerous design. We in UKIP take that same view, and I have tried over the years in this Parliament to predict what the next moves would be as the euro disaster unfolded. But, even in my most pessimistic speeches, I would never have imagined, Mr Rehn, that you and those in the Troika would resort to the level of common criminals and steal money from people’s bank accounts in order to keep propped up this total failure that is the euro. You even tried to take money away from the small investors, in direct breach of the promise you made back in 2008.  The precedent has been set, and if we look at countries like Spain, where business bankruptcies are up 45 % year on year, we can see what your plan is to deal with the other bail-outs as they come. I must say, the message this sends out to investors is very loud and clear: get your money out of the eurozone before they come for you.  What you have done in Cyprus has actually sounded the death knell of the euro. Nobody in the international community will have confidence in leaving their money there. And how ironic to see the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, say of your actions: ‘I can only compare it to some of the decisions taken by Soviet authorities.’ And then we have a new German proposal that says that actually what we ought to do is confiscate some of the value of people’s properties in the Southern Mediterranean eurozone States. This European Union is the new communism: it is power without limits. It is creating a tide of human misery, and the sooner it is swept away the better.  And what of this place? What of the Parliament? This Parliament has the ability to hold the Commission to account. I have put down a motion of censure debate on the table. I wonder whether any of you have the courage to recognise it and to support it? I very much doubt that. I am minded that there is a new Mrs Thatcher in Europe, and he is called Frits Bolkestein. He has said of this Parliament – remember, he is a former Commissioner – that it is not representative of Dutch or European citizens any more, and is ‘living out a federal fantasy which is no longer sustainable’. How right he is! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the air is thick with denial in this Chamber this morning. There has been a major political event that has happened since we last met and no one has mentioned it: Italy had an election. 55 % of the electorate voted for euro-sceptic political parties. Indeed, Mr Grillo’s movement managed to get 26 %. It is quite tough in European politics these days to tell who the comedians are.  What is absolutely clear is that eurozone membership is completely incompatible with nation state democracy. You can do what you like to take away the powers of national parliaments but people will go on voting, and there is a trend developing right across Europe towards euro-sceptic parties getting and stronger.  There is complete denial about the eurozone crisis. You would think listening to everybody this morning that it is over. Mr Barroso comes out with a technocratic speech that everything is fine and dandy. Mind you, this was far better than the unutterable drivel we had from Olli Rehn yesterday, which sent many Members to sleep. But the EU is not facing up to the consequences of what it has done. Mr Verhofstadt talks about a lost generation in Spain; Mr Daul talks about youngsters struggling to be fed by their families in Greece. All of that is true, but it is being caused by the euro – and that is what the EU is failing to recognise.  The eurozone has been a complete economic disaster. But the real problem that the EU will not face up to though is the state of the French economy and the fact that France is now diverging by the month from Germany. So right at the very heart of the European project and the eurozone project there is a disaster coming down the track. I am afraid that, in the end, the whole thing is going to break up.  I would also point out that you are in denial over Romania and Bulgaria. Those countries are wracked with corruption and organised crime. They should never have been allowed to join the European Union and I want to make it absolutely clear: we in UKIP do not believe it is right and fair to have total open borders from next year for unlimited numbers of people from those countries to come to Britain to work but also, if they want, to claim benefits. As the results in the recent Eastleigh by-election showed, the British electorate are increasingly saying that enough is enough. It is not just us: the Mayor of Duisberg in Germany has now publicly said that the massive influx from Romania and Bulgaria is causing huge social problems. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to face up to it. We should not be in political union with Romania and Bulgaria. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Let me give you
 some figures. They are not ones that I really feel comfortable talking about as they are so shocking. There are 68 000 Romanians living in Britain. Over the course of the last five years in just one police area, the Metropolitan Police, there have been – believe it or not – 27 000 arrests of Romanians. Over 90 % of ATM fraud that takes place in London is now being committed by Romanian criminal gangs, and that is just the Met figures. We have not got the figures from across the rest of the country. Whilst with immigration you can get good people coming from other countries, you can also get bad people. The point I made in my speech is that I am afraid that Romania and Bulgaria are in the grip of organised crime. We do not want those people coming into our country. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, the highlight today of this debate was the Liberal leader, Mr Verhofstadt, comparing the seven-year EU economic plan with the Soviet Union’s five-year economic plan – and it was said without any sense of irony at all, which I thought was delicious.  Well, as the leaders meet tomorrow to discuss this budget, what a curious position David Cameron finds himself in. He made the big speech; he talked about a referendum in the future, and yet he has been criticised at home for making us wait for perhaps up to five years before we can have our say. Most people doubt his Eurosceptic sincerity, indeed he emphasised in that speech how pro-European Union he is, and yet here today he is met with a sort of venomous attack as if he is some terrible wrecker. I would have thought his chances of renegotiating very much look pretty limited, so I feel a bit sorry for him. He is like piggy in the middle, and you all remember from childhood what a frustrating and difficult place that is to be.  But he has made the speech, and we are going to have a proper debate in Britain about EU membership; but it is a debate that is changing. You see, the budget is not our top line issue. We pay in GBP 53 million a day. Whether that goes up to GBP 60 million or not, many of us are saying: why pay in a penny piece? Mr Barroso’s idea that a pound or a euro spent at European level is worth more than a pound or euro spent at national level – well, perhaps he has invented nuclear money, I have no idea. What perhaps we should recognise is that unemployment is actually being caused by Europe’s policies, in particular the mistaken euro project. The debate in Britain has changed and now it is about immigration. People in Britain are shocked at the change in every single city and market town since we opened the doors to eastern Europe in 2004. I have nothing against Bulgarians or Romanians, but it is unacceptable that we should open our doors to them unconditionally from 1 January next year. If Mr Cameron does not get a substantial renegotiation on the free movement of peoples then Britain will leave this Union. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, despite his own views, President Hollande is are doing rather a lot for the eurosceptic debate in France. President Hollande, the decision to reduce the retirement age, to increase the minimum wage and above all, of course, to introduce the ‘hate tax’ to make sure that all of your successful entrepreneurs – and now footballers – flee France, these all mean that the competitiveness gap between France and Germany is getting wider. That is now being reflected in a flight of capital from French banks. And people are beginning to notice that, ultimately, the euro is not just doomed in the Mediterranean, but it is going to be impossible for France and Germany to stay together inside the same economic and monetary union.  So, when your Employment Minister says the country is bankrupt, what do you do? The old trick of launching a foreign military intervention. Your troops go off to Mali; and yes, it is very good to see the smiling faces in Timbuktu for the moment, but you have done this on behalf of the European Union. It is now an EU mission. Just two days ago, Tony Blair said that the European Union is not about peace, but about power. I think what he meant is the European Union increasingly will be about war because the response to Mali, the response to it being an EU mission – and we have heard it all around the the Chamber today, the Liberals urging us to intervene militarily in Syria, support from right and left in this House – is that the EU should intervene militarily.  I have to say this: if you really think that taking on fundamentalist radical Islam in battle is something that we can somehow succeed in, I suspect we will launch ourselves in the same way we have in Afghanistan on a decade of unending, unwinnable misery. I do not want the United Kingdom to be part of a militaristic, warlike European Union, and that is the speech that I have heard both from you, President Hollande, and from most people in this Chamber today. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, we see there is nothing to worry about! Mr Barroso told us last week – I think I can say – that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome. Nothing to see here; move along – crisis over. Mr Draghi and Angela Merkel may well have committed the German taxpayer to unlimited sums of money in order to prop up the eurozone, and certainly ahead of the German elections there is perhaps not much else she could have done – and I do accept that the pressure from the markets, Mr Barroso, has eased for now. And from your perspective, Mr Barroso, and from everybody’s perspective I suppose, the champagne is still flowing, the chauffeur-driven cars are shiny, the salaries and of course the expenses are attractive, so everything is rosy in the EU garden. But I do not think we should be kidding anybody, Mr Barroso, because the fundamentals have not changed. In fact things deteriorated in 2012 – substantially. Unemployment has soared, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, with youth unemployment now up to 58% in two of those countries. Manufacturing, both in the north and south of the eurozone, is eroding with every single month that goes by, and there are the levels of human suffering that we are seeing – with pensions having been cut back, with soup kitchens growing all over the place, and with people in despair – and the prospects for 2013, particularly for the Mediterranean, are that it will be worse still.  And yet what the Commission and you, Mr Barroso, from your ivory tower, are saying is ‘let them eat cake’. You are showing that the European political class are out of touch, uncaring and simply plain wrong. But I am pleased to say that in Britain there is a proper European debate that is starting, driven I suspect by the rise of UKIP in the polls, and Mr Cameron, having postponed it for a few times, will speak this Friday on the issue. He wants to renegotiate the EU’s deal; he wants us to have an à la carte menu. Well, you may give him some concessions and you may not. His real plan is of course to deflect all of this so that there is not a referendum for five years. That or not, actually the longer this debate goes on, the more likely the UK is to leave the European Union. This debate will not stop and I am pleased to say that democracy, the arguments for democracy, are now staging a fight back and I look forward to when the United Kingdom does get that referendum. And I hope that many other countries will follow our lead, including Ireland, in claiming back their rights of democracy and self-government. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, there is a certain sense of irony here this morning because this is of course the week when you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, this great achievement. I thought the award bizarre, particularly as what we are discussing this morning is a new range of measures that will further pile on the agony for those southern euro zone states. Europe is now split from north to south, with increasing violence and enmity between the peoples of the north of Europe and the south of Europe, so I do not think the Peace Prize was really very appropriate. Not, of course, that that will pose you a problem tomorrow, because there are no leaders in those southern European countries who, frankly, have got the courage to stand up to the might of Brussels and challenge the euro zone project. However what you will have at tomorrow’s summit, yet again, is the curious case of Mr Cameron. On the one hand, he is a big ally. He resists having a referendum. He publicly states again and again that he wants Britain to remain a member of the European Union and, surprisingly, he has supported every one of your moves towards a fiscal union and banking union. Mr Verhofstadt indeed called Mr Cameron the greatest federalist outside the euro zone. Yet, on the other hand, he cannot go along with any of this because, politically, the financial transaction tax and the banking union are quite impossible in Britain. But every time there is a summit and the euro zone moves that little bit further forward, it leaves Britain — and Mr Cameron — even more marginalised. In fact it is barely worth him turning up tomorrow.  The great debate in Britain has always been that the single market has been the victory of our membership of the Union, and that we have great influence over that single market. Well, increasingly we are going to be excluded from the key decisions that affect that single market. Given the hostility – and I am sorry to disappoint my Conservative friends here, but there is hostility towards Britain in this place now, where people blame their economic problems on our City of London — frankly, the argument that the single market benefits Britain and that we have any influence over it is now disappearing, and very shortly I think you will be glad to see the back of us.

The story goes – Mr Cameron’s story and Mr Barroso’s story and the story of most people here – that the euro is something that needs to be saved. Therefore, the more money we throw at it, and the more guarantees we put behind, the better it is, because the break up of the euro zone would be a very difficult and perhaps perilous course to go down.  I am afraid that there is a problem with this. Nothing that is being done, whether it is the banking union or the fiscal union, does a single thing to change the problem that there is a massive gap in terms of competitiveness between the German economy and the Mediterranean economies. If we carry on down this route of saving the euro, we will probably finish up with violent revolution in those southern Mediterranean states. So I would say that it would be better, if we were good Europeans, to break up the euro zone and recognise that Greece, Spain and Portugal should never have joined in the first place. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, when I first starting standing up in this place and saying that I thought the euro project was flawed and would end very badly, I was met with a wall of derision in this House, and I must admit it was a very lonely old game. But now there is a growing number of people here who recognise the flaws in the euro project, and out in Europe roughly half the population of the EU and the euro zone now regret going into the currency.  But I was pleased to see this week that an even bigger voice is now being heard amongst the experts in the financial community. The Danish Bank – Saxo Bank – said that the euro zone leaders are behaving like drug addicts and alcoholics. And how right Saxo Bank are, because you keep on taking that same drug that is doing you and the peoples of Europe so much damage. It is time for some recognition. The Mediterranean states do not fit into the euro zone, and if this summit pushes on towards banking and fiscal union, it will not help anybody: it is going to break up in the end. Nigel Farage  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, it is received wisdom here that all the economic problems in the European Union, and in particular the shambles of the euro zone, are all caused by the Anglo-Saxon capital markets and therefore they must be attacked. That is what the financial transaction tax is really all about. And it says two things to me.  Firstly, this unilateral approach on financial transaction tax, on global warming policy, on all of these things, is rendering Europe the low-growth economic disaster zone of the world. This is a self-inflicted wound. These countries that are doing it are damaging their ability to do this business.  Secondly, even though the British Government sensibly are not going along with this, the very fact that this was proposed and that over two thirds of the tax would have been raised from the City of London, tells me we should not be in this club at all. It was put in place to damage financial markets and in particular to damage Britain. It is a bad idea for us and it is a bad idea for you too. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, Prime Minister Cameron heads to Brussels tomorrow – I think, on ‘Mission Impossible’ – but it is a remarkable debate, in that the European Union is talking about taking another trillion euros from European taxpayers, despite the fact that the accounts have not been signed off for 18 years in a row. If this was a company, the directors, in this case the Commission, would all be in prison. But never mind; Mr Cameron will go and he will argue for a freeze, or what he means by a freeze, which is the same over-bloated budget with increases for inflation. And that actually is the very best that he can achieve in these negotiations. I have no doubt that, when he comes home, the UK taxpayer will have an even bigger bill. This will not work because the public mood in Britain is now very clear: what our taxpayers are saying is that enough is enough. No longer do we wish to pay money to Hungarian companies involved in projects that improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs. And our patience has completely snapped at such cultural absurdities as the EUR 400 000 given to the Flying Gorillas dance troupe who, using their own language of ‘rhythm, music and gibberish’ – they would fit in well here, would they not? – give performances such as the brilliant Smelly Foot dance, with an acoustic score that includes some ‘spectacular belching’. No, I am not making it up. I think the British public are angry at the fleets of chauffeur-driven cars, at the extravagant buildings and the never-ending travelling circus that is the European Parliament. We pay GBP 53 million a day to be a member of this organisation for no benefit whatsoever. Mr Cameron, when you come back from this Brussels summit, why do you not accept my challenge and let us have a proper full debate on Britain and whether it is worth staying a member of this Union or not. The last opinion polls over the weekend show that, by a majority of two to one, the British people now want us to leave this Union and not to pay you a penny piece.

– There is a parliamentary tradition of MPs entering assemblies but wishing to use their position in the interests of secession. We saw it with the Irish nationalists in the 19th century. Indeed, Sinn Fein run for elections to the UK Parliament, and the Scottish National Party sit in the UK Parliament. We came here because we felt that the British public were not being told what was happening in Europe and how much it was costing. We have used our position here to try to get that information back to the British public. Given that now, by a majority of two to one, the Brits want to leave this Union, I would say that we are doing a pretty good job. (Applause) Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, what we have seen this morning from the Commission and Parliament is a passionate defence of high salaries, index-linked pensions, chauffeur-driven cars and a lifestyle that none of you would actually enjoy out there in the real competitive world. It is the status quo: convincing itself that it you are doing a good job despite the fact that the public increasingly doubt you. I would remind you that every time taxpayers’ money is thrown at common European projects the results are less than a success. The common fisheries policy and its environmental degradation and now of course the euro are not just an economic but a social disaster which is engulfing the Mediterranean and it is all based on flawed thinking that the State if it has power and money can create wealth. The dead hand of bureaucracy is destroying innovation and destroying jobs in Europe. National democracy and free markets would be a much better model. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President: Mr Van Rompuy, when you first appeared here, in what proved to be a rather expensive speech I said you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy – and sure enough, in your dull and technocratic way, you have gone about your course. But I have to say you are even worse than I thought you were going to be. I thought it was just going to be a federal Europe – a federal Union – but actually it appears, with every statement you make, that what you now want is the total subjugation of states to completely undemocratic structures based in Brussels. I misread the bailouts. I thought that when the bailouts happened and I could see the panic around this Chamber, with people fearing economic meltdown... But you, of course, were calm through it all, because you saw the bailouts as your opportunity to take control. Just think how Ireland today has managed, and Greece, for that matter. The sinister-sounding troika come in, 50 officials spend a few days in the country, investigate the situation and then tell puppet prime ministers what they may or may not do. I note great enthusiasm in this Chamber for Spain to have a bailout: lots of Members here want Spain to accept the bailout, so that they too are subjugated to this new order. Indeed in Italy, the appointee there, Mr Monti, is very keen for his own country to be bailed out because, to quote him, he fears that parliamentary democracy could bring down the European Union. It is pretty clear that your next phase is for those that have not been bailed out and may not need to be bailed out. You now want them to sign budget guarantees and to have the power to strike down national budgets after they have been through parliaments. I have to say I feel that the eurozone is now in a very dark place economically, socially and politically, and I fear that the countries trapped inside it, in that prison, will be there for many years to come. So it is odd that, against this backdrop, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the European Union. It is true that Germany has not invaded France since 1945, but I do not think there is any prospect of that happening – unless what you are all saying is that the Germans are inherently bad people. No, the threat actually came from Russia, and we should be thanking NATO and millions of American soldiers who served on European soil to maintain peace. Yet I do not hear a word of that, because we loathe America and everything that it stands for. No, this is now a divided, split Europe, with neo-Nazi politics on the rise and violent demonstrations in the streets. Frankly, I think that the award of that Nobel Prize devalues that whole organisation. It is not all bad news, because in Britain the opinion polls are clear that a clear, settled majority of Brits now want to leave this Union, leaving David Cameron as piggy in the middle, trying to pretend to be a Eurosceptic when he comes over here, going back home and claiming victories – but he is stuck. I predict one thing: big political change is coming in Britain, because he is losing the support of millions of his own voters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 The EU has a vindictive, neocolonialist trade and aid policy towards the world’s poorest countries. It refuses to trade on fair terms with them, and has a desire to bully them economically. Much of the poverty and insecurity in the world’s poorest countries was created by the EU in the first place. Outside of the EU, the UK could pursue policies that genuinely help. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, I begin today on a happy note remembering that it is 20 years ago this very week since the United Kingdom, having been signed up by the Conservative Government to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, broke out of the ERM. It was a great liberation for us and, of course, once having been bitten we did not join the euro project, thank goodness. Sadly, the same is not true for much of the rest of Europe. I thought, through the last 18 months or so, that the economic logic of why Britain left the ERM would apply, particularly to those Mediterranean countries, and I foresaw that actually those countries would leave the euro zone, probably with Greece leaving this year. But I now have to accept that I have been wrong about that, because I had totally underestimated the complete fanaticism of you, Mr Barroso, your college of Commissioners, and the European Central Bank. You have come out fighting on all fronts. Today you announced that there is going to be a banking union, yet more centralised control, yet more regulation. You make it clear that whilst you think the nation state should continue to exist, it must not have any democratic powers. All democracy is to be vested here under what you call the ‘Community method’ which of course means that your unelected Commission has the sole right to present that legislation, so I do not believe you when you say that and I find the tone of much of what has been said and done over the last few days really very worrying. Mario Draghi, now known by some that believe in the euro as Super Mario, showed us his big bazooka the other day. He upped the stakes and he told us – and to me it is an odd concept – that he had unlimited money. Now, I do not think money grows on trees and I think that money is limited to what the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayers are prepared to put in, but he has made clear his intention: he will fight to the last German taxpayer to keep the Mediterranean countries that should never have joined the euro in there. And now you have of course the Prime Minister of Italy – perhaps we ought to call him Monstrous Mario – who made it clear last week that he feared that nation state democracy could bring down the European Union and therefore we have to by-pass nation state democracy and pass all the powers here. Your henchman Olli Rehn, who is here today, dares to tell countries when they should and should not have general elections. He is urging Spain to accept a full bailout so that they too are trapped in the euro prison. I have to accept that you now have the whip hand over the citizens of Europe and I now think that this euro crisis will go on for a whole miserable decade. In the end, you will have to face the reality that even France and Germany cannot survive together in the same economic and monetary union and certainly with President Hollande reducing retirement ages, upping minimum wages and bringing in a hate tax for the successful, which will see all the entrepreneurs leave France, I am afraid that gap will get bigger. I wonder where the hope comes for those who believe in nation state democracy. We have heard that the German court this morning has decided that the ESM is OK. Maybe the Finns will say they have had enough. Maybe the Germans as a country will say they are no longer going to go on feeling ashamed and guilty for what their grandparents’ generation did and will start to stand up for their own economic interest. I do not know, but I suspect that the best hope we have actually comes from the United Kingdom, where the demand for a referendum is stronger than it has ever been, where our Conservative Prime Minister is in very deep trouble. I think today, Mr Barroso, the British people hearing you calling for the European Union to become a global power, making it absolutely clear that Member States must obey what you tell them, whether they are in the relatively wealthy north or the poorer south, I think those comments, this emerging, creeping, Euro-dictatorship is something that will repulse millions of British people. The only good news I take from today is that you have helped to bring that referendum just a little bit closer. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I think the point about listening is a very good one – a very good one. You should have listened when the French people voted ‘No’ to the European constitution, but you chose to ignore them. You should have listened when the Dutch by a massive majority of two to one said ‘No’ to the constitution, but you did not. You rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty without conceding a single power; you bulldozed it through, and here this morning we hear talk of a new treaty and a new constitution. When little Ireland not once but twice dared to vote ‘No’ in a referendum on European integration, you did not listen, you bullied them to make them vote again. You are the one, Sir, who is not listening. (Applause) Nigel Farage,

Mr President, Mr Barroso claims to be a good democrat. It is a very twisted form of democracy when he says that all of those political parties that get votes with which you do not agree are not relevant. It is a pretty obscene definition of democracy to decry those of us that believe in national democracy and European cooperation. Mr Barroso calls us populists, extremists, xenophobic and nationalistic. Surely Mr Barroso, the point about democracy is that you engage in debate. You listen to what the other person has to say, you put it to the public and you accept the result. That is what real, genuine parliamentary democracy is about, and you seem to actually despise that and everything that those of us that stand for national democracy believe in. And to tell me that you are in this position because this Parliament voted for you! We were only given the chance to vote for one candidate! Is that your new model of European democracy? (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

blue-card answer. 
–
 I think I had better be slightly careful how I answer the last part of that question. Mr Brok, the British Prime Minister is taken from the floor of the House of Commons and in fact nearly the entire British Government are elected Members of that House of Commons. That is the Government of the United Kingdom. The fundamental difference between that and the European Union is that this College of Commissioners that you see over here – the people who have the sole right to propose legislation with the European system – not one of them has been voted for by anybody in Europe and therefore they cannot be removed. That is why the European system is not just undemocratic, it is anti-democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, under the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament, if you, as the President, wish to enter into a debate, that is fine. You are allowed to do so but you first have to leave the Chair. I would suggest what you just did was to enter into that debate from the Chair, and that is not the way this, or any other Chamber, should be conducted. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, that is the 19th crisis summit that Mr Cameron has been to. As the Rolling Stones might say, the 19th nervous breakdown, and that is reflected I think by the funereal mood in this Chamber this morning. Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off. This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble. There is also a massive crisis of leadership. It is lovely to see you, Mr Van Rompuy. You have not been here for many months; it is delightful to have you back. Last time you were here, you told us we had turned the corner, that the worst of the crisis was over. With every one of your predictions, it goes on getting worse. I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America. You have made yourselves an international laughing stock. You do not have any credibility. But one piece of helpful advice from me: do not this summer go on any billionaires’ yachts on extended holidays, because the markets guarantee we will all be back here in August. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, another one bites the dust. Country No 4, Spain, gets bailed out, and we all of course know that it will not be the last. However, I wondered over the weekend whether perhaps I was missing something, because the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, said that this bailout shows what a success the eurozone has been. I thought, well, having listened to him over the previous couple of weeks telling us there would not be a bailout, I have the feeling, after all his twists and turns, that he is just about the most incompetent leader in the whole of Europe – and that is saying something because there is pretty stiff competition! Indeed, every single prediction of yours, Mr Barroso, has been wrong, and dear old Herman Van Rompuy, well, he has done a runner has he not? The last time he was here, he told us we had turned the corner and that the euro crisis was over; he has not bothered to come back and see us since. I remember being here 10 years ago and listening to the launch of the Lisbon Agenda. We were told that with the euro, by 2010, we would have full employment and, indeed, that Europe would be the competitive and dynamic powerhouse of the world. By any objective criteria, the euro has failed and, in fact, there is a looming impending disaster. This deal makes things worse, not better. EUR 100 billion is being put up for the Spanish banking system and 20% of that money has to come from Italy. Under the deal, the Italians have to lend to the Spanish banks at 3%, but to get that money they have to borrow on the markets at 7%. It is genius, is it not! It really is brilliant. So what we are doing with this package is actually driving countries like Italy towards needing to be bailed out themselves. In addition to that, we have put a further 10% on Spanish national debt and I will tell you – and any banking analyst will tell you – that EUR 100 billion will not solve the Spanish problem; it would need to be more like EUR 400 billion. With Greece teetering on the edge of euro withdrawal, the real elephant in the room is that once Greece leaves, the European Central Bank is bust. It is gone. It has EUR 444 billion worth of exposure to the bailed-out countries and to rectify that there will need to be a cash call on Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy! You could not make it up, could you? It is total and utter failure. This ship – the Euro Titanic – has now hit the iceberg and, sadly, there simply are not enough lifeboats. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we are in the midst of an economic and increasingly humanitarian crisis and yet Commission President Barroso is not here. Indeed, Herman Van Rompuy is not here either, not that it really matters because they are not prepared to listen to any debate or any argument. They are intent on pursuing their political dream of a United States of Europe and are prepared to commit economic suicide for an entire continent. And tomorrow night Mr Van Rompuy has called yet another summit at which he is going to present a strategy for growth and jobs. Elected MEPs, representatives of the people of Europe, from left and right, we have heard it all before. Remember the euro itself was supposed to create growth and jobs and yet it is actively destroying both of those things. The remedy we are being offered is more of the same. I would suggest that the medicine is killing the patient and to increase the dosage is madness. Do not listen to those who will tell you that the only alternative is for Greece to stay in the euro. Everyone is pushing this. David Cameron and all the other leaders are saying that we must keep Greece in the euro; if she leaves, the sky will fall in. It will not. There will be a few difficult weeks and then things will settle down. There will be a boom in tourism. Investment will start to come back into Greece. Innovation will start to come back into Greece as people start making products to beat expensive imports. Indeed, Greece outside the eurozone may well prove to be an inspiration for Spain, for Portugal and for many other countries. We need to recognise that a terrible mistake has been made. We must resolve to put it right. We have got to give people hope because out there now is absolute despair. We all remember Dimitris Christoulas, the 77-year-old former pharmacist who shot himself dead outside the Greek Parliament, but he is just one of a growing humanitarian disaster. There have been huge increases in suicides in Italy and in Greece, particularly by people running small businesses who cannot see a way out of the problem. Children are being left in increasing numbers outside the doors of churches because their parents cannot afford to feed them. Our leaders are too callous to listen and care. You can do something about this. You can rise up and say – and I know from my conversations with you that many of you agree with me – that I am right. We have got to break up the euro. We have got to restore democracy. We have got to restore human dignity. We must ignore Messrs Barroso and Van Rompuy. They have been proved to be wrong. We must provide people with hope.

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, I would say to Mr Papanikolaou that a reintroduced drachma would probably be 50 to 60% lower than its current value in the euro, something like that. Clearly, I am not advocating that we move to a new fixed peg; I am advocating floating currency rates because history shows us that every time we try to fix currency pegs, we get it wrong. The risk, of course, is that the cost of imports would rise, which is why I said that what it would also lead to is innovation in Greece, as people started to make products to undercut the price of foreign imports. But I tell you what it would give: it would give Greece a chance, because stuck inside the euro you are going to be literally destroyed. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, happy Schuman Day, or Europe Day as you now call it, although I thought the celebrations were rather muted. The only bit of real passion we had was Mr Schulz slagging off the English, but that now appears to be a sort of popular sport in this Parliament. When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I am not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore. I think we are celebrating the wrong day. We should not be celebrating 9 May; we should be celebrating 8 May: Victory in Europe Day. We should celebrate the last time the Germans tried to smash the continent and they foundered and at least half the continent got its democracy back. What we are celebrating on 9 May is another attempt, through different means, to smash democracy across Europe. I do not doubt for a minute that Jean Monnet was well intentioned at the start; he thought that if you abolish nation states, you would stop there ever being another war. He did not, at the time, of course, have the benefit of seeing that theory as it played out in Yugoslavia. But, like Communism, this has all gone badly wrong and the EU Titanic has now hit the iceberg. It is a European Union of economic failure, of mass unemployment, of low growth but, worst of all, it is an EU with the economic prism of the euro and this now poses huge dangers to the continent. We face the prospect of mass civil unrest, possibly even revolution, in some countries that are being driven into total and utter desperation. But there is perhaps an opportunity; there is perhaps some good news. Now a democratic rebellion has begun. It began in Finland last year with the True Finns getting nearly 20% of the vote and we are seeing in country after country new political movements on the Right and on the Left making big scores. But that may not be all good news because what we saw in Greece last Sunday was rather reminiscent of the German election of 1932. We saw the status quo Centre collapse and the extremes of Right and Left rise. You know, this project could even cause the rebirth of National Socialism in Europe. We are headed the wrong way. We must break up the eurozone; we must set those Mediterranean countries free; we must try to build a Europe. I want a Europe, but a Europe based on trade, a Europe based on cooperation, a Europe based on us sitting round the table and agreeing sensible rules on crime and the environment. We can do all of those things but we cannot do them if we are asked to rally behind that flag. I owe no allegiance to that flag and nor do most of the people in Europe either. (Applause from the EFD Group) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is a great shame Mr Van Rompuy is not here, because a month ago, he told us that the worst was over and we had reached the turning point; he even told us that he had solved the euro crisis. Today, we have a more realistic Mr Barroso, who says that if we follow his policies and stick together, we can solve this in the end. Sorry, no one believes you anymore, and actually, in the face of the rapidly deteriorating situation, these comments look ridiculous. In Spain, mass unemployment gathers by the day, and internal democracy in Spain is now under threat. In Italy – where we were told Mr Monti would sort it all out – growth figures are falling and the bond spreads are worsening. Now an IMF official has come out and said that it is obvious that at some point a euro break-up will happen. These are big changes: the euro is doomed, and with your policies, Sir – even if Greece accepts the austerity you are imposing on them, and even if, for the next eight years, they obey all this – in 2020, they will still have a debt GDP ratio of 120%, which makes one ask: what is the point? In Spain: if Spain was able to increase ... the difference is, Sir, Britain is not trapped inside the economic prison of the euro. Now take this: if Spain was to increase, if she increased her productivity growth by half a per cent a year (which at the moment looks unlikely), it would take her forty years to close the competitiveness gap with Germany. These countries were sucked in to a totally false economic boom with artificially low interest rates, and they are now paying the price. These policies cannot succeed. Mercifully, outside of this institution, economists the world over now say it is inevitable that the euro will break up; it is just a question of how. I really hope that the IMF now decides to stop pouring good money after bad into these bailouts, and I really do hope that not one penny piece more of British taxpayers’ money goes into propping something up that should be allowed to die.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I see that Mr Van Rompuy is back for another two-and-a-half years, no doubt a reward for his great success. Indeed, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you, I thought perhaps I had got it all wrong. You talked about how positive the last Council meeting had been, that we have reached the turning point, that everything is going swimmingly, and I was beginning to believe it. And then I realised that you did not mention the D word: Default. No, that cannot be talked about. We pretend there has not been a default when we know, in fact, that in Greece last week, there was a very major credit event. Indeed, listening to all of you this morning reminds me of the great British comedy classic Carry On Up the Khyber
, where the colonial English go on having dinner, ignoring the fact that impending disaster is all around them. You are determined but delusional in this attempt to keep the euro propped up. And whilst you are enjoying your dinner, incoming shells are landing all around you: youth unemployment in Greece went through 50% last week. That is fine, carry on, serve the main course. And you will have seen yesterday that 110 German bondholders of Greek bonds are now going to take legal action against the banks and against the Greek Government. But do not worry chaps; carry on; everything is going to be fine. But perhaps the biggest bombshell is the German Finance Minister saying just yesterday that nobody can exclude a third bail-out. Pass the port. Do enjoy the party. It is a farcical situation, and why is it happening? That is what people in Europe want to know. Why is this happening? Is this being done to help Greece? No. It is going to crucify Greece. It is being done to prop up a failing project because you know that once Greece goes, others will go as well. And some of the language is telling. Mr Barroso, when leaders stand up and say that political moves are irreversible, history has one lesson: you are always, always, going to be proved to be wrong. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the Commissioner picked the right man: puppet Papademos is in place and, as Athens caught fire on Sunday night, he rather took my breath away. He said: ‘violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country’. What democratic country? He is not even a democratically elected Prime Minister. He has been appointed by you guys. Greece is not run through democracy now, it is run through a Troika: three foreign officials who fly into Athens airport and tell the Greeks what they can and cannot do. The violence and destruction that you saw on Sunday is being caused directly because people are having their democratic rights taken from them; what else can they do? If I were a Greek citizen, I would have been out there joining those protests on Sunday; I would be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people. In the puppet’s efforts to get the MPs to vote for the bail-out package, he warned them that if they did not do so, there would be a dramatic decline in living standards. Has he looked outside the front door? Has he seen the fact that 50% of the young people are unemployed already? Has he seen the fact that the economy, far from stalling, has contracted for five years in a row, and is now accelerating on a downward debt spiral, a contraction of 7% per annum? Greece is being driven into the ground, and when it comes to chaos, you ain’t seen nothing yet. These policies are driving Greece towards a revolution. They need to be set free. If they do not get the drachma back, you will be responsible for something truly, truly horrible. (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP MEPs abstained on this resolution because, although we agree with some elements, we strongly disagree with others, in particular, the imposition of a financial transaction tax. Since the only option was a single vote on the report in its entirety, we could not support the GUE/NGL proposal. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, first of all I would like to say: congratulations everybody! David Cameron had you worried for a bit, you even thought he was a Eurosceptic, but it is OK. You have had a quiet word with him and the real David Cameron is back. Whatever happened to the veto? No more vetoes any more. Indeed, Mr Cameron is now actively supporting this quite despicable pact, this plan to destroy and humiliate nation states that do not live up to a Germanic view of how economies ought to be run. I must say I thought the weekend’s proposals from the German finance ministry suggesting that a European Commissioner and his staff occupy a big building in Athens and take over the running of the country – a Gauleiter, some might say – must be joke. Even this EU, I thought, could not possibly sink to those depths – but of course it was just a negotiating position and what we now have for Greece is diplomacy at gunpoint. It is the kind of strategy that Palmerston used against Athens back in the 19th century. Nobody can deny today that Greece is no more than a colony. And this is all a terrible, huge mistake. Greece is not a failing subsidiary company where head office needs to come in and take control. Greece is a nation with a soul, a nation with pride, with history – goodness me, they invented democracy in the first place. They are suffering. They have youth unemployment of 50% caused, Mr Van Rompuy, because they are in the euro. You are causing the misery in these countries and you blather on about creating jobs and growth. None of this is actually going to happen. And remember, these people are being driven into humiliation and desperation. Desperate people do desperate things, and I am deeply fearful for what will happen in Greece if we continue with this mad course. And of course, as Mr Barroso knows, it is going to be Portugal next. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Blue-card answer to Reinhard Bütikofer. 
–
 Mr President, I did not use the word ‘Gauleiter’, I said ‘as some might say’, and indeed the biggest selling Sunday newspaper in Britain used that word. If you want to talk about hatred, just look at what this European project is doing. We have German newspapers slagging off the Italians for being cowards, slagging off the Greeks for being lazy and useless, and we have Italian and Greek newspapers depicting leading figures in Germany wearing Nazi uniforms. Surely the whole point is that this project that was designed to bring us all together in peace and harmony is actually ripping us apart and bringing back nationalisms. And if there was one country I really had a go at in my speech, it was actually the United Kingdom because I admitted the way we behaved towards Greece in the 19th century was not acceptable. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, there is a very bad case of denial in this Chamber this morning, a total refusal to accept that the euro project is failing. Greece is on the verge of a default. The bail-out fund is creaking. The credibility of the European Central Bank itself is now being called into question. It is all on the verge of going belly-up, and yet when the credit rating agencies tell the truth you try and pretend it is not happening. In fact Mr Brok and others were suggesting that it is all some dastardly plot by the Americans, the British and the Anglo Saxon markets to bring down the euro. The agencies are nothing more than the canary in the mine. They are telling you the truth, so please listen to Standard and Poor’s when they say that austerity alone will not work. You are driving these countries into depression just to save your euro project. But I must acknowledge that you have lost absolutely nothing when it comes to your powers of deception. No, that is still very much on course. It was Nick Clegg who gave us the clue – a man who, I suspect, is rather more popular here than he is back home these days. Clegg was asked whether there should be a referendum on the forthcoming treaty. He said there was no need for that because it was all going to be ‘folded into’ the existing treaties. I thought, ‘What the dickens is he talking about?’ Well, now I have learnt. Mr Cohn-Bendit made it clear: it is to be the ‘Community method’. It is to be legislation where you know you have a majority in this Parliament and you know, under qualified majority in the Council, you can get everything through. Why are you doing it this way? It is simple, is it not? – it is to avoid referendums. Because you know that if a treaty was put to Ireland and many other countries, the answer would be ‘no’. The peoples of Europe do not want this sado-monetarist package. The peoples of Europe, particularly in the case of the South, need to get out of the euro, to have devaluation and a chance to re-establish themselves again. You are denying them that chance and, by pushing the ‘Community method’, you are destroying democracy in Europe. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President – President Schulz – good morning to you. I know it is my job to congratulate you but, given that we knew this result two-and-a-half years ago, as a result of a stitch-up, there really does not seem to be much point. After all, nobody in modern-day Europe would ever have a big, powerful job that was decided upon by a full, open process. I am sure Mr Barroso would agree. I was musing this morning. I was thinking about what kind of President Schulz we were going to get. Are we going to get a dignified, calm figure who behaves like the Speaker of all great parliaments around the world, somebody who puts himself above politics and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day arguments and is an ambassador, indeed a statesman? Or are we going to get the Martin Schulz we have got to know since 2004 as leader of the Socialist Group? You know the one I mean: snarling, angry, unable to control his temper, intolerant of anybody with an alternative point of view, somebody who is contemptuous when, in free referendums, people have the temerity to vote ‘no’, somebody who is anti-British to his fingertips and does not like free markets? I was wondering which one we would get. Well, your opening speech has settled that question for me. It is pretty clear that we are going to have two-and-a-half years of political fanaticism from the Chair. I have to say that only a third-world country, only a banana republic, would want to have an overtly political President of a parliament, but that is what we have got. Mr Schulz, I may represent the smallest group in this Parliament, but I can tell you that it is a group whose ideas and whose views are now being echoed by a growing number of citizens right across this continent. I am sure you would agree that the opinion polls show that it is about 50-50 whether people think this EU is a good thing or a bad thing. What we represent is not anti-Europeanism. That is not what it is about. We believe in nation-state democracy. We want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of cooperation and we want a Europe that is responsible. We do not want a Europe that seeks to be a global superpower. We do not want a Europe run by Mr Barroso and the Commission, and the so-called Community method. I will do my very best to provide political opposition to your Presidency over the next two-and-a-half years and I hope you give us a fair hearing.

– UKIP supports democracy and human rights. However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers. We do however, feel the accusations of vote rigging in Russia are serious, and would like to see these allegations investigated by a third party. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have often asked myself the question: why would a successful country that has enjoyed a thousand years of independence give up its right of self-government to the unelected nonentities that we see sitting before us this morning? The answer that comes back from the Foreign Office and the great and the good is that we must have influence in Europe. We must have a seat at the top table and we can change things. We have done our best to prove what good Europeans we are. We go on paying you GBP 50 million a day. We have helped the euro bailout fund, even though we did not join the currency, thank goodness. We have given you 80% of the fish stocks that swim in our waters – your fleets can come and take that from us – and we have applied every directive you have given us absolutely to the letter, all of it to gain influence. In fact, Nick Clegg is so deluded he still thinks we can take the lead in Europe. When a British Prime Minister goes to a summit with a very modest proposal to protect a uniquely important British industry, a snarling President Sarkozy tells him where to go, with German approval of course, and we find ourselves without a friend in the room. Some influence! Well you have decided to head off on the Titanic towards economic and democratic disaster, and we are now in a lifeboat outside the Titanic, but we are threatened by a bow wave that is going to come and engulf us if we are not careful – and it is retribution. We have heard the language of retribution this morning. Financial markets legislation is going to be imposed upon Britain and we will have no influence whatsoever over any of it. Something changed though on Friday. Mr Cameron may not know it, but we are now on course: Britain is going to make the great escape. We are going to get out of this Union. We will be the first European country to get our freedom back. I suspect many others will follow, and then what we will have is our democracy back, our liberty back, and we will have influence in the world as you lot head for disaster. It is going to happen.

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, I have to say that that is a very difficult question to answer because there were half of dozen of them thrown in there. David Cameron did what he had to do; he was forced into an impossible position but, you are right, Mr Smyth: he has gained no concessions whatsoever and he has actually now left the United Kingdom even more vulnerable than it was before. We are in a permanent voting minority, we simply have not got a friend in the room, and we have heard this morning that they want to have our rebate, they want financial market legislation. However, he has opened a debate in Britain. The European debate has now started in earnest. Cameron does not know what he has unleashed. I think the momentum for us to have a referendum to divorce ourselves from these failing structures and to replace them with a genuine free trade agreement now has an unstoppable momentum, and that is good for the UK and it is good for Scotland. It will be good for your financial sector based in Edinburgh and will provide many, many jobs for Scottish people. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, I recently visited Croatia; I wanted to find out whether a proper national debate was going on, whether there was a fair campaign. What did I find? Well I found that the EU is doing everything it can to bribe the political class in Croatia. Doing it quite well too. Already the EU has given EUR 320 million to Croatia in what is called pre-accession aid; the EU has just spent a million euros on a blatant propaganda advertising campaign telling Croatia that the EU is their only hope. Cleverly, you have even given jobs to Croatians – highly paid jobs to Croatians in the European Parliament and in the European Commission – just to show them how well off they – the ruling class – will be if they join. And you have got EU flags flying on official buildings all over the country, to give the impression that it is a done deal. You have some willing helpers because the old Communists are still there in Croatia. They still hold all the positions of power and they will all become personally enormously wealthy if Croatia joins the European Union. There is an even more sinister side to this because there is not a free press in Croatia. There is no national debate going on at all. Indeed a prize has been offered – HRK 10 000 – if anybody can find an article in any Croatian newspaper suggesting that joining is not the right thing to do. The whole campaign is bent, corrupt and distorted. We have seen this before from the European Union, but I think it is happening on a scale in Croatia that is worse than I have seen before. This country has for nearly a thousand years sought independence and for 20 years they have had independence. They got out of the failed political experiment that was Yugoslavia. If they vote to join the European Union, they are voting to rejoin a new Yugoslavia, a failing political experiment that will implode. I hope there is, in the last month or two, a debate in Croatia. Sadly, I doubt it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, here we are, on the edge of a financial and social disaster, and in the room today we have the four men who were supposed to be responsible. Yet we have listened to the dullest, most technocratic speeches I have ever heard. You are all in denial. By any objective measure, the euro is a failure. Who is actually responsible? Who is in charge out of you lot? Well of course the answer is none of you, because none of you have been elected. None of you actually have any democratic legitimacy for the roles that you currently hold within this crisis. Into this vacuum, albeit reluctantly, has stepped Angela Merkel. We are now living in a German-dominated Europe – something that the European project was actually supposed to stop, and something that those that went before us actually paid a heavy price in blood to prevent. I do not want to live in a German-dominated Europe and nor do the citizens of Europe, but you guys have played a role. When Mr Papandreou got up and used the word ‘referendum’, you, Mr Rehn, described it as ‘a breach of confidence’, and your friends here got together like a pack of hyenas, rounded on Papandreou, and had him removed and replaced by a puppet government. What an absolutely disgusting spectacle that was. And not satisfied with that, you decided that Berlusconi had to go, so he was removed and replaced by Mr Monti – a former European Commissioner, a fellow architect of this euro disaster, and a man who was not even a member of the Parliament. It is getting like an Agatha Christie novel where we are trying to work out who is going to be the next person who is going to be bumped off. The difference is that we know who the villains are. You should all be held accountable for what you have done. You should all be fired. I have to say, Mr Van Rompuy, that 18 months ago when we first met, I was wrong about you. I said that you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy, but you are not any more. You are rather noisy about it, are you not? You, an unelected man, went to Italy and said that this is not the time for elections but the time for actions. What, in God’s name, gives you the right to say that to the Italian people?

– Mr President, I am always prepared to accept that I might be wrong and I thought the democratic revolution against this euro lunacy was confined to Northern Europe, but now we see that Slovakia has joined it and I must say what a wonderful result that was last night in Slovakia. I am sure many of you here will agree. It has produced, I think, the quote of the crisis. Richard Sulik, who led the rebels said: ‘I would rather be a pariah in Brussels than have to feel ashamed before my children who would be deeper in debt’. Well I know how he feels because I have been somewhat of a pariah here perhaps for the last 10 years, but he has got it right because he summed up the detachment between Brussels and the real people of the European Union. Listening to this debate today, it is almost as if this debate has been going on inside a padded cell that is the European Parliament, as people compete for who can be the most stupid; who can waste the maximum amount of taxpayers’ money. I really do think as a political class you are all wrong, and you are all wrong democratically because nobody has ever given consent for this behaviour. When people vote ‘no’; when the French vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Dutch vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Irish vote ‘no’, you say vote again and get it right. When Slovakia votes ‘no’, we are told today it will all be OK because they can vote again this week until they get the right answer. We have 17 countries trapped inside this economic prison of the eurozone and all you can do, Mr Barroso, is stand up and say: we need more power. People like you – who have been the architect of this failure, the architect of the misery that is being inflicted upon millions – want more power. It is like Barroso in the bunker, unaware of what is happening in the outside world, but planning world domination. In economic terms, it is getting madder and madder. I hear that the new idea is that the bail-out fund will be multiplied, geared up times five, by the European Central Bank so that you have got your two trillion, Mr Verhofstadt. Two trillion – good God! Greece is going bankrupt. If you lot continue, the whole banking system in Europe is going to go bankrupt. The former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, this morning described the attempts to save the euro as the most gigantic Ponzi scheme. I am tempted to think he is right. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, Mr Barroso told us this morning that the European Union is an inspiration. Mr Barroso, whilst you admitted to there being one or two little economic problems, you made it perfectly clear that jobs and growth were to follow, that everything is going well. In fact you painted a vision that a new period of European renewal is upon us. As a former Communist yourself you probably remember the old Soviet leaders getting up to give their speeches and telling everybody that there was a record harvest or that tractor production figures were terribly good, and they of course believed that history was on their side. In fact President Khrushchev got up and said to the West: we will bury you. So much did he believe in his own Union. Now of course we look back at that and we laugh. I think that in our tomorrows people will look back at you and they will say: how on earth did this unelected man get all of this power and how did Europe’s political class sitting in this room decide that the Community method should replace national democracy? I think people will look back in astonishment that we have surrendered democracy. But what you want to do is to say, right, we have a European Union and what we have to do now is have more of it. So, as an architect – and you are one of the key architects of the current failure – you say that even though everything to date has been wrong we are going to do more of the same. I thought that was a definition of madness. I cannot believe that this is a rational response to any situation in which you find yourself and, far from it being a State of the Union, I would argue that the Union is in a state because just look at the confusion. We have got you as President of the European Commission, we have a President of the European Parliament; we have got my old friend Herman van Rompuy who is the permanent President of the European Council; we have got the Poles, they are now presidents temporarily of the European Council; we have got presidents all round this room. Goodness me, even I am a President. I am not sure what the collective noun for presidents is, perhaps an incompetence. I do not know. But certainly when you take away democratic accountability it is clear that nobody really is in charge and it is developing as a Union of intolerance. Anybody who stands up here and dares to give a political view which is different from the received wisdom is written off as mad, insane, violent and fascist; we have heard it for years from these people. The intolerance is so deep that, when we get referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland that reject your view, you as a political class see it as a problem to be overcome. So I am very worried about the whole root of this Union. There is a new nationalism that is sweeping Europe. You want to abolish the nation states, in your case, Mr Schulz, perhaps because you are ashamed of your past. And you now want this flag and a new anthem to replace nation states and you do not care how you get there. If you have to crush national democracy, if you have to oppose popular referendums, you just sweep this aside and say that it is populism. But it is not, it is democracy. What is sweeping northern Europe now, starting off in April with that amazing result in the Finnish general election, is a new democratic revolution. It is not anti-European. It wants a Europe of trade; it wants a Europe of cooperation; it wants a Europe where we can do student exchanges and we can work in each others’ capital cities; it wants those things. But it does not want this European Union model. Frankly, you are all now yesterday’s men. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, this point is often made, namely that a country like Britain is only 62 million people and are we not better off being part of a big European club so that we can have more of a voice on the world stage? Funny that, is it not? Here is Britain, the world’s fifth largest trading nation, which is now prohibited from going into World Trade Organisation talks because all of that is done, on our behalf, by an unelected European Commissioner. Mr Duff, the answer actually is that an independent Britain that trades and cooperates with her European neighbours in an age of globalisation would be able to forge her own trade relationships across the world. It would make sense for a country like ours to start off with the English-speaking world, which shares common law – our own kith and kin in the Commonwealth who we turned our backs on so shamefully. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, your detachment from reality is almost unbelievable. You are behaving like a political ostrich, pretending none of it is happening. You just told us a few moments ago that Greece fundamentally has no problems because it is a member of the eurozone. I mean, that is just deluded. You wrote recently that the euro’s 13-year history is a success story. Well, it is a very odd kind of success, is it not, and actually saying that frankly beggars belief and I think hardly makes you credible. I think it is about time that you and others in this room woke up to the fact that we are inflicting misery on millions of people through unemployment, through poverty, through a loss of democracy, and that it is an error to try and keep countries trapped inside the euro prison. The recent proposal is that Greece should write down her debts by 50% and remain a member of the eurozone. Surely, Mr Juncker, if that happens, the same would happen to Portugal and Ireland too. Do you think it is possible for any Member State of the euro to write down their debts and stay a member of the eurozone? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Very good, Mr Juncker, very good. Interesting. On this very point of credibility, you yourself said back in April that, when things become serious, you have to lie. That is what you said back in April. It seems to me that things are pretty serious and that, frankly, everything you say is a lie. The euro cannot, and should not, be held together under its current construction. It is about time that you admitted – you and all of you in this room – that you have got this wrong and countries like Greece need to be set free. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, there is a new mood in Strasbourg today, and during your speech, Mr Barroso, there was an all pervading sense of gloom. I saw for the first time even your own supporters shaking their heads. They do not believe in what you are saying. The European people do not believe in what you are saying, and I do not really think even you now believe in what you are saying. Because we all know that Greece is going to default. The end game for Greece is near. And you cannot say you were not warned. You were told the Treaties were fatally flawed. You were all told that Greece should never have joined the euro. And when I stood up here five years ago and talked about Greek bond spreads you treated me with such utter derision, it was as if I had been led out of the local lunatic asylum. No, you have been warned all the way through. So now what you have got is economic governance, and everybody here in this front row supports more European economic governance. What is European economic governance? I will tell you what it is: it is a plane landing in Athens airport out of which get an official from the Commission, an official from the European Central Bank and an official from the appalling IMF, and those three people – the troika you call them – go in, they meet the Greek Government and they tell the Greek Government what they may or may not do. You have killed democracy in Greece. You have three part-time overseas dictators that now tell the Greek people what they can and cannot do. It is totally unacceptable. Is it any wonder that Greek people are now burning EU flags and drawing swastikas across them? Frankly, unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and political prison you may well spark a revolution in that country. I suppose there is some good news at least, and that is that in Germany people are waking up; right up to the President people are saying all of this represents the death of democracy. None of this can work, and the German people will simply refuse in the end to pay the bill. Your one achievement is that you have split Europe between north and south. The Greeks now badmouth the Germans; the Germans badmouth the Greeks. I have one last plea, Mr Barroso: will you please help Greece? Help it to get its currency back. Help it to reschedule its debts. Help it out of the mess that you have put it into. Your policies have failed. Stand up, be a man, admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the Member is quite right. London has had some huge social problems, but they are not there today. The difference is that in Greece these protests go on day after day. I put it to you that if you rob people of the most powerful thing they possess in a free society, their ability to vote for and to fire their governments and their ability to be the masters of their own destiny, all they are left with is civil disobedience and violence. So what you are doing in the name of economic governance is something which is incredibly dangerous. Far from this European project being something that will engender peace, it is likely to do the very opposite. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in replying to Mr Tusk, having listened to his words this morning, I have to ask him this. In an age when the gap between ordinary voters and the European political class grows wider by the day, just what planet are you on? Why the pretence that everything is going incredibly well? The EU is mired in deep structural crisis. Greece, Portugal and Ireland cannot survive inside the euro. The Danes have torn up the Schengen agreement, and good for them, because the total free movement of peoples is a completely irresponsible thing to have done. Public opinion is saying that, whilst they want a European cooperation – yes, of course I agree with that – what they do not want is this Europe, run by unelected bureaucrats like Mr Barroso. You say the EU is fantastic in a recent comment. You are supporting the destruction of national democracy. But it is with reference to Greece that I am most concerned about you because, when faced with their recent enslavement, you said: ‘we lived for many years as a non-sovereign country, under Soviet occupation. For us, European integration is not a threat to sovereignty because we experienced not long ago a serious threat to our sovereignty’. So what are you saying? That this is not quite as bad as the USSR? Is that really good enough for your people? And today you describe Greece’s problems as trivial. I am sorry; there are hundreds of thousands of people out there on the streets of Greece fighting to get their democracy back. It beggars belief that you and our President, Mr Buzek, can talk about the Solidarity movement, about Poland getting its democracy back 20 years ago. Yet here you are, surrendering the democracy and sovereignty of Poland to a failed European Union. Yes, sir. We all want a shared European cooperation for the future, but this most definitely is not the model. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Mr Goebbels, post-1945, there were some very sensible ideas put together, namely, the Council of Europe. Let us have a Europe where we sit down together, where we have a free trade agreement and where we agree minimum standards on work and on the environment. We can do all of these things without a European Commission, without a European Parliament and without a European Court of Justice. We have done it in security terms with NATO. Yes, it will mean you will lose your job, Mr Barroso. But, apart from that, why can we not do things as mature democracies? Yes, Mr Schulz, I want you sacked as well – I want you all fired! We can do these things, and that is a positive way forward. By taking away from people their ability to govern themselves and transferring that power to the European Commission, we are headed for a Europe of rebellion and violence. Let us take the democratic route. (Mixed reactions) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– 1. We have previously voted against the following legislation, which removes our right to control our own food labelling. We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 – which prevents us labelling our own products as, for example, ‘Welsh beef’ and ‘Cheddar cheese’, without EU permission. 2. Further, it also gives the Commission unspecified powers to apply delegated acts in the future, thus changing the legislation in a manner which they choose, without reference to the EP members or any voting process in the EP. 3. We also have previously voted against the following legislation, which removes our right to control our own food labelling. We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, which even removes our power to freely designate a product as ‘English’ or ‘Welsh’ or ‘Scottish’: Article 2, section b: “ ‘geographical indication’ means the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country ...”.

 Mr Orbán, you are one of the few European leaders who has a grasp of history, believes in the nation state and champions democracy. I would say Hungary is lucky to have you. You have shown you are not prepared to be bullied by these EU nationalists. When you say that previously Hungary was dictated to by Moscow, and now it is Brussels, and you say that you are going to stand up to it, you actually mean it. So I think you have proved to be the secret weapon of the Eurosceptic movement. Your six-month tenure in this presidency has indeed been historic, because in the last six months the peoples of Europe have finally woken up to what a completely undemocratic and failing project this is. There have been some real highlights in your six months. In particular, one thinks back to the Finnish general election and the stunning success of the True Finns party. Who can blame ordinary taxpaying voters, in Finland or elsewhere, for saying that they do not want to go on bailing out this failed project called the euro? Well, hard on the heels of the Finnish result we had the third catastrophe, the third casualty; Mr Barroso’s own Portugal needed to be bailed out. Then of course we were back to Greece for the second bail-out, with people out rioting on the streets. But perhaps to cap it all, the real highlight of your presidency was that the Danes tore up the Schengen Agreement. So, all in all, I would say that you have had a remarkable, superb six months in office. More has happened to reawaken democracy and the future of the nation state perhaps than ever before. I think there is a growing realisation, both here and elsewhere, that the worm has turned, and we have seen the beginning of the end of this extremely dangerous project. Mr Orbán, jolly well done!

 I voted against the Balzani report on the mandate for the trilogue negotiations from the Budget committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for 2012 by 3.7% for commitments and 4.9% for payments. I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2011 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations.

 These two amendments (10 and 11) were supported to stop a cap or ceiling being introduced for direct payments. The effect of such a cap would be to create an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare as landowners sought to divide up large holdings to avoid the ceiling cutting their money: it represents the very worst sort of bureaucratic perverse incentive for questionable but probably legal behaviour. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is, he says there is no need for one. Mr Barroso, every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say, ‘no no, there is no problem’. Here we are, on the verge of the second Greek bail-out, and you say, ‘there is no alternative’. We must continue down this route. We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next. What a fine mess you have got us into. You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won’t. It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out, which we will be discussing in a just a few months’ time. I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package. They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression. They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy. They are on the streets and there is violence, and frankly this can only get worse. You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy. What good Europeans, really good Europeans, would do, is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency, to allow them to devalue, to let them renegotiate their debts, because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return. Then, and only then, can real austerity packages work. Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts. If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, the United Kingdom went through this exactly twenty years ago. We were part of the exchange rate mechanism. We were trapped, trying to peg ourselves against the Deutschmark with interest rates that were double what they should have been. It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily. Mercifully we crashed out of exchange rate mechanism, interest rates came down and we had a happy time during the 1990s. You cannot fuse together different economies with different rates of growth and with different patterns of trade across the world. We learned our lesson. We did not join the euro, thank God. Those who did are, I am afraid, currently trapped inside an economic prison. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro. Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out, you have come back and said, oh no, they don’t, everything is fine. And now we face the fourth bail-out – the second Greek bail-out – unless, of course, today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either. But the question I want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in Greece or Ireland or Portugal to date. It is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks, and which concerns the integrity of the European Central Bank itself. Month after month, I have warned that you cannot go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt. Mr Barroso, do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Backing up some of my rhetoric, just yesterday, the respected think-tank, Open Europe, came out with some figures on this. It said that a staggering EUR 190 billion of the ECB’s exposure is exposure to the Greek state and Greek banks. Should the ECB see the value of its assets fall by just 4.25%, its entire capital base will be wiped out. Do you accept the findings of Open Europe, or do you go along with Mr Juncker’s assertion a couple of weeks ago that, with the situation in the euro being as serious as it is, you actually have to lie in public? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to say to Commissioner Rehn that I have been looking at the IMF Charter. There is nothing here that will surprise you; it is there to promote balance, growth, exchange rate stability, to lessen disequilibrium and to help countries that are in trouble. The classic method uses is to shore up the finances and organise a competitive devaluation. Nowhere in here does it say that the IMF is there to support political experiments and, in so many ways, that is what Dominique Strauss-Kahn did. He used the IMF to help bail out the failing euro project and, as such, he was a very poor choice of candidate. Now you want to compound that by approving Christine Lagarde – another member of the European political elite, another euro fanatic, somebody else who believes in propping up this euro project – and I would have thought that, as she has got a vested interest, she is, in fact, a highly unsuitable candidate. It is as if the EU has hijacked the IMF, that it is now there as part of the support mechanism for the euro, so that it is not just the taxpayers of the eurozone and the non-eurozone EU members, but the whole world that now has to help prop up the euro as the Greek problem compounds by the day. Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question. I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well. I would have thought this is a very poor choice. The international community at some point will tell you where to get off – perhaps not just quite yet. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, yesterday indeed was Europe Day and in the courtyard here we had armed soldiers, we had the Luftwaffe band and imperial eagles, we had the flag being paraded, being raised, the European anthem; it was the display of militarism and EU nationalism. I thought and hoped it was all just a bad dream, but today we have got you, Mr Barroso. You begin of course by reiterating the fact that the free movement of peoples is the embodiment of the European project. You then go on to say that it is the duty of Member States to share the burdens of migratory flows into Europe. You advocate a common EU immigration policy, but of course you know that you are losing because the row that has blown up between Italy and France shows that when there is a crisis, between the theory of European integration and the practicality of nation state, it is the nation state that wins. So you are worried that you are losing and, in your defence of your position, in your defence of your beloved acquis communautaire, your body of law, you resort to intolerance, you resort to nationalism, you make me realise that what I saw yesterday was actually for real. You attack those who want to control their own border policies. You attack them today as xenophobes. You attack them as extremists, but worst of all, oh worst of all, you attack them three times for being populists. Is that not a dreadful thing? The power of the ballot box. When people dare to vote no in referendums, they are populists; when they want to control their own borders, they are populists. I put it to you that populists are actually democrats and you abuse those who want to fly the flag of populism. Well, here it is, Mr Barroso. Here it is. (Mr Farage, Mr Agnew and Mr Bloom held up small Union Jacks)
 That flag has represented liberal democracy far more than any other Member State of this European Union and it will go on long after your star-spangled banner has disappeared. Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, under Rule 110 of our Rules of Procedure, the Commission may, at any time, request permission to make a statement on an urgent issue. Overnight, we have had the economically calamitous, but unsurprising, news that another country has bitten the dust and that Portugal is going to have to be bailed out. Can I ask whether you have received any request from the Commission to make a statement on Portugal today? If not, would the Commissioner say why not? Does he think that the bailing-out of Portugal is not important enough for this Parliament to discuss, or is he just burying his head in the sand? Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, I ask: is the answer yes or no? Have you received a request from the Commission to make an urgent statement on the Portuguese situation or not? John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

in writing. 
– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others. Therefore, UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments, but voted a resounding ‘No’ to the report as a whole. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr Barroso, I am confused. Help me. What is the EU’s policy on Libya? I got a letter on 1 April from the noble Baroness Ashton telling me that the EU had provided more than EUR 75 million in humanitarian assistance and that, although the situation remains uncertain, the EU has offered to assist in fostering dialogue. Yet she wrote this many days after the bombing had begun. That is what she has been saying. On the other hand, we have got hard man Herman Van Rompuy, who has made it clear that regime change is the aim of this Libyan adventure. He also said that the action in Libya could not have happened without the European Union, and that France and Germany could not have taken military action without first getting the support of the European Council. So we have two big chiefs within the European Union directly contradicting each other. Could you please shed some light on the matter, and tell us what is the European Union’s policy on Gaddafi and Libya? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Well there is certainly a broad range of opinions here. I wonder whether Mr Barroso would agree with me that appointing as Head of your new Foreign Office and in charge of external security a woman who has been an extreme left-wing, life-long passivist, the former treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, somebody who has proved to be incompetent in the job, was not in fact one of the better decisions of the European Union. I can only say thank God for Baroness Ashton, without her I suspect all of us would be very much deeper into Libya. Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report threatens with the prejudice a reduction of the budget would have on European solidarity and economic development. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso’s view of the world today, but it was perhaps rather more ironic than he had intended. He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere, saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy. I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then, if you do not like what they do, you can get rid of them, turf them out and put somebody else in. It was ironic because his next sentence was ‘and that is why in Europe, facing the euro crisis, we must reinforce the Community method’. For the public watching in on this – which increasingly they do – the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats – people like you, Mr Barroso. I know the European Parliament voted for you, but you were the only candidate that was offered to us. That is not democracy! So Mr Barroso is saying, on the one hand, that democracy is good, but on the other hand, that we cannot have it in Europe. That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt, who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished – well, perhaps his own will be very shortly. He is saying that we want an economic union. Nobody has voted for that. Nobody has been asked whether they want it. He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it. What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal. After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland, it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message – ‘Come in number 3, your time is up’. Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6% on Monday. Mr Barroso knows that himself. It was when yields reached 7% that Ireland had to be bailed out. In April, we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt – another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over. Let us remind ourselves that, in the last six months, 80% of Portugal’s debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank. We cannot go on as a European Union buying our own debt. If we do, the next debt crisis will not be in a country, but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, I am pleased that Mr Schulz has asked me that. The difficulty is that when you form an artificial state that has within it more than one language group – which is clearly the case in Belgium – you may, for a period of time, be able to hold it together, but whether it is Belgium, whether it is Yugoslavia or whether it is the European Union, if you have entirely different languages and cultures, it will not hold together. The reason you are so upset about Belgium, and Mr Van Rompuy got terribly upset about it and Mr Verhofstadt never likes it, is that – is this not the truth, Mr Schulz? – Belgium is a microcosm for the whole European project. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, that is a good question. Mr Schulz, you are quite right that Belgium was a British invention, and a British mistake. We have made many over the years. We have got some things right and some things wrong, just as your country, Germany, has. Germany’s history has not been whiter than white, I think you might agree. You are quite right. Actually, holding together the United Kingdom has been something that has been deeply troubling. Indeed, Ireland went its own way, back in 1921, I think, when independence for Ireland was established. You are right. It is very difficult to hold together different cultures. I do think that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland works, at the moment, because it has consent. If it did not have consent, then there would be popular calls for referenda and those nations would be able to break away. But my point is that in this European Union, nobody is being given that opportunity. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the theory of a Tobin tax has been around for years – the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange – but, of course, it has never seen the light of day. What is being proposed here – and, of course, it is because the European Union is so desperate for money and is in so much trouble that it needs its own resources – is to use an opportunity to bash the financial sector because they are very unpopular at the moment and to introduce a financial transaction tax just in the European Union, as if somehow that will gain us great revenue. I am sorry, but we are living in a global economy. If we become uncompetitive through tax or regulation, people simply move – and they can do so in the space of 24 hours. To do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics. The biggest foreign exchange market in the world – the biggest financial sector in the world – is in London. If I did not know better, I would think perhaps there was a plot afoot here to stop the Anglo-Saxons going on doing all of their business. In 2010, as a result of the AIFM Directive, one in four hedge funds left the City of London. If we continue down this route, Britain will have lost its biggest single industry. I think the time has come when the City of London and Britain’s financial markets are going to rise up against membership of this European Union. Maybe, if we vote for this tomorrow, it will be so bad that it will be really rather a good thing for UKIP and our view that we should not be part of this massive socialist experiment.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service. The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK. We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception.

– Mr President, what is the most commonly used word in association with the euro? No, it is not ‘failure’ – although it could be. It is ‘stability’, is it not? A decade ago, everybody said that once we had the euro currency, it would bring us stability. Well, a decade on, I would suggest that what it has brought is chaos, discord and misery for millions, and yet the word ‘stability’ is still being used this morning. Mr Barroso used it, Mr Van Rompuy used it: ‘stability’. In fact, we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in Portugal went well last week, whereas the reality is that the European Central Bank was actually using taxpayers’ money to buy their own debt. Your reassurances that all is well do not work. Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Van Rompuy? Bond yields in Portugal rose to nearly 7% yesterday. The public right across the Union no longer supports the currency, and the battle for Spain has not even begun. The model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail-out fund. You even want to increase the scope of the bail-out fund so that, along with the ECB, you, too, can go on buying yet more of your own debt. You are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union. If you succeed, then we should change the name: get rid of ‘European Union’ and call it the ‘Debt Union’. If you do succeed, you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison, in which people’s suffering will be untold, while the northern countries will find themselves paying, forever, a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies. We have reached a point where it actually does not matter what any of you say. Nobody believes you. The public does not support you. I hope and pray the markets break you. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I did say a decade ago that you could not have Greece and Germany put together in the same monetary union and that it would not work. If you go back through history, you find that when people are put together in false currency unions, when governments think they know better than the markets, governments always lose. You ask me what my solution is today. It is absolutely as plain as a pikestaff. Greece, Portugal and Ireland do not fit inside the euro. What we should be doing, what Mr Van Rompuy should be doing in order to give real leadership, is to be introducing a plan B and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency, to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance, because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I welcome Mr Orbán. After the six months’ farce of the Belgian Presidency, it is nice to see an elected Prime Minister from a proper country. How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology – and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union. Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically, you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union. In fact, you are going to meet lots of Communists over the next six months, including the boss of the Commission here, old Barroso who was an advocate of Chairman Mao! You will see centralised economic planning and control and, above all, what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of Europe without their consent. Wake up Mr Orbán. Look at how they are trying to bully you this morning. They are trying to tell you how to run your own country. Tell them where to go. Stand up and fight for democracy once again. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, 2010 will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in Europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders. So here we have another summit, another crisis, confidence in the euro ebbing by the week. It is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism. You think that, if you have a fund of say a billion euros, all will be well. Well it will not be well. The failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation. It is nothing to do with the markets, be they currency or bonds, it is because the North and the South in Europe cannot today, or at any point, be put together in a single monetary union. It will not work. And politically, of course, you have to change the treaty. The reason being that the four German professors will win at Karlsruhe and prove that the bail-outs you have put in place already were in fact illegal under the treaties. Well, in many ways I welcome this treaty change because it will mean that there has to be a referendum in Ireland. And you never know, David Cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the United Kingdom. I am sure that, as democrats, you would all welcome a referendum on the EU in the United Kingdom. We should also reflect at the end of 2010 not just on the state of the Union, but on the state of Belgium. For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply. What a farce this is. You have not had a government in your own country since June. Here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation. It truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial. Belgium is a microcosm of the entire European Union. Belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow. Happy Christmas, everybody. David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, the recent WikiLeaks storm has led to mixed feelings, with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy. However, I was particularly amused by the references to you in WikiLeaks, where it mentioned your trip to Russia and the fact that you were ignored and excluded and the Russian view from upon high that you were nothing more than a glorified international civil servant. Mr Barroso, remember: we have discussed this before here. I have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy. Is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage, and why increasingly, the peoples of Europe are holding you and the entire Commission in contempt? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Well, Mr Barroso, I enjoyed that enormously! That you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept I have come across in my entire life. The fact is that the Commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging Europe’s economies in the way that it is. Are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of Europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues? (Interjections from the floor from various Members) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy has been in office for one year, and in that time the whole edifice is beginning to crumble. There is chaos. The money is running out. I should thank Mr Van Rompuy. He should perhaps be the pin-up boy of the Eurosceptic movement. But just look around this Chamber this morning, Mr Van Rompuy. Just look at these faces. Look at the fear. Look at the anger. Poor old Barroso here looks like he has seen a ghost. You know, they are beginning to understand that the game is up and yet, in their desperation to preserve their dream, they want to remove any remaining traces of democracy from the system. It is pretty clear that none of you have learned anything. When you yourself, Mr Van Rompuy, say that the euro has brought us stability, I suppose I could applaud you for having a sense of humour. But is this not really just the bunker mentality? Your fanaticism is out in the open. You talked about the fact that it was a lie to believe that the nation state could exist in the 21st
-century globalised world. Well, that may be true in the case of Belgium – which has not had a government for six months – but for the rest of us, right across every Member State in this Union (and perhaps this is why we see the fear in the faces), people are increasingly saying: ‘We don’t want that flag, we don’t want the anthem, we don’t want this political class, we want the whole thing consigned to the dustbin of history’. We had the Greek tragedy earlier on this year, and now we have the situation in Ireland. I know that the stupidity and greed of Irish politicians has a lot to do with this. They should never have joined the euro. They suffered with low interest rates, a false boom and a massive bust. But look at your response to them. What they are being told, as their government is collapsing, is that it would be inappropriate for them to have a general election. In fact, Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget first before they would be allowed to have a general election. Just who the hell do you people think you are? You are very dangerous people indeed. Your obsession with creating this euro-state means that you are happy to destroy democracy. You appear to be happy for millions of people to be unemployed and to be poor. Untold millions must suffer so that your euro-dream can continue. Well it will not work, because it is Portugal next. With their debt levels of 325% of GDP, they are the next ones on the list. After that, I suspect it will be Spain. The bailout for Spain would be seven times the size of Ireland’s, and at that moment, all the bailout money will have gone. There will not be any more. But it is even more serious than economics, because if you rob people of their identity, if you rob them of their democracy, then all they are left with is nationalism and violence. I can only hope and pray that the euro project is destroyed by the markets before that really happens.David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, I was prevented from speaking earlier. One of the claimed benefits of EU membership is free movement of peoples, and the EU is quick to condemn Switzerland’s democratic referendum results. So why were seven qualified British ski instructors, legally working in France, treated like criminals, thrown into freezing cells and now facing three months in jail when they have every right to work there? Should this Parliament not demand their immediate release, and – I must be careful how I say this – is this ‘piste war’ not totally in breach of EU rules?

 Mr President, I happen to have been at the United Nations and Security Council yesterday, in snowy New York. I support this UN multilateral treaty on controlling conventional arms sales both in general terms and because it has been signed by the UK.  It is vital here to stress the difference between the United Nations, which is intergovernmental – i.e. agreements are made between the governments of 193 individual nations, 154 of which have signed this agreement – and the European Union, which is supra- or trans-national – i.e. it cuts above or across nation states. I do not agree with that approach. Indeed, the official UN brochure I have here says that the UN is not a super-state, nor is it a world government. The states members of the UN remain sovereign and equal and have no intention of delegating this sovereignty to any supra-national entity. The point is that, as long as this report does acknowledge decision-making is done at national state level, then it is an advance. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

I made the decision to vote against this report as I do not agree in principle with a new EU action for the European Capitals of Culture, which it has seized from the Council of Europe. This is the European Union promoting a shared European cultural identity which I see as undermining the identities of Member States. I do not see the European Capitals of Culture as a valid use of time and funding and it will be even more of a detriment if used as a political and ideological tool to foist a non-existent cultural brand on Member States. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Madam President, all of us here value and support human rights, but people are deeply concerned about excessive rights for criminals, murderers and terrorists. The European Court of Human Rights, across the water over here, wants the UK to give the vote to prisoners, and in the EU we have the Fundamental Charter of Human Rights, under Lisbon, and the havoc caused in trade deals as a result of it.   At the same time, the EU is supporting Edward Snowden, who is a traitor in the US. And in this report we have the European instrument for democracy and human rights. It has a budget of over a billion euros and what is it doing? Well, it spent USD 2.6 million in the USA to oppose the death penalty. That is a matter for America, not the EU. The EU must stop trying to run the world when it cannot even get its own accounts signed off. I oppose yet more EU waste. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, I voted against this report as it is a gross intervention in national affairs and national sovereignty. There may indeed be rights abuses in Hungary, but it is for the Hungarian people to address these concerns and not the EU. This is how the EU works: it takes a good cause such as this and it makes it its business, but it is not the EU’s business. This idea of a wise men group, an investigative body of MEPs looking into the rights of all 28 Member States – we are not just talking about Hungary in this report – takes away our democratic rights; it does not add to those rights.  I think this proposal crosses the Rubicon and, just as when Julius Caesar crossed that Rubicon, there is no way back. It marks the start of a European empire interfering in nation states’ matters. And as Julius Caesar said, the die is indeed cast. I think this report absolutely says that. We must go against this. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Mr President, I know that Mr Duff is commendably honest and direct about being an arch-federalist – a true believer in the European superstate. That is something that five million people in the East of England have no desire for at all, and it is noticeable that his party, the Lib Dems, is not supporting a democratic ‘in/out’ referendum vote this Friday in Westminster.  However, this report is outrageous even in federalist terms. It advocates that European political parties should stand in British elections, complete with their own emblems and their own political broadcasts on TV. I believe that the EPP here is already busy raising GBP 5 million to spend on the forthcoming election. The report is in favour of European political parties nominating candidates like Mr Barroso for the post of President of the European Commission. I think this is a false and worthless measure, a sort of GDR-style democracy. The report also advocates extending candidacy to EU citizens … (The President cut off the speaker) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Mr President, these proposals have created great concern in my constituency in the east of England. They cover powered two- and three-wheelers, light trailers, tractors and older cars. It does seem to be a case of just trying to harmonise because of a political super-state, rather than because of any real need, value or urgency. If you take motorcycles in particular, EU studies actually find that less than 1% of motorcycle crashes are directly caused by defects, so this proposal really is not needed. Parliament’s own Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have rejected these proposals. I feel that this proposal is completely disproportionate to any problems it claims to solve. It goes against subsidiarity, which should enable national measures for national road safety priorities, and it really does seem to be another case of looking for a solution to a problem that does not exist, and merely increases cost and bureaucracy. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Madam President, I welcome the limited reforms passed today. All credit should go to Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall for his sterling efforts on this issue, and also to the ECR group. I fear, however, that this is still rather like spraying perfume on a long-dead fish: the bad odour lingers. The common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a disaster. Not only has it failed to secure fish stocks, but it has also failed to help the employment situation in fishing, around the UK and around Europe. The fishing community in the east of England has been devastated by the CFP. And the issue of discards in particular, the fact that good, perfectly edible fish – up to 90% of them in some areas – are dumped back in the sea, is a complete disgrace. Given that Norway and Iceland have not had a policy of discards, and call such a policy criminal, why has it taken the EU so long to follow them? Provisions such as Amendment 119, which I voted against today, seeking to allow discards, are still a disgrace. The problem continues. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, this proposal is the thin end of a giant EU wedge. It is an attempt to introduce harmonised EU taxation and a common tax regime for the EU. It is intended to save the euro zone, but it is a bit like a drowning man pulling others down with him. While it only applies to eleven countries now, it will be expanded. You can see that happening. The City of London, as one of the largest financial centres in the world, will be its aim. Therefore, I vigorously oppose this proposal. The Dutch Finance Minister called it catastrophic, and the Swedish Finance Minister called it a very dangerous thing. This is a disastrous proposal and I voted to veto it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, the people of my country are very concerned at paying yet more money to the EU. We are paying GBP 53 million a day gross, which is GBP 30 million a day net. We are also talking now of GBP 118 billion a year in terms of red tape or regulations, and the accounts have still not been signed off for the EU for 18 years in a row.  This is not good enough – and now the EU wants one-and-a-half billion more this year and yet more for the next seven years. What planet is the EU living on? Is it Mars or Venus or Pluto? This is not real. What is real is that the people of Greece are suffering; the conditions in Greece now are worse than Germany in the 1930s because of the political euro. That is a disgrace, and here we are in Strasbourg – 200 million euros a year to come back and forward between Brussels and Strasbourg. This is a disgrace; we must cut back on the budget. Not a penny more till the EU gets its house in order. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, this resolution is completely unacceptable. It is the equivalent of sending EU tanks across national borders. There is no acceptable EU role in these vital, strategic and offence responsibilities, and no role for Commission legislation. Just look at the language. The EU ‘should be a global political player on the international scene’ it says, ‘to protect its
 interests in the world and to ensure the security of its
 citizens’. All under the roof of a single political authority. It says, the EU has ‘an important role to play as security provider for the Member States’ and it wants mergers of European businesses to contribute to European defence industry. Well, here is the real aim of this shameful BAE/EADS merger proposal. But worst of all, it wants to take the EU to war. It talks of having the ‘full range of possibilities for action on the international scene’, of intervening ‘in all types of crisis, including […] high intensity conflicts’ – and that means war. No, this resolution must be stopped in its tracks. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Madam President, I very much welcome Russia joining the WTO. I think the issue, though, is about whether Russia successfully adopts WTO procedures. What does joining the WTO actually mean in practice? The official commitments include non-discriminatory treatment of imports of goods and services, reducing tariffs and binding tariff levels, ensuring transparency when implementing trade measures, limiting agricultural subsidies, enforcing intellectual property rights and foregoing the use of local content requirements and other investment measures which limit imports. It also requires them to open government procurement contract opportunities to foreign firms and to accept that the WTO will settle trade dispute procedures. That is quite a long list for Russia to sign up to. It is quite a challenge for Russia. For example, Russia has export duties on no less than 450 types of products at the moment, and duties will be reduced from 19 % to an average of 8 %. Russia is still a tough place to do business. It is ranked 120 in the world ‘ease of doing business’ rankings, and Putin called the accession process to the WTO an ambush of Russian economic interests. So I very much welcome the move towards the WTO, but there are some tough challenges ahead. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have to say that I can scarcely believe these proposals. I feel that they are utter nonsense and it should worry democrats that two-thirds of MEPs supported this motion. I did not. How can we throw money away on such nonsense when the peoples of Europe are hurting? As they are in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in France and in my own country. The EU is clearly hopelessly out of touch with the people it purports to represent. At a time when Angela Merkel today is threatening to veto the entire budget summit if David Cameron vetoes anything but a freeze, this is crazy. David Cameron is trying to do the right thing. Are the peoples of Europe, in between paying higher taxes, in between job cuts and riots, turning to one another to say that what we really need is a Year of European Citizenship? No, absolutely not. Nor am I a citizen of the EU, but a loyal subject of the Queen. The idea is flawed, insulting and an utter waste of money. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against this report as I find the notion of a single European railway area a ridiculous, unnecessary and unwelcome intrusion into domestic affairs. There is no need for Fritz the Tank Engine or for a single EU Fat Controller for our railways. It is true that international, rather than regional, agreements are valuable for air and maritime transport, as are single market measures for rail suppliers. But the United Kingdom is a large island with only one rail connection with continental Europe and it has no road connections at all. So for road and rail, it does not work. I think this proposal does nothing but confuse priorities and drive up costs. In East Anglia, my constituency, hard-pressed rail users do not stand on platforms demanding a single European railway area. They need better services, less crowding and reasonable ticket prices. This is a silly single rail area proposal and it should not be allowed. It should not leave the station. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, the ACTA agreement is one I wish I could champion. I very much agree we need measures to counter piracy and protect intellectual property, which is vital to business, but I cannot support this ACTA. It is not acceptable in its current form. It is too catch-all. Whilst the thrust of the agreement is worthy, the devil is in the detail. In the detail, we find that Internet service providers will be forced to spy on all their customers, Chinese-state style, becoming legally responsible for pirated files. Search engines could be closed for aiding and abetting. In this ACTA, we have what I call ‘pre-crime’, as in the movie Minority Report
, where you can have your PCCs on the mere suspicion of infringement. You have a loose definition of commercial scale, which could see many law-abiding citizens prosecuted for very low-key usage. You have customs officers able to go through your files at airports, and we have this unaccountable ACTA committee which has the power to make changes without referring back to this Parliament or others. In conclusion, I support the aim but I do not support the detail of ACTA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

Blue-card answer. 
– I have read it in English so I do understand it. I have taken the trouble to go through this and so have my researchers. I think honestly you have to judge it on the legal detail in that agreement. That is what I have made my decision on, not on a lot of e-mails I have received – we have all received those – but on the actual detail and what it says in that agreement. I do not think, unfortunately, that that is acceptable. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted for this as I believe that trade, rather than aid, is a better way to assist less developed countries to prosper. However, I want to make a wider point about tariff reduction and trade agreements relevant to all of us. Here, we see preferential access to the EU single market being given to nations which are not members of the EU but which get reduced – or even zero – tariff walls from the EU customs union. Yet they do not have to sign up to financial contributions to the EU or to a whole body of law, the acquis
, and can trade pretty freely. It goes to show how far we have travelled from the 1970s world of high tariffs and menacing trade walls and how much has been achieved by the WTO and GATT in reducing barriers to trade around the world. We can all benefit from much looser trading relations and lower tariff walls. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report as it is another classic case of the right idea but in the wrong place. Of course we all want to see better human rights records around the world. I personally raised the issue of human rights with President Santos of Colombia last year and I was impressed with his commitment to improve human rights in a country which has suffered from 50 years of guerrilla warfare. But this is to confuse political agreements about political measures with trade agreements, which should be about jobs and market access. Trade agreements are not trade agreements when they become weighed down with non-trade issues. No matter how worthy those issues are, it is not desirable or effective to confuse the two, nor can you switch trade agreements on and off like light switches, as this report suggests, so that every accusation on human rights leads to the suspension of the agreement. That is a recipe for chaos, confusion and misery, for lost jobs and lost opportunities, and we cannot afford that, especially not at this time. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I have two questions to ask Baroness Ashton as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Firstly, I do not understand what the EU role is in this United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. Here is a very welcome agreement concluded by the intra-governmental United Nations with 193 nation states involved – only Zimbabwe voted against it – so nation states and the UN are at one. Why, then, do we need a supranational trespasser, in the form of the EU, to muscle in on the action? A second related question is what role does the European Defence Agency (EDA) have, given its arms export control policy? At least EDA, again, is international, not supranational. But why did it allegedly take you from 1 December 2009, when you were appointed as Head of the EDA, to January 2012 – two years – to actually visit its premises? It is only 15 minutes from your Brussels office. Is it actually so low priority? David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I am very much in favour of equal work for equal value and of fair treatment, but the issue here is: who enforces that? We do not need the EU to dictate to sovereign nations yet more top-down equalities legislation in yet another power grab. Pay should not be set at the EU level. With the state of the European economies at present, this enforcement really does not help – it is like tying weights to someone who is already drowning. Already the engine of our economies – small businesses – are suffering from too many unnecessary, costly and over-the-top regulations, such as the disgraceful, out-of-control UK employment tribunal system, where 90% of those laws come from the EU and which really acts as licensed blackmail. Thankfully, the UK Government is cutting that back. But business really does not need this – not when one in five young people in the EU are out of work and when the EU share of GDP wealth is falling so alarmingly. We have to ensure that all intervention is constructive; this is not. Then there is the EU’s Equality Directive, which was dressed up as Harriet Harman’s Equality Act. Civitas actually estimated that that directive alone cost GBP 150 million in the service sector and 210 million across SMEs, across the UK. It is too much. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Kolarska-Bobińska, no, absolutely not. I do compliment the report. As I said quite clearly, I am in favour of equal pay for equal work. That principle is very important. What I query is whether this should be done at EU level. I do not believe it should be; it should be for nation states. However, I absolutely agree with you on the principle. It is the intervention at EU level, the heavy costs of that and the power of the EU over sovereign states that I object to.

Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Morin-Chartier, I agree with that. I accept in this report that career breaks actually cause a lot of loss of income and affect this. As I say, I am very much in favour in the thrust of it. What I am saying is that this should be down to nation states to do and should not be enforced – which this legislation associated with a good report does. That is the problem. It is not the report, because that is a very good report in many respects. It is the legislation, done top-down from the EU, which I object to. The great thrust of it is very good, but it should be done through nation states. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the ECR Group. 
– Mr President, I am alarmed at the tendency of the European Union to trespass into areas of national sovereignty where it does not belong; this is another example of that trend. It is the rightful business of the Canadian Government – and not us – to decide who it lets into its country, and why. Canada is not discriminating against us Europeans: it introduced similar restrictions for Mexicans, even though Mexico is in the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada has successfully lifted the requirement for temporary visas where conditions are met. It has done so for Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Lithuania and Hungary. There seems to be serious confusion in the Commission’s stance in two regards. Firstly, there is confusion as to whether such visa matters belong in free trade agreements. They do not; just as ‘Mode 4’ worker access is not appropriate in the draft EU/India free trade agreement, so traveller visa matters do not belong in this Canadian free trade agreement. Border issues like this are a matter for Member States. The second point of confusion is about the European Union being a country. Yes, it aspires to be a country, but it is not one yet. So it is not the business of this place to force Canada to treat every EU nation equally, as if we were one country. That is a matter for individual nation states working through their own embassies. The Canadians have laid down fair and reasonable criteria, including low immigration violation rates, low asylum claims, high integrity of travel documents and good cooperation on removals. Those are reasonable terms. If this principle is breached, however, every EU Member State can expect the EU to start dictating all its border matters, and many EU Member States may well dislike losing control of their own borders to EU diktats. France and Spain have suspended Schengen on occasion, as has Spain this month, and the Dutch have tried to block Bulgaria and Romania. So in conclusion, Mr President, this is a line in the sand; a legal and political border that the EU must not cross. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Ms Parvanova, I think the point you are missing is that they are all nation states. The objection I have is to pretending that the EU is one country and saying that we are trying to force equality on Canada as if the EU were one country. By all means let the national embassies argue with the Canadian authorities and do it for themselves, but I do not think the EU should be acting this way, and certainly not within free trade agreements. I am on the Committee on International Trade, and too much leeway is being given to items which are not to do with trade and jobs. Europe desperately needs trade and jobs at this point. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– The answer is that, as part of being a member of the European Union, every member country, such as Britain, has to hand over the negotiation of free trade agreements to the EU. I personally think that Britain should be outside the European Union and negotiate its own free trade agreements, as do Norway and Switzerland – and we would get a better result. That is the reason that is driving it. I am in favour of trade and of helping Europe get better jobs – I think we all are here – but I think there are better ways of doing it. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because I do not believe that the EU should be involved in social security matters. I think it is trespassing on international responsibilities, and it seems to be a world away from the trade agreement that the EU is meant to be about. I am particularly concerned about one aspect. I was self-employed myself: I ran a consultancy. This report refers to paying unemployment benefits to the self-employed throughout the EU. This again is undermining our flexible economy. In Britain, when you are self-employed, you do things your own way and it gives people a lot of freedom. I think that is undermining this freedom. This report may be about technical matters but I am totally against it on principle. The EU should keep out of social security, pension and benefit matters. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I abstained on this report, not because I do not believe in human rights – I very much do – but because Conservative MEPs and I all feel that human rights are really about balance and getting the balance right. I have to say that my colleague who wrote this report, Richard Howitt, did not show much balance when he supported the rights of illegal travellers on illegal pitches at Dale Farm, whilst ignoring the rights of those local people who were so badly affected by them. That showed contempt for the rule of law. I am concerned that there is also a lack of balance in this report over things such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Just yesterday, the British Government acted – quite rightly – to arrest Abu Qatada, who is an alleged terrorist and a man who has actually praised the hijackers of 9/11, after eight years. It took eight years to do that because of human rights legislation. This report supports that move towards the EU Convention on Human Rights and EU support for it. So, let us get the balance right. Human rights are good, but if the balance is not correct, it weakens the whole case for them. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, at a time of economic difficulty across the world, and particularly in the eurozone, and with the EU budget itself under enormous pressure, I cannot see the justification for shelling out huge amounts of cash this way. The report talks of up to EUR 6 000 per head per refugee, and a minimum of EUR 4 000. Britain has a noble history of providing shelter to genuine asylum seekers and takes more than its fair share of the load, but these common EU priorities of ‘resettlement’ are unwelcome, unhelpful and unaffordable. That is why I voted against this fund. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report because it shows all so clearly that the British people were lied to about the true intention of the European Union project. It is about take-over, not about trade. This Vălean report wants harmonised tax, social security, state benefits, pensions, even divorce laws right across the EU. What is this to do with trade? What is this to do with the common market? It is about harmonising arrangements to create a single European state. Well, I am not an EU citizen and I will not be an EU citizen. I am a loyal subject of Her Majesty The Queen, in her 60th year of rule, and this Vălean report is an insult to that loyalty. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, I voted against Iceland joining the EU because I think, as two-thirds of Icelandic people thought in a poll just last month, that Iceland would be mad to join the EU. Mad because membership would destroy Iceland’s key industry – fishing – through the disastrous common fisheries policy, just as it has destroyed 100 000 jobs in the UK in fishing and nearly all the fishing in my own constituency of the East of England. Mad because they would have to join the disastrous euro as well and abandon the free floating króna, which has brought a boom in exports. Mad, too, because its economy would be weighed down with a barrage of EU red tape. Its growth rate is currently 3.1%, whereas the EU’s GDP forecast is 0 for this year. Why risk it? As for Icesave, there are other legal mechanisms outside the EU, such as the EFTA court, which has already ruled that Iceland must pay up. So we must stop kidding ourselves in the EU that Iceland wants to join. Iceland’s sane option, as I believe Britain’s is too, is to stay proud, independent and self-governing. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I voted against EU stability bonds, or Eurobonds, as they fail to address the central problem: the euro itself. It is clear the euro is a dangerous and failed construct, and no political posturing or economic gesturing gets us away from the basic truth that the euro is disastrous for the world economy. The sooner troubled nations like Greece devalue and default, the better. The cure is now more dangerous and deadly than the malady. Is there no end to these desperate measures to prop up this political currency? The trampling of democracy in Greece, Italy and elsewhere by the EU’s new inner politburo, the Frankfurt Group, so that Europe erupts in flames. Barroso and Van Rompuy going cap in hand to China for rescue funds – and at what price? Gerrymandering Lagarde into the IMF so the IMF is misused as a new euro bailout fund. Weimar-like plans to print EUR 2 trillion to buy rubbish bonds; new wheelbarrows to carry all the notes. For God’s sake, for all our sakes, let the euro go. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
).  
– Madam President, I voted against this report. Whilst I salute what David Cameron did for defending vital national interests over the rules at the recent summit, actually the purpose of it was to put in place a financial plan to save the euro and it failed to do that. In my view, what is much more scary than the full or partial collapse of the euro – damaging as that would be – is the notion of the European Central Bank printing EUR 2 trillion or more with nothing to back the paper they are printing. I think Angela Merkel is right, but she has been isolated on this because she wants to avoid the nightmare scenario, quite rightly, of a return to the Weimar Republic. In my view, it is better for an orderly end to the euro, or parts of the euro, than wheelbarrows full of worthless notes. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). 
 – Mr President, this vote reflects on the similarities and differences between the United States of America and the aspirate United States of Europe, or USE. The US is democratic, free-trading, entrepreneurial and capitalist; the USE is corporatist, protectionist, statist and interventionist. The US are states of a federal country with one prevailing culture and speaking one language; the USE is made up of nation states, very different to just states, and has a multitude of cultures and languages. The US has the dollar, a single currency that is still strong despite a debt of USD 12 trillion. The USE has a single currency on the point of collapse. And when Americans have frequent referenda and elect even insurance commissioners and registers of deeds; the USE puts Soviet-style placemen, little Honeckers at the head of its nation states. This statement may accentuate the similarities, but in truth, the differences are plain to see. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I am deeply unimpressed with this idea of a European Heritage Label ‘to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the EU’. Once again, we seem to have a scary 1984-style rewriting of history, just like the wasteful Museum of European History, where no-one can agree when this history is due to start and where, of course, no-one can mention the war. This is an Orwellian exercise that seeks to term World Wars as mere European civil wars, with the realities obscured in a haze of half-truths. In Brussels last week a French lady insulted my red Remembrance Day poppy as ‘out of date’. I find it disgusting that a symbol of the huge sacrifice that has guaranteed all our freedoms should be treated with such contempt. That poppy commemorates, too, the British soldier who died just last week in Afghanistan. History may be inconvenient and painful but, by God, you get into far more trouble seeking to deny its realities. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I speak as someone with a railway industry background. I worked for Britain’s passenger railways, the Channel Tunnel high-speed rail link, and as a ministerial adviser. Whilst I support the concept of a British-style model of liberalised rail services, which has given the UK the fastest-growing railways in Europe, of track charges, of open access, of train leasing and of a strong and independent rail regulator, I simply do not see this as anything to do with the European Union. Britain has 10 000 miles of rail lines and only one line is connected to Europe. Continental-gauge trains would not even fit on our lines in Britain. They would demolish our bridges and tunnels with their bulk. So I am sorry, but this idea of a single European railway area is a nonsense. It is unnecessary, undesirable and excessive interference in the responsibilities of national governments, so I do not support this report. In short, will the EU please keep off our tracks!

 My hobby is writing film scripts so I declare an interest in this subject. But whilst this report might claim to be about new ‘Cinema Paradiso’s, it is more likely to lead to ‘Cinema Disastroso’. Why does the EU want to discriminate against non-European films? Firstly, this is a form of non-tariff barrier and against WTO rules. Second, filmmaking is incredibly international these days – defining a non-European film is difficult: is Harry Potter or James Bond an American film for its production, finance and distribution, or British by dint of talent, theme, location and studios used? The ‘Fifth Element’ may be directed by Frenchman Luc Besson but Bruce Willis is the star. Even the iconic French film ‘Chocolat’ had substantial US support. Third, you simply cannot force people to watch films they do not want to see. European movies can be winners without giving away seats: ‘Chocolat’ took USD 71 million at the box office, ‘Amélie’ USD 152 million and “The King’s Speech” USD 386 million. Any support for film is better targeted on developing good stories or in skills development, not in seeking to prop up films no one wants to see. That is why on principle I could not vote for this report, whilst being very much in support of the film industry. David Campbell Bannermann  (ECR
).  
– Mr President, I am a friend of Israel but I am a critical friend of Israel. I myself worked with the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process and it is illusory to believe in a military solution; it has to be a political solution, and that involves negotiation. Legal settlements do not help that process. I do feel for the Palestinian people who have been very badly treated; I do believe that they need a state living in peace with Israel, side by side. However, I am not sure that this measure – which is a good negotiating tactic – of going straight to the UN to create a state is the right way forward, so I abstained on this vote. However, I do wish that the peace process moves forward. I think that is essential. But only painstaking negotiation, as we saw in the Northern Ireland peace process, can bring a political solution of benefit to everyone. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

 Mr President, many people have no idea how much national legislation emanates from the European Union. In the UK, it is estimated that there are now 100 000 laws, regulations, directives and decisions which come from the EU and have been imposed on the country. It is estimated that this collective legal burden, known as corpus juris
, costs between 4% and 10% of annual wealth in Britain. It is also estimated that the cost of such over-regulation is EUR 600 billion a year across the EU, and GBP 118 billion within the UK. Surely it is time to turn off this legislative sausage machine. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, I commend my colleague, Sajjad Karim, on a sensible report that takes us back in the right direction. The emphasis on subsidiarity is correct. 90% of the British economy has nothing to do with trade with the EU, and 80% of that economy is trade within the UK, but we have to apply all of these EU laws – 100 000 of them. On better legislation, the Agency Workers Directive, which will shortly be coming into force, is a disaster for Britain because, in the UK, we have a far more flexible workforce, which is vital to our prosperity and to our recovery. The question is why, when 80% of agency workers are in the UK, the EU should have any role in this legislation at all. The same is true of the dreadful Fund Managers Directive, where again 80% of fund managers are only in the UK. The lesson is this: overregulation destroys jobs, and we need less regulation now. David Campbell Bannerman  (ECR

– Mr President, I may have changed my seat here to the ECR Group this week, but I have not changed my perspective on the European Union. When it comes to Schengen, it has been the ECR view that this is generally a matter for Schengen area members to decide, including Switzerland, of course, which is in Schengen, but not in the European Union. But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis. Pragmatism dictates that the implications of Bulgaria and Romania joining are profound for those way beyond the Schengen area. A leaky border will mean that many illegal entrants destined for the UK can reach Calais without hindrance, for example, and Bulgaria has not complied with its obligations on organised crime. In summary, this proposal is simply a border too far. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, Europe Day this week was supposed to be a celebration of European national identity. It is not. It marks the ongoing replacement of European nation states with an EU supranational government, meaning above nation states. This is in contrast to intergovernmental, where nation states freely cooperate, but do not cede powers to a higher central authority. The Libyan no-fly zone illustrates the difference. The intergovernmental United Nations agreed a no-fly zone pioneered by nation states such as Britain, France and the United States, whilst nation states such as Germany and Russia abstained for their own valid reasons. The intergovernmental NATO is now conducting that operation through voluntary participation. In contrast, the supranational EU vigorously opposed David Cameron’s proposal for a no-fly zone. It is ironic that the Red Baroness herself, Cathy Ashton, stood against this no-fly proposal, her aide reportedly calling it ‘headline grabbing desperation’. The lesson of this is that principal nations act intergovernmentally while supranational bodies merely fiddle as Libya burns.

– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others.

– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

– Mr President, in Britain, the first day of April is called April Fool’s Day and people take great delight in fooling one another. So when some report that Iceland is on course to join the EU next year, I think: ‘April Fool!’ In reality, a survey has shown that 64% of Icelanders want to remain independent, only 24% want to carry on applying for EU membership and, indeed, 60% of Icelandic businesses are against it. It is also said that Iceland wants the security of the euro. April Fool! Even Portugal’s own banks are currently refusing to buy Portuguese bonds. Iceland will neither give up its rich fishing grounds – producing 40% of its exports – to join the disastrous common fisheries policy, nor abandon an Icelandic Parliament that is more than 1 000 years old and the winner of a UNESCO award for democracy. Even with a banking hangover, Iceland, like Britain, remains better off outside. No fooling there! David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, whilst good Libyan people are being bombed and terrorised by Mr Gaddafi, the EU has been shelling out on projects for Libya like ‘enhancing respect for international humanitarian law’. It is pretty obvious that has not worked. Meanwhile, Baroness Ashton here is demanding yet more resources, on top of the almost EUR 3 billion the External Action Service is due to receive. Instead of being immersed further in this bloated, duplicating and insatiable EU foreign service and European Defence Agency, Britain should spend the GBP 48 million a day we pay for EU membership on our own national defence interests. The Libyan crisis has shown the value of having aircraft carriers with fast jets stationed off crisis zones. I appeal to David Cameron to see sense and reprieve both the carrier HMS Ark Royal, and at least a minimum number of Harriers. During the Falklands crisis, Mrs Thatcher successfully reprieved the Ark’s sister ship, HMS Invincible. We must do the same for the Ark Royal. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

 UKIP wants the UK to leave the European Union and retain friendly trading links through a UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, similar to that with non-EU Switzerland and Norway. I voted in favour of this EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement as it can be a model and a template for a future UK-EU Free Trade Agreement, and because it demonstrates that tariff-free and favourable trading access to the EU can be achieved without the UK (or South Korea) being a member of the EU. This is especially true in the case of the UK, which would be the EU’s largest single trading partner. A UK-EU Free Trade Agreement would be likely merely to replicate existing trading arrangements with the UK as a member of the EU, and would therefore require far less negotiation (e.g. over tariff reductions) than did the agreement with South Korea.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service.

 Madam President, this banana is the stuff of war – an EU-inspired trade war with America that has lasted 16 years and has now been lost spectacularly. The EU has now been fined nearly USD 200 million by the World Trade Organisation and been forced to drop its illegal tariffs – all because of the protectionism that lies at the heart of the EU, in this case protection of French colonies. May I say that this very banana which I bought today in the European Parliament supermarket is illegal! It does not conform to EU rules in terms of the length, the width and the straightness of bananas. What is going on? With such barmy protectionism and such silly rules as this, one has to ask: is the European Union crazy or has it merely gone bananas? David Campbell Bannerman,

 – Madam President, in discussing the Black Sea area, one word leaps to mind, and that is ‘caution’. All must tread carefully here. The Black Sea area is Russia’s backyard. It has its fleet anchored in the Crimea at Sebastopol, close to the bloody battlefields of the Crimean War. We have seen the unfortunate conflict in Georgia, where there was fault on both sides. Had Georgia been in NATO, the consequences could have been disastrous. Whilst I support Georgian independence, it is unwise to goad the Russian bear in its own lair. Then there is Turkey which the EU is playing with by offering membership despite the reality that members such as France will veto an application. Turkey has just 4% of its landmass within Europe. It should not be in the EU. There are real dangers in leading Turkey on. Disappointment could drive Turkey into the hands of Islamic extremists. Finally, underlying all of this is the fact that the Black Sea is the hub for vital Caspian oil and gas. Tread carefully indeed. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, back in 2007, President Sarkozy denied any link between the release of five Bulgarian nurses from Libya and the Libyan order for French missiles worth EUR 240 million. These arms were sold to a country held responsible for the Lockerbie bombing and the supply of terrorist weapons. Yet even Gaddafi’s son suggested that there was a link between the two deals. It was arms for prisoners. In 2004, the EU removed the arms embargo against Libya in exchange for migration controls. That was arms for borders. Now, the London Times reports that Baroness Ashton suddenly wants to drop the EU arms embargo against China, which was imposed because of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, saying it is ‘a major impediment to developing stronger EU-China cooperation’. Actually, I believe it is a major impediment to saving the euro, is it not? Just like the Libyan deal, it seems the EU is so desperate now to save the euro that it is prepared to risk our collective security, as only the Chinese have enough money to rescue the euro. This is arms for bonds. Chinese foreign exchange reserves are USD 2.9 trillion. It has already bought Greek, Spanish and Portuguese bonds. However, China is also the country that bans the word ‘democracy’ from its search engines and executes thousands every year. So, I ask in all sincerity, just how low will the EU go to save the euro?

 Madam President, whilst we all unite in condemning flagrant human rights abuses in countries such as Iran and China, we must start distinguishing these from the grossly over-the-top EU-inspired human rights industry. The public are now bamboozled by this human rights fest. There is the EU Fundamental Charter of Human Rights in the Treaty of Lisbon; there is a European Court of Human Rights over there, which seeks to give British prisoners the vote – even murderers and paedophiles. There are excessive EU employment rights and American-style rights too for damages, and national legislation such as the UK’s disastrous Human Rights Act, which allows foreign terrorists and criminals to stay in Britain because their rights are now seen to be more important than those of the decent citizens they threaten. The truth is the noble cause of human rights has too often descended into a deep trough, with millionaire lawyers growing rich defending the spurious rights of terrorists, criminals and the greedy. This has to stop. David Campbell Bannerman,

 Madam President, thank you for using my full name. I think we should celebrate the fact that NATO’s Lisbon Summit has strengthened protection for our peace and democracy, in direct contrast to the Treaty of Lisbon which is already doing quite the opposite. But NATO is threatened by the savage cuts being imposed on European armed forces. These are deeply dangerous. It is unforgiveable that the UK Government is slashing spending to below the 2% base level every NATO member is meant to honour. It is a false economy too, because defence spending brings good jobs. Today the British Harrier jet is removed from service. This month we lost the carrier HMS Ark Royal prematurely with the loss of 6 000 dedicated personnel. The USA cannot be expected to carry this burden with less and less contribution from us. We should be under no illusion that the Americans could pull out of NATO, as top British General Dannatt has warned, and leave us to an emboldened Russian bear still prepared to launch cyber attacks against Estonia and to systematically probe British sea and air defences, in disturbing echoes of the Cold War.

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, I know Ukraine from visits to Kiev and the Crimea and collect Ukrainian artists such as Tetenko and Shishko. The Ukrainians are a good, generous, warm-hearted people, but politically I would counsel great care. Ukraine is a country divided between a pro-western west and a Russian-facing east. It is also a big player, with 45 million citizens, and Russia sees the country as very much in its backyard. I have toured the Russian fleet in Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula. The Russians will jealously guard access to the Black Sea from there. Any talk of Ukraine joining NATO would be a sharp kick to the Russian Bear. A clumsy diplomatic approach by Baroness Ashton could exacerbate tensions at a difficult time, whilst the cost of forcing Ukraine into the EU in terms of farming subsidies, regional aid and mass migration would be prohibitive.

 UKIP accepts there are legitimate arguments about the death penalty, both for and against. However, UKIP feels that the decision to have or not have the death penalty is a decision that lies only with the individual nation state, and not the undemocratic EU. UKIP notes the attempts the EU has made to interfere with other countries’ policies in this area. It is not for the EU to bully any country into maintaining abolition or enacting abolition of the death penalty. UKIP also notes the way the EU has shut down any debate on this topic in the European context, despite public opinion on the subject. The maintenance or otherwise of the death penalty is, and should remain, a decision solely made at the nation state level via democratic means. Any state with the death penalty should ensure proper procedures of evidence collection, prisoner interrogation and fair trials.

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the EU’s interest in the export of arms is clearly part of the increasing militarisation of the EU in the post-Lisbon era. Tony Blair himself told journalists just days ago that he wanted to see the EU develop a ‘military character’. A big part of this will be who the EU gets its weapons from and who it sells those weapons to. There is already talk that equipment produced for the EU army will not be interoperable with American equipment. The crazy notion of the British sharing an aircraft carrier with France would lose Britain access to US stealth technology overnight. It would also close the UK market to American imports and close the US market to British exports, destroying jobs on either side of the Atlantic. Defence exports are worth GBP 7 billion a year to the UK economy, that is the same as we pay to the EU in net contributions every year. We should oppose all such moves. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, there is something much deeper and more significant about the External Action Service, which is rooted in international law about what constitutes a nation state. Under the guiding 1933 Montevideo Convention, which the EU has accepted, there are four separate qualifications for a state: a permanent population, defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into diplomatic relations with other states. The EU already possesses three of these four: a permanent population – the Lisbon Treaty makes us all EU citizens; a defined territory – the EU nations all have clear, defined boundaries; a government – well, UKIP has long argued that this Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the real power, the Commission, are all part of an EU government. That leaves the fourth and final component: the capacity for a nation state to enter into relations with other nation states. I believe that through the Lisbon Treaty, through Baroness Ashton’s role and the External Action Service, the European Union now has all four criteria it needs under international law to declare itself a single nation state – a United States of Europe – and to do so overnight. (Applause from the centre and left)
 I see there are many supporters here of that – that confirms my speech and the threat to our nation states! David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, I do not think any of us can fail to be sympathetic to the people of Kyrgyzstan for the recent suffering they have endured: 2 000 dead in rioting and 400 000 people displaced – mainly from the Uzbek community – placing enormous pressure on Uzbekistan. This is an immense crisis, in the words of the Red Cross. This country is already the poorest and the smallest of the former Soviet republics. It is tragic for a country that aspires so earnestly for parliamentary democracy to be in this kind of state. Indeed, the trigger seemed to have been the constitutional changes that they wished to aspire to. It is also one of the few Muslim nations in the world to be headed up by a woman; let us hope that Iran follows shortly. This lady, Roza Otunbayeva, is the first president of an ex-communist central Asian country – and good for her. All democratic nations should be doing all they can to support an aspiring parliamentary democracy of this sort, but it is swimming in a sea of powerful autocratic neighbours and with the ever-present threat of radical Islam on its borders. This nation is a bulkhead of democracy and deserves our support. I fear it has become a pawn in larger power games. It is now part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which China and Russia use to dominate the Central Asian landmass and whose agenda should be regarded with some suspicion. China and Russia have incentives to destabilise the country to threaten the presence of an American airbase there as well, with covert backing of opposition forces. May I conclude by saying that all democratic nations should support this brave, aspiring but deeply troubled nation. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer Report in the European Parliament because it is a sloppily-drafted dog’s dinner which does not clearly support country of origin labelling for simple foods like meats and eggs. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers selling their goods and for consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We have rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the consumer. The rapporteur herself has stated she is afraid the proposal is moving too fast. UKIP believe MEPs are acting without sufficient information on this matter. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have no doubt that all of us here are in favour of human rights. Indeed, many of these are rooted in the finest traditions of English laws – such as the Magna Carta of 1215, which outlawed arbitrary imprisonment, and the work of the British lawyers who wrote much of the European Convention on Human Rights after the war. But it seems that a worthy agenda of human rights has now been hijacked by greedy lawyers and political opportunists. Over the water from the UK, here in Strasbourg, sits the European Court of Human Rights. Now its Committee of Ministers has ruled that Britain must overturn its ban on allowing prisoners to vote because it violates the human rights of prisoners. But are human rights not meant to protect decent, law-abiding citizens, not terrorists, hijackers, murderers and law-breakers? Is it really any court’s job to ask us, as politicians, to seek votes from the likes of Ian Huntley, the paedophile who murdered two little girls in Soham, in my constituency? Is it justice to seek his approval? Is it right to knock on the cell door of Rose West, a serial killer, securing her support? And what of Abu Qatada, Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe? Who will he be voting for? Possibly the Liberal Democrats, because they support this nonsense! Yet, seriously, these large prison populations could swing marginal votes, especially at the local level. So there should be no equivalence of rights between decent, law-abiding citizens and those of murderers and criminals. They forfeited their right to participate in the political process when they took other people’s lives, other people’s rights and other people’s property. What about the rights of victims? What about human responsibilities rather than just rights? Like the euro, I believe the currency of human rights is rapidly being debased. We need a return to good common sense.

– UKIP do not support cancellation of debt on the basis that it is economically unsound on the following points: 1. A creditor nation is usually a debtor nation. For example, the UK is a significant donor of overseas aid. Yet the UK, and therefore its tax payers, are usually unwilling donors to aid recipients whilst debt mountains pile up for UK plc. 2. Debt cancellation impairs Third World debtor countries from raising further international finance. Therefore, it is not in the debtor nation’s interest. 3. Debt cancellation introduces moral hazard. What of Third World countries which meet debt obligations, of which there are many? 4. Cancellation implicitly condones fraud, corruption and the misappropriation of loans so endemic in African debtor countries. 5. Given the massive debt now of most international economies, who arbitrates where cancellation is appropriate? Further moral hazard. John Bufton  (EFD

– We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean. This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa. It would also allow North African al-Qaeda operatives in these countries to more easily enter Europe and carry out terrorist attacks.

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– We voted against this report in accordance with UKIP principles and on the basis that we support legislation only where it limits the power of the EU or returns it to nation states. Any amendments that we felt unnecessarily harmed British farmers were not supported, as were any amendments that expanded EU control in this sector. UKIP will continue to defend the interests of British farmers against EU interference, as we feel the British agricultural sector is perfectly capable of running its own affairs, and already has high standards of both quality and safety. UKIP opposes the way CAP has historically been used in corrupt ways (e.g. phantom vineyards) or the way it is used to top-up the income of certain politicians in EU countries who own ‘farms’. UKIP also objects to being forced to subsidise farms in other parts of Europe, which compete with our own farmers. UKIP is committed to trade in agricultural produce, under the terms of WTO rules.

 – Mr President, my French is not very good – pardonnez-moi –
 but I do understand that the French word ‘gouvernement
’ means government in English. I thought that was easy to understand. However, it does not seem to be easy for the British Labour Government or for President Van Rompuy. They seem to think it means governance, which is defined as the action or manner of governing. That is just dissembling, since the reality is that the EU Council’s agreement to improve economic EU gouvernement
 means the action of ruling and directing the affairs of a state. The truth, then, is that the Council has handed yet more powers over to the EU, including powers over the UK economy, which is the single most important issue to the British people today. When will people be told the truth? We are heading for an EU superstate, and Britain will have to pay to rescue those in the euro area – even though it is not, thankfully, a member of the euro itself.

– UKIP is totally opposed to people-trafficking as it is a modern day version of slavery. We call for the highest penalties in the land for those criminals perpetrating such a crime and for serious measures to wipe out such activity. However, we cannot support the EU using people-trafficking as a pretext to harmonise immigration and border policies over the heads of elected governments. It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability. If there were not open borders within the EU, and each country had its own immigration policy, serious organised crime and people-trafficking would be much easier to stamp out.

– UKIP is gravely concerned with the situation in Iran and calls for governments on both sides to come to a diplomatic, but above all, peaceful solution to the ongoing political and humanitarian breakdown in the country. The EU must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate the tense situation. Unaccountable EU bureaucrats, instead of elected politicians leading the negotiations, will end up with a bad outcome for Iran and the rest of the world. Negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments, not forced upon from above by the EU. There are many countries wanting to stay neutral, such as Ireland, and the EU representing those countries on this issue seriously undermines their democratically-backed policy.

– UKIP fully supports the relief efforts and is horrified at the loss of life and those affected by the disaster, but we cannot support legitimising the EU in spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money, along with its militaristic and diplomatic ambition to circumvent democratic and accountable nation states intervening in the crisis. Of course, we encourage government and individuals to give relief and money to help those affected and rebuild the country. However, this must be done transparently with the public and not by secretive, unelected bureaucrats with international ambitions of grandeur. David Campbell Bannerman,

– Mr President, Amendment 1 of this housing resolution proposes to extend use of the European Regional Development Fund to all Member States, not just those joining in 2004. So this is directly relevant to Britain. It is clear from the resolution that the Roma population is the largest marginalised community in the report receiving support, plus others of similar socio-economic condition. The overall budget for the European cohesion policy is a staggering EUR 347 billion over seven years – larger than many economies, even. My constituents in East Anglia are already deeply concerned at the scale of the traveller and gypsy communities, particularly so in Essex. They will be angry should any of these measures facilitate yet more EU mass immigration. Britain has already seen a rise in population of three and a half million – half the size of London – in the 12 years since the Labour Government came to power in 1997. Given, too, that nearly nine out of ten new British homes – 86% – will be due to immigration over the next 30 years, proposals like these seem to be yet another bridgehead for major immigration into Britain. We do not have the room. It is about space, not race. Controlled immigration through permits and visas is a good thing, but uncontrolled immigration is a bad thing, for that is the fast route to extremism, which none of us desire. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Madam President, in my English constituency this week, it was discovered that scientists from the University of East Anglia were allegedly manipulating data to try and prove man-made global warming. What a giveaway that was! It is clear now that the scientific consensus on man-made global warming is fast eroding: 30 000 sceptical scientists in the Manhattan Declaration; 600 scientists in a US Senate report; even German scientists this year writing to Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, the author of the key UN report on this, Sir Nicholas Stern, urges us to become vegetarian to stop cows farting. Maybe it is not just certain cows that have gone mad. I am on the Committee on International Trade. I am deeply concerned with the WTO talks starting this week. I worry about a drift towards green tariffs justified on the basis of such spurious claims. These new tariffs are just barriers to trade, they punish the poor and have no justification whatsoever. This is just enviro-imperialism. David Campbell Bannerman  (EFD

– Mr President, this Brok report is positive proof of the emergence of a single European Union superstate. The wicked Lisbon constitution already forces an unelected President and Foreign Minister on us all. Now this report adds a new European diplomatic service, the so-called European External Action Service, but embassies represent national interests. So what national interests will these new EU diplomats and embassies represent? They will not be those of our nation states, our trade or our companies. They will be those of the European Commission. All other national embassies will become redundant. Already, British embassies around the world are selling off properties. This master plan for an EU superstate is built on foundations of deceit, dishonesty and denial, but federalists are not creating a new United States of America. They are creating a new Yugoslavia. By forcing very different nations, cultures and economies together under a rigid, undemocratic Soviet-style bureaucracy, you are entering very dangerous waters indeed. I worked for the British Government on the Northern Ireland peace process. I saw what happened when democracy fails. It is not pretty. Now I see democracy failing here in Europe. You profess to love peace but, by railroading through Lisbon and by this power grab of our embassies, you are putting Europe firmly back on the road towards war once again.

− We acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, particularly for beef and sheep farmers in the South and East of England who, by wholesale vaccination on their own farms, have created a firewall against bluetongue that their fellow farmers in the North and West have benefited from. In order to vote for EU funding for this vaccine we are obliged (in the same vote) to vote for increased funding for Eurojust and Europol. These are two agencies that operate outside the boundaries acceptable to British law, severely increasing the power of the state at the expense of the liberty of the individual. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, we could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains our voting abstention on the subject. David Campbell Bannerman,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this is my first, or maiden, speech in this Parliament. As a UKIP MEP for the East of England, you will expect me to be a rebel and I will try not to disappoint you or my voters. We are discussing today EU trade agreements and, in particular, that with South Korea, due to be signed this year. As we do not have much of the detail on this particular agreement, other than the fact, I believe, that two thirds of the benefits will accrue to South Korea and one third to the EU, I would like to make some more general points. Many people are not aware that there are over a hundred separate bilateral EU trade agreements like this one; 116 is one estimate. There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa. In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein. There are also trade agreements with non-EU EEA and EFTA countries such as Switzerland and Norway. Norway’s trade agreement religiously protects both its fishing and farming, and Norway is not a minnow. It is the EU’s fourth largest import partner and sixth largest export market. What should a trade agreement like South Korea’s really contain, then? Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example. There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products. There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland. There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area. The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU’s film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants. There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters. In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost. It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access, but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion, a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year. Nor is Switzerland an insignificant trading partner either: 80% of Swiss exports go to the EU, and it is the EU’s fourth largest trading partner. My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources. Even the Commission website admits ‘Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings. It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.’ How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers’ Directive or the new Fund Managers’ Directive! So I conclude in asking, why not Britain? Why cannot Britain have a similar, friendly trade agreement with the EU like South Korea instead of full EU membership? Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year. We, too, can have the kind of assurances the Swiss enjoy. We could, and I believe we should, be an independent free trading nation once again such as Norway, Switzerland and even South Korea. John Bufton  (EFD

This summit sees us discuss, once again, the EU’s Youth Employment Initiative, its place within wider efforts to foster growth, jobs and EU competitiveness, and the aim of making it fully operational by January 2014. The UK currently has a youth unemployment rate of 21 %. This means that approximately 1 million 18-25 year olds in the country are out of work. And, as of 1 January 2014, when 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians will be allowed to enter the country freely, the youth job market – and, more than likely, the job market as a whole – is sure to reach saturation point. We can sit here and discuss and dissect the Youth Employment Initiative all day and all night but my party and I quite simply cannot see how this initiative will make any real positive impact in our country. It is clear to me that the only way to ease the youth employment crisis we are currently facing in the UK is to leave the EU, regain proper control of our borders and make sure that any available jobs are done by our own young people.

Firstly, it is important to emphasise that the UK is not part of this scheme. Moreover, we are against this directive as it supports a proposal, in the area of gathering and exchanging information on border security, which will give the Commission further power over immigration control. Whilst my party strongly advocates better control of UK borders, we believe Britain should not cede any power over border security to other bodies within the EU. John Bufton  (EFD

I voted against this proposal as my party believes that the existing Batteries Directive prohibits the placing on the market of portable batteries and accumulators, including those incorporated in devices or products, which contain more than 0.002% of cadmium by weight, with exceptions for certain categories of products. We believe the existing provision is more than sufficient to deal with this issue and that further EU legislation is not needed. John Bufton  (EFD

I am not in favour of the creation or expansion of unified criminal law and criminal proceedings across the European Union.

This is an important issue, which should be covered by national legislation rather than by the EU. Ideally it should be possible to introduce and support practical anti-discriminatory measures. It is rather disappointing that the EU is trying to promote itself as a protagonist in the fight against caste-based discrimination while in reality appearing to use sensitive issues such as this to reinforce its competence in foreign affairs.

This is another example of how citizens are fed up and disappointed with the EU: often, complainants resort to these petitions simply because it is seen as a way to protest. The Committee on Petitions has no real power to change anything and yet it continues to ask for more petitions – just in order to create more unnecessary legislation. Individuals with genuine complaints should be able to have those complaints resolved at domestic level through sovereign parliaments. John Bufton  (EFD

I voted against this because the agreement concerns steps and processes for establishing the European Banking Union, which my party opposes. This directive calls for regular exchanges of views with the relevant parliamentary committee, oral discussions behind closed doors with the bureau of the same committee and, ultimately, better access to information, including the non-confidential parts of the minutes of the Supervisory Board. In my view such measures are very harmful to the interests of British companies. John Bufton  (EFD

I voted to support this motion as it refuses to grant the Secretary-General of the Council discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Council budget for the financial year 2011.

I am against this directive because the UK already faces a number of immigration and healthcare challenges which would only increase if the directive were to be adopted. On the one hand, introducing a virtual professional qualifications card that would make it easier for European healthcare professionals to move and practice in other EU countries would cause a brain drain in some European countries that are in dire need of qualified healthcare professionals. On the other hand, it would increase the difficulties in already challenged labour markets in countries such as the UK, which are struggling to support local workers while dealing with an influx of legal and illegal immigration.

I prefer not to give our consent to such agreements, particularly as we have our own immigration policies in the UK and do not want EU involvement in such legislative concerns. The question of readmission of illegal immigrants from Armenia, and those who are no longer in possession of a valid permit to work and/or live in the EU, should be dealt with through a bilateral agreement with Armenia, which I believe will be far more efficient.

I believe that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade block in order to sign trade agreements. Iceland, for instance, has now suspended its application for EU membership which in our view is a wise decision. In the context of trade, if Iceland were to join the EU it would then be obliged to abandon the independent trade agreement it has already with China. This is the reason we abstained on this directive. John Bufton  (EFD

A sovereign nation does not need to be a part of a large trade block in order to sign trade agreements, which is why I abstained from voting for EU-Taiwan trade relations.

My party has made it very clear from the outset that we oppose all aspects of this Directive. No-one can dispute that smoking is a major health issue that affects the whole of Europe. Indeed we have all seen the statistics – that over 700 000 people a year in Europe die of smoking. However shocking this figure is, though, it is ultimately these people’s right to smoke – and the EU certainly does not have the right to try and stop them. Ironically, the measures outlined in the Directive are flawed on so many levels that they are unlikely to stop people smoking anyway. Banning smalls packs will simply make people buy more cigarettes. Banning menthol and other flavoured cigarettes will simply increase the cigarette black market. Demanding that large health warnings be put on cigarette packs will make counterfeiting easier, fuelling the black market yet further. Once again, the EU has failed to see the wood for the trees here and, as a result, this Directive is not only misinformed and unfounded but entirely unfit for purpose. John Bufton  (EFD

Against. I voted against the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement on a Civil Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) between the European Community and its Member States and Ukraine for two reasons: firstly, because I believe that the British Government alone should have the right to conclude international agreements which affect the UK and secondly, because in my opinion the GNSS is a huge waste of money which is not proving to be operational and to the benefit of UK citizens.

Against. Although I feel very sorry for those people facing huge changes in their life through unemployment, I am unable to support this. The IT industry still holds a lot of potential for the future.

I would rather see the money spent on a thorough evaluation of the fund. John Bufton  (EFD

I must laud the Commission Presidentʼs attempt to put a positive spin on the current State of the Union, however, I quite simply fail to buy into his over optimistic and ideological view. And I am sure I am not the only one. Europe is, in reality, nowhere near an economic recovery – fragile or otherwise. And this incessant pursuit of forming a Europe-wide banking union is unlikely to aid recovery. It is, if anything, more likely to lead Europe into an even deeper financial mess. Similarly, his suggestion that we continue to work in the same way to alleviate unemployment levels in the EU is simply absurd. One look at the figures tells us that the schemes and systems implemented to date have been ineffective – and yet he insists on forcing the Member States to continue down this road to ruin. To end on a positive note, although it is unusual for the Commission President to express opinions about the internal political situation in a Member State, I welcome his acknowledgement that UKIP is fast becoming a real fighting force in UK politics. The real brand of euro-scepticism that our party offers is finally receiving the recognition it deserves. John Bufton  (EFD

 I voted against the discharge of the 2012 Commission budget because the Court of Auditors has not cleared the budget for the nineteenth year in a row. In addition, this year the level of errors in the budget is 4.8% or EUR[nbsp ]6.2 billion. As a responsible politician and an accountant it is impossible for me to approve this discharge Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the discharge of the Railway Agency in particular because of the wastefulness of its two headquarters in Lille and Valenciennes, two cities that are 50 kilometres apart. This is a very good example of European duplication and waste, though one that still falls short of the two seats of this Parliament. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, when I was European Commission Chief Accountant back in 2002, I pointed out huge flaws in the accounting systems. Today it is still just as bad – or even worse – than it was back then. Yet MEPs will grant discharge to the budget, despite a hole of EUR[nbsp ]6.2 billion in the accounts. It is now clear to me that the discharge procedure is a pantomime. There is no longer proper scrutiny or any holding to account for taxpayers’ money by MEPs. What an anomaly! Those who approve the budget are the same voices asking for budget increases, year after year, for the same Member States they blame for the irregularities. We should instead be cutting the EU budget by a minimum of the same level of the error. In May, taxpayers should call to account all the MEPs who approve of this ludicrous situation. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). - 
 Madam President, it is that time of the year again when we put forward our wishes regarding what the EU budget should be spent on. Headlines like ‘investing in research and innovation’, ‘strengthening EU industry’ or ‘job creation’ are repeated year after year. We are supposed to have been investing in those areas for the last decade. It has made no difference, as the crisis has demonstrated, and yet the Commission keeps asking for more money. This is in spite of the fact that the auditors say that the level of irregularities has increased. As I see it, the Commission has totally failed to demonstrate any efficiency in controlling taxpayers’ money. Would anybody in their right mind invest in such a badly-run organisation? The answer would certainly be no. So why do we keep asking for more money from taxpayers? It is this Parliament’s role to call the Commission to account and say ‘no’ to business as usual.

 I voted against the Gardiazabal Rubial report on the General guidelines for the 2015 budget – Section III. The guidelines as always seek to increase the EU budget and turn a blind eye to the continuing high level of irregularities in the budget. In 2012 these were 4.8% of the budget. In addition the Court of Auditors has not approved the EU books for the nineteenth consecutive year. The EU budget exists to make the EU relevant to the citizens of Member States but in the light of the EU’s continuing role in the financial crisis, even it is not enough to make the citizens want to continue with the project.

 I voted against the Zuber report on equality between women and men in the European Union because, yet again, European federalists are using the natural human instinct of fairness to extend the EU’s remit into areas where the European Union has not been given competence.

 I voted against the Costello Report on the Fund for European aid to the most deprived. Our government strongly supports measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion. But it does not believe that the Fund for European aid to the most deprived will be an effective way of doing this. We were one of a number of Member States which argued that this was an area of national competence and we have not participated in the previous food-bank schemes since the mid-1990s. Both Houses of Parliament have adopted Reasoned Opinions stating that the Commissionʼs proposal is inconsistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against the De Backer Report on the European Semester. While the report is in the main part acceptable and supports Conservative priorities such as structural reforms, tax simplification and a stronger single market in services, there are too many concessions made to the Left.

 I voted against this report because it fails in its stated aims. Decreasing the length of delay after which compensation can be claimed from five to three hours would incentivise airlines to cancel flights in order to maintain their schedule and minimise compensation. Secondly, it would put a disproportionate burden on feeder flights. If adopted, these proposals would lead to a reduction in services (particularly from the regions) and would threaten ‘inter-lining’, thus increasing journey times and requiring passengers to check baggage in and out for ‘connecting flights’. In addition, the proposals would not remove a clause suspending the application of air-passenger-rights legislation to Gibraltar. In 2006, the UK, Spain and the Government of Gibraltar concluded the ‘Cordoba Agreement’ to ensure that Gibraltar Airport was part of the EU’s single market. I share the UK Government’s strong view that Gibraltar is an EU airport and that, in line with the Treaties, all EU aviation measures must be extended to Gibraltar. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I voted against this report because our energy market must be free from the burden of expensive renewable energy quotas. I cannot support this joint committee report calling for the continuation of the 2020 binding targets on emissions reduction and renewables, as well as a mandatory target for energy efficiency.

 I voted for the oral question on female genital mutilation (FGM), asking the Commission about its intentions to propose a strategy and action plan aimed at addressing FGM. Although I do not want to see an EU legislative instrument, I would like to see more coherent policy, detailing how Member States can tackle this brutality. In particular, I would like to see Member States pursuing, prosecuting and punishing any EU resident who has carried out FGM, and I would like to see them recognise that FGM is a gross form of violence against women and violence against the child. (According to the World Health Organisation, the majority of cases of FGM have involved young girls between infancy and the age of 15.) Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 The EMPL and ECON committees wanted to initiate consultation with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) on the subject of the structure and organisation of social dialogue in the context of a genuine Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

 This report addresses perceived difficulties caused by differing rules and requirements across the Member States relating to official documents such as birth certificates and residency permits. Presently most Member States require documents to be authenticated, either through legalisation or apostille procedures, where documents have been issued in another country, including other Member States. However, the rapporteur has chosen to increase significantly the scope of the legislation, whilst Tory amendments to introduce greater safeguards against fraud and forgery were rejected. As a consequence I voted against this proposal. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 This directive updates the 2003 Market Abuse Directive by introducing maximum jail sentences of at least four years for market abuse, such as insider dealing, market manipulation and unlawful disclosure of information. It complements the regulation adopted last year which imposed large fines on companies involved in such practices. It should be noted that while the UK already imposes more severe criminal sanctions than required by the proposal, it has an opt-out on this legislation under Protocol 21. Nevertheless, as many Member States have hitherto imposed less severe penalties in this area, I voted in favour of the report to reduce the number of cases of market abusers taking advantage of lax jurisdictions.

 This regulation has been resubmitted to Parliament due to an incorrect legal basis being used in the original proposal. A notification mechanism will be put in place for Member States to provide the Commission with certain data and information regarding investment projects in energy infrastructure that concern the production, storage and transport of oil, natural gas and electricity. I voted in favour of this report as it will help to build a better understanding of the EU’s energy infrastructure, which will be particularly important when reviewing and planning energy security policies.

 Part of this report is dedicated to the procedure on the appointment of the Court of Auditors’ members and consultation with Parliament. It is stressed that some appointments to the Court have given rise to differences between Parliament and the Council, and it is considered unacceptable that the Council appoints members to the Court of Auditors despite Parliament’s unfavourable opinion. Here, I support the current application of Article 286 TFEU, whereby the Council has the right to adopt candidates for the Court of Auditors after consulting the European Parliament. I defend the Council’s right to override a negative opinion by the European Parliament. Consequently I voted against this report. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

 I am concerned that this report goes way beyond the competence of REGI and deals with questions that ought to fall within the sole competence of ITRE. Moreover, as Parliament has already adopted reports on the role of cohesion policy in implementing EU energy policy and on the implementation of energy efficiency measures under cohesion policy, this report is unnecessary and unhelpful. Beyond this question of competence, the report calls for ambitious strategies and policies for dealing with CO2
 emissions – in particular, the call for further ambitious binding energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. I am firmly opposed to the setting of any such ambitious targets which prioritise renewable energies over other low-carbon alternatives. Moreover, I am strongly opposed to the earmarking of 20 % of ERDF funding in the recent 2014-2020 Common Provisions Regulation for strategies to develop a low-carbon economy. The report is overwhelmingly prescriptive concerning this point. It is for these reasons that I voted against it. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted for the Tarabella Report on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors. I strongly support the reform package as it includes new measures to simplify procedures, cut red tape, support SMEs and promote value for money. It will also enhance the functioning of the single market, promote reform and accountability, and provide greater legal clarity. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Caspary Report on access of third-country goods and services to the Unionʼs internal market in public procurement and procedures supporting negotiations on access of Union goods and services to the public procurement markets of third countries. My vote was against the proposed regulation because it could lead to a net reduction in market access and could diminish growth potential at a time when it is needed most. This is the position of a majority of the Member States in the Council. There are significant risks in deploying the proposed instrument as a leveraging tool in trade negotiations as it could leave the EU open to damaging retaliatory measures, losing out on growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets.

I voted for the Macovei Report on the Hercule III programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the European Unionʼs financial interests because the new programme continues to place specific emphasis on the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, which are estimated to cost Member States EUR 11 billion per annum. The programme reflects the Commissionʼs legal obligations stemming from agreements with four international tobacco manufacturers. Even though questions do remain regarding the effectiveness of such programmes, in this case efforts must be made to manage the administrative costs of the programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). - 
 Mr President, there is no doubt that smuggling and the counterfeiting of cigarettes are matters of serious concern for us all. The large sums of money lost, which should be going to exchequers across the EU, are significant, and this means that front-line services are not being as well supported as they should be. But let us be honest: the amounts of taxpayers’ money wasted by the EU institutions are also significant. Some 4.8 % of the EU budget in 2012 was spent on regional projects which should never have received the money – a total of EUR 5.5 billion. Only in December did we learn that billions in aid to Gaza and Egypt cannot be properly accounted for, having been spent on out-of-work politicians. And almost every month we receive a new Court of Auditors’ report spelling out more errors and more wasted money. If MEPs are serious about looking after EU financial interests, they should look closer to home as well as to the Hercule III programme. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Kadenbach report on ‘Eco-innovation - jobs and growth through environmental policyʼ because I believe that what is really needed is to focus on the implementation of existing legislation before proposing fresh regulations.

I voted against the Harkin report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund 2014-2020 because, while it is purportedly designed to show solidarity towards workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation, it is not an efficient and systematic instrument to reduce the impact of the economic crisis. It has never functioned properly, it has lived too long already and should be shut down, not extended. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted for the Mitchell report on resilience and disaster-risk reduction (DRR) in developing countries because it focuses on actions to help the most vulnerable, poorest and marginalised populations, which are the most exposed to risks, while on a broader scale targeting fragile and crisis-prone countries.

I voted against the Gardini report on a civil protection mechanism because the budget for the civil protection mechanism will almost double in the next seven years from EUR 189 million to EUR 326.6 million, which I consider unacceptable.

I am concerned also about the proposed new 24/7 European Emergency Response Capacity which could unnecessarily interfere with Member Statesʼ response to disasters inside the EU. Marta Andreasen,

Mr President, this report represents a broken promise. The Commission assured us that they would get errors under control. Instead, they are on the rise again: up from 3.9% in 2011 to 4.8% in 2012. That is over EUR 6 billion of taxpayers’ money that cannot be properly accounted for. Like the vast majority of the public I am disgusted that the Commission is paying lip service to getting their finances in order. However, what really bothers my patience in this House is the ‘business as usual’ mentality, where irregularities are tolerated despite the huge amounts of money involved. The Commission just gets a polite slap on the wrist. In any private enterprise, if almost 5% of the budget was in error, heads would roll and the shareholders would quite rightly demand change at the top. Instead, this Parliament, which blames the Member States for irregularities, is happy to ask for a bigger EU budget, to give to those same Member States. What a contradiction! Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the Koppa report on the implementation of the Common Security and Defence Policy (based on the Annual Report from the Council to the Union Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy). The report wants greater harmonisation of EU defence policy, pooling of Member States’ budgets to fund military operations – including expanded common costs of EU battlegroups – and permanent structured cooperation. My party has consistently argued for improved EU coordination with NATO rather than the establishment of new EU strategies and expensive institutions within the CSDP framework.

I voted against the oral question to the Commission – Social dimension of EMU because it is an attempt to interfere in an area in which the EU has no competence, healthcare, homelessness, work index, etc. These are all within the competence of the Member States and the UK has no intention of handing them over to Brussels. In addition the oral question refers to a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme, something much desired by European federalists that will never happen. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the budget of the European Union for 2014 because this is taxpayer money that lacks control. Every year there is evidence of gross mismanagement and even fraud, to the point where the books of the Commission have not been signed off by the Auditors for 19 years. The report of the Court of Auditors for 2012 has the level of ‘irregularities’ up to 4.8%. No responsible person can vote for this. In addition, the United Kingdom is a net contributor that has little say over what the money is spent on. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

I voted against the La Via report on DAB 9/2013. I do not support the method chosen of financing the fund. EUR 519 million was available at the end of 2013 through the ‘global transfer’, a mopping-up procedure that is executed in every budgetary year to reallocate unused funds in the budget, and the ECR believes that the DAB 9/2013 would have been better financed using money from this procedure rather than placing EUR 150m in the budget for 2014.

I oppose this, as it extends both sugar quotas and wine quotas, to which I am strongly opposed, as well as increasing the possibilities of intervention in the dairy product market.

I voted in favour of the De Haene-Kalfin report on the MFF because it is in fact the first time that a reduction in the multiannual budget has taken place. This is in large measure due to the tough position the leader of my party, Mr Cameron, took in the Council negotiations on the MFF last year.

I voted against the La Via report on draft amending budget No 8 of 2013. This was a request from the Commission for a 11.2 billion top-up to the 2013 budget.

 Mr President, during my time as an MEP, this House has come every year, without exception, with a request to increase the EU budget and this, regardless of the current crisis and the austerity measures. Every year too, without fail, the Auditors have refused to approve the management of those EU funds. The problem is one of failure: failure to control that the taxpayers’ money is properly spent. As recently as July, the Court of Auditors reported EUR 3 billion of waste in road construction projects. This audit only covered four countries so I fear that the overall figure across the EU would be much higher. If we did a proper job we would not need to engage in a multi-million information campaign ahead of the 2014 elections. EU taxpayers do not trust us because we do not look after their interests; we should stop putting more money into this black hole. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, at long last the saga that was the negotiation of the EU long-term budget, the MFF, has concluded. This House backed away from the frankly ridiculous EUR 1 trillion that it had been asking. We agree that EUR 960 billion is still a massive figure but it represents, for the first time since multiannual budgeting began in 1993, a reduction in the EU budget. This is something that, as you will know, I have been asking for since I first became an MEP. But the public will not be rejoicing. They know that the MFF is still full of vanity projects such as Galileo and the ineffective European External Action Service, headed by Catherine Ashton. While today is a step in the right direction, I fear that Parliament will, as in previous years, return like Oliver Twist to ask for more money. I hope flexibility does not mean a blank cheque book. Marta Andreasen  (ECR

Mr President, if anyone needed evidence of how inefficient the EU institutions are, then the seven years it has taken to finalise a revision of the OLAF regulatory framework is surely proof enough. It seems that even when agreement has been reached among institutions there is need for further amendments.  However, the most important issue here today is the independence of OLAF, which this framework actually fails to put right. The Anti-Fraud Office is primarily aimed at avoiding fraud and corruption affecting EU funds. It should there be, by its very definition, independent of the institutions involved in handling those funds – notably the European Commission, but also the European Parliament and the European Council. OLAF should report directly, without EU intermediaries, to the European citizens who fund the EU budget, and its regulation must not be subject to any politics. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Madam President, no one denies that well-funded companies and wealthy investors may be trying to avoid tax. The tax avoiders are mostly in Europe, America or other developed countries. However, when we talk about tax havens, they are mostly in small jurisdictions outside of those countries. This report is really a request for the EU to start controlling tax policy over which it has no competence. Tax is the competence of national governments in the EU and elsewhere. The truth is that clamping down on tax havens requires agreement between all the governments involved; otherwise, it is a pointless exercise. In any case we already have the OECD’s Financial Action Task Force working on this. Europe just wants to get its hands on what is at present a sovereign matter for the nations of Europe. One cannot help thinking that this is exactly what they wanted in the first place. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -  
Mr President, once again we are being asked whether or not we approve the management of EU funds by the European Commission. The Court of Auditors has, for the 18th year in a row, refused to clear the EU budget, but this has never led this Parliament to actually act. When the auditors talk about significant material errors, breach of public procurement rules, claims for non-existent animals and incorrect activation of entitlements, they are actually describing the way in which European taxpayers’ money is being misappropriated. The level of irregularities has actually gone up to almost 4%, so the question here is: when is the European Commission actually going to be held to account for this abominable failure? Because whatever blame we want to put on the beneficiaries, it is actually the Commission which asks for our taxes to fund the budgets and which should therefore ensure they are properly spent before releasing them. I am not holding my breath. This Parliament will vote to approve the EU accounts once again. However, the UK and the Netherlands have refused to approve them and I hope many more Member States will follow suit. Marta Andreasenon,  
on behalf of the ECR Group

 Mr President, this House should be the first to lead by example and cut our own costs in line with the austerity measures being imposed around Europe. While I recognise that Parliament’s administration has made an effort to achieve some reductions, there are still many areas where more could and should be done. The most obvious is the ‘three seat’ cost of Parliament. Why not cut out this complex arrangement, for which taxpayers pay more than EUR 250 million per year? The proposed budget includes another significant increase for European political parties – an expenditure line which will have grown by 50% in the last couple of years. What is the purpose of this increase if there will not be a European constituency in the coming elections and Members will be elected from national lists? Projects like the European House of History or the Parliamentarium also continue to absorb more taxpayers’ money. All these costs will not increase the visibility or the credibility of this institution. It is only the hard work and the integrity of the Members which will convince citizens of the importance of this institution. If we continue to ignore this reality we should not be surprised when few turn out to vote in the next European elections. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, since I became an MEP I have been fighting for a reduction in the EU budget. The economic growth promised by the Lisbon Agenda and financed by the current long-term budget has instead brought economic stagnation. I fully support the deal negotiated by the British Prime Minister at the European Council. It represents the first cut in the EU budget since 1993. I have therefore voted in favour of my group’s MFF resolution which endorses the agreement reached by the prime ministers of the 27 Member States early in February 2013. Like other political groups, the ECR emphasises the need to spend more efficiently, rather than simply spend more. It enshrines sound financial management as the guiding principle of the EU budget. I regard the rejection of the Council agreement by the other groups as a slap in the face of European taxpayers. We should lead by example and share the austerity burden; instead the European Parliament has shown its gluttony. Marta Andreasen  (ECR
). -   
Mr President, I find it ludicrous that this House is trying to push ahead on the negotiation of the 2014 budget, on the one hand, while on the other it refuses to back the agreement made by Heads of State on the seven-year budget starting next year. On top of this, the guidelines on the 2014 budget refer to extra payments that need to be covered for past and current years, with the amounts remaining totally unclear. The Commission and Parliament insist on using the word ‘deficit’, whereas this concept does not apply to the EU budget, as revenues are raised from Member States to cover the agreed budget. It is time for Parliament and the Council to call on the Commission to assume its responsibility on the budget and its implementation by providing reliable accounting information as to where and when EU taxpayers’ money is being spent. I am not therefore in a position to vote in favour of the Jensen report. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, the Multiannual Financial Framework has not actually been decided so this debate on 2014 budget guidelines appears to be premature. That aside, and given the economic situation of Europe, I believe it is now time to perform a cost-benefit analysis in regard to the whole of the EU budget. That cost-benefit analysis should start with all the mini-institutions that have been growing like mushrooms in the last decade.  Take for example the EEAS, the European External Action Service. What is the benefit that this institution brings to European citizens? Baroness Ashton has said that it will not replace national embassies. Great! So why do we need it? And the Committee of the Regions, has it actually helped regions develop their economies. No, it does not seem so. If the EU really wanted to help Member States and taxpayers, it would simply abandon budget lines that have no added value – but this will not happen. We will only continue to spend our time trying to window-dress little cuts here and there. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, I must admit that my curiosity was raised by this report. Contrary to its normal strategy of centralising and seizing control as much as possible, the EU is now proposing that banks and investment firms assess for themselves the credit risk of entities or instruments in which they invest, and is asking them not to rely on external ratings. The report even proposes to take ratings out of the Financial Regulation and eliminate risk-weighting of assets through external rating or internal models.  How this would contribute to making the evaluation of risk independent or avoid conflicts of interests, is really a mystery to me. Whether we like it or not, these agencies provide an independent view, and the fact that some would find that they have become too powerful is no basis for them being muscled out in such a way. It is as if the EU wants to remove any analytical road blocks that stand in its way. I wonder why. In response to Mrs Lulling, I would like to say yes, the UK should leave the EU. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, the negotiation of the annual EU budget has become a farce. Last year Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed up to an increase of just over 2 % for 2012. Yet last October the Commission was asking for no less than EUR 9 billion of extra cash and this House has joined the cry for more money. This is a 9 % increase, not a 2 % increase.  Of course last year’s agreement allowed for an increase in the legal obligations the EU could enter into, the so-called commitments. But this fact seemed to go unnoticed by the Heads of State. The fact is that we face the same situation for 2013, as the legal obligations are now growing by up to EUR 151 billion and who picks up the tab? The taxpayers. Frontline services are being cut in Member States while the EU gets on with its own wasteful agenda.  Mr Cameron, please do not come back claiming victory this time. It would be a serious insult to your people.  (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I think that this is not the main issue. The main issue is where we are spending money. You are now running a political campaign against Mr Farage, but that is up to you. I can tell you that I have been involved in the fisheries reform.

Mr President, it is no surprise that only ten Member States at most are willing to adopt a financial transaction tax. The majority of states know that this tax would only push the financial sector out of Europe, to the further detriment of their economies. Insisting on forcing this tax through by means of enhanced cooperation will only make it more evident that it is the wrong way to go. The ill-fated Swedish initiative back in the 1980s should be seen as a good reason for not proceeding. In addition, there are two aspects of the proposal that have not been laid out in clear terms and which are a matter of concern. The first and most important one is how it will affect non-participating Member States – because it will, notably in the case of cross-border transactions. The second one is how this FTT will be spent.  Regardless, I hope that the British Prime Minister will protect the City from any implications of this tax. Marta Andreasen,

– Madam President, this is now shamefully the 18th year in a row that the auditors cannot clear the EU budget. Worse, 50 % of the samples taken by the auditors show irregularities. The excuses the Commission puts forward are always the same: it is the fault of the Member States: they commit the irregularities. But taxpayers entrust their monies to the European Commission, which abjectly fails to perform essential controls before it hands the cash over to the Member States. This House is also to blame by continually rubber-stamping the EU budget on the basis that ‘error’ does not necessarily mean ‘fraud’. Well, if a farmer gets money for the welfare of his 150 sheep and the auditors find that he does not have any, in the real world this would be considered fraud. The point is that if the Commission refuses to take responsibility for taxpayers’ money and blames Member States, why does it ask for more money to fund those same Member States? This is yet another reason why the EU budget should be cut. What are we waiting for? Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, what has happened with EU budget investment in the last seven years? Well, we all know where we stand today. Budgeting is not a field where the EU can claim success. Why are we putting more money into agricultural funding that amounts, at present, to over 40 % of the budget? We are paying for farmers not to grow food, although the market is there. Have the billions paid out in structural funds to countries like Greece, Portugal or Spain stemmed the crisis there? No, they have not. If there was a serious will to use the budget to develop Europe’s economy, a major rethink would have taken place many years ago. Instead, every year we are asked to top up the same old budget lines. The EU budget for the 2014-2020 period should be reduced drastically to allow Member States to decide where they want to put their taxpayers’ money. The UK should not only veto an increase, but should demand a significant reduction. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is no secret to anybody that the conciliation for 2013 failed before it even started. This was due to the fact that the Commission came up with a request for EUR 9 billion more to cover this year’s payments. I have been deeply sceptical about the need for this extra cash. Most Member States cannot afford cofinancing in these times of crisis. We need to remember that in February this year, two months after the close of the 2011 accounts, the Budget Commissioner told us that there was a shortfall of EUR 11 billion. Then in April, two months later, he told us there was a EUR 1.5 billion surplus. Then, at the conciliation last week, Mr Lewandowski came up with a reduction on payment needs for 2012 of EUR 1.5 billion. So which number should we believe now? This behaviour has seriously affected the credibility of the negotiators, notably the Commission. No more money should be granted to the Commission as long as it fails to produce reliable and precise information. I have been saying this for many years now.

– The only compromise that the Council and the Member States assumed was the number that was agreed upon last December for the 2012 budget. The fact that the Council said that they would put in more money if it was needed refers to unexpected events, such as the flooding in Italy. However, coming up with EUR 9 billion, which is almost 7 % of the budget for 2012, is really unacceptable and shows that there is no accounting that can be relied upon in the Commission.

 Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteur, we should call this report what it really is: a cry for help by the European Parliament to remain relevant. The lesson still has not been learnt. We find ourselves in the current financial mess in large part due to the inefficiency of the European institutions. Angela Merkel recognised this by deciding to act intergovernmentally instead of interinstitutionally, during all the peaks of the crisis. Now we are being asked to empower the same institutions to be the supervisors of this new European Monetary Union, which will also result in an additional burden to taxpayers. In a nutshell, this will entail more staff and even more money and will further remove powers from national supervisors, while the main problems remain unresolved. The EU needs to learn to do much less and do it better. More Europe simply makes a deep hole much deeper. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, Erasmus started 25 years ago, and three million people have taken part. During the period 2007-2013 the EU has paid out grants worth EUR 3 billion on Erasmus. However, the economy has shrunk and youth unemployment has grown massively to 11.7 %. Furthermore, the grant gives an average EUR 300 per month, which is insufficient to cover the basic costs of living. If we add travel costs to this we can estimate that a family needs to pay at least EUR 5 000 per year on top of the grant to cover the total cost of one of its members doing Erasmus. How many families can afford this in these times of crisis? Considering the lack of impact on employment and economic growth that the Erasmus programme has had over the last decade, and given that it can only be afforded by those that are well off, we should scrap it. There are many other priorities that need more urgent attention. Those who find it indispensable to have this development should pay out of their own pocket instead of imposing the burden on the taxpayer. Marta Andreasen,

 Mr President, whether it agrees or not, the European Commission has contributed to the crisis by distributing the European budget without exercising proper controls. Also, through multiple directives, it has imposed a huge burden of regulation on Member States, forcing prohibitive costs on private entrepreneurship. How can the same institution which has failed so gravely make judgments on where and how Member States need to put their taxpayers’ money? SMEs are the backbone of economic expansion and recovery. But by urging the Member States to create access to finance for SMEs, we will achieve nothing, as their coffers are now empty. Why not use the bank bailout money to help SMEs instead of helping failed banks? Why not look for more flexible measures instead of calling for the inclusion of a core set of rights in workers’ contracts? The Commission has not learnt any lessons from the past. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this House is stretching the meaning of the word ‘investment’ beyond elasticity. Can any MEP claim that the many billion euros of taxpayers’ money spent on the Lisbon Agenda have delivered any return? Let us look at the evidence. In 2007, EU unemployment was 7.3 %; today it stands at 10.5 %. In Spain, one of the biggest recipients of cohesion funding over recent years, the jobless figure today sits at 25 %. GDP for the European Union has been flat. We should also not forget that the Court of Auditors has not given EU spending an overall clean bill of health for over a decade. The MFF has been built around a legacy of failed projects, and the 2014-2020 MFF simply seeks to top up those failed projects. Employment comes from new industry and new industry requires capital, flexibility and less red tape – none of which the European Union helps with. The MFF needs a haircut and not a Financial Transaction Tax to pay for more waste. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I supported Amendment 1263 on the House of European History because it reduces the budget of the European Parliament by 5.3 million; even though I believe it does not go far enough, it is a reduction. Ideally the vanity project should be wound up and the budget line removed. I voted for Amendment 964 on ITER because I am in favour of reducing the European Union budget, and Amendment 964 was to reduce payments by EUR 490 million. However, I do not support the intent of the author of the amendment which was to eliminate nuclear power. I fully support nuclear power and, if the British people were not sending so much money to Brussels more would be available for investment in the British nuclear industry. I supported Amendment 754 because I oppose EU funds, which are really the taxes of British and European citizens, being used for aid to tobacco producers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Mr President, a 7 % increase for 2013 is outrageous. Does anybody in this House seriously believe that we will help recovery by funding space projects? Why is Galileo still getting EUR 160 million, almost three times more than last year? This is a badly-managed project producing technology that rivals already brought to the market years ago. Why are projects like the Earth monitoring programme and the space research programme getting over EUR 300 million? I can assure you that none of these vanity projects will be putting food on the tables of Europe’s growing number of increasingly angry poor people. Then we have the famous supervisory bodies created a couple of years ago to avoid any more financial scandals. They have not done so. Their reward is EUR 20 million. Would Europe fall apart if all these projects were not funded, along with the EEAS, worth EUR 430 million? Absolutely not. Forget a rise, President; forget a freeze, Mr Cameron. What this ridiculous budget really needs is a cut of at least 10 %. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

 I voted against this proposal and legislative resolution because I believe the common fisheries policy cannot be reformed, least of all by its authors (the Commission). It has caused such damage to the industry and to fish that it is irreformable. I believe that power on this policy, as on others, should be returned to the Member States. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– I voted against the Färm report because my experience with the management and supervision of European funding is not good. Regional funds which require cofinancing are poorly controlled, with responsibility being shirked by the Commission which is ultimately in charge. Project bonds should be a good means to get private funding for these infrastructure projects, but alas, with the EU managing them, I anticipate poor control and indifferent results. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– I voted against draft amending budget number 3/2012, the Balzani report, because my party’s policy is to return unused European funds to the Member States and not to put them aside for future use by the European Union. Member States are having difficult budgets at present and are cutting across the board, even frontline services. At times such as these, there is no excuse for these funds being diverted for the questionable projects of the EU. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, here we go again. In the worst financial crisis in living memory, this House comes up with more unrealistic and irresponsible demands. It simply beggars belief that a majority here can even dare to ask for a 6.8% increase. The idea that genuine growth and employment can be delivered by the EU budget is simply ridiculous. Hundreds of billions have been spent to date that have added up to precisely nothing in terms of growth. Many believe, as I do, that the EU and its policies are, to a large extent, responsible for this crisis. The Commission, in particular, has failed to control the use of EU funding entrusted to it by the taxpayers, while targeting the funds towards supporting its own heavy regulation and the EU project as a whole. Now this House wants to reward this failure with an increase. If you are listening, Mr Cameron, I have a straight-talking message for you: continue to send money to Brussels and you are effectively transferring power to an unelected, irresponsible and hugely wasteful bureaucracy. For goodness sake, give the British people a break and cut our contribution to the EU budget. I am calling for a reduction, not for a freeze. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, an astronomical amount of taxpayers’ money has been given to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain by the EU since 2010: EUR 285 billion. You heard me correctly – EUR 285 billion! What has happened to this money? The EU’s failure to keep tabs on funding means that nobody can know for sure. Now, more money is wanted to waste on promoting deeper European integration. The Lisbon Agenda was a disaster. Can anyone here say that Europe is the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world? Only if they are an ostrich. Now the EU wants to pour billions more into the 2020 plan. The new own resources being proposed, namely the financial transaction tax, mean that this money will be even more unaccountable. This House, in approving this framework, is voting for a continuation of the last ten wasteful years. I shudder at that thought. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, Ms Gomes is wrong. She is talking about something different. The EUR 285 billion is the EU budget that was paid into these Member States. This money is not to be returned and it does not earn any interest. Ms Gomes, you are confused. I am not talking about the bailout. I am talking about the EU budget that was supposed to grow the economies of the countries concerned and did not grow those economies. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, these proposals are a classic case of too little and too late. Greece is under the water and Ireland and Portugal are not far behind. But now Spain, a far larger economy, is having to bail out its own banks. Why should private debt be turned into public debt? Whether the money comes from the EU or from national treasuries, the story remains the same. The people who are now suffering from severe belt-tightening will be the ones who end up paying for the wrong decisions made by private companies. What this Parliament should be demanding is a serious investigation into Spain’s banks, notably Bankia, to understand how a hole of EUR 20 billion could suddenly emerge. Bailing out such banks without investigating how and where the money has gone is an act of irresponsibility and contempt towards European citizens. Enough is enough. We need to call time on this approach. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, we are about to allow the EU to finance itself directly from taxpayers’ pockets without negotiations with anybody, not even the Council. We cannot think that giving the EU tax-raising powers without normal democratic scrutiny is acceptable. It is not. In addition, the legal argument on which this House is trying to base the establishment of an FTT is incorrect. The different sizes of the financial industry in some Member States are not an indication of distorted competition, but rather due to historic developmental differences. This should never have been interpreted as a reason for tax harmonisation. Furthermore, the Commission proposes to tax both sides of the transaction. If one of the parties is not a signatory to the treaty, then the other party would have to raise both amounts. What would then happen to the UK veto? It would be useless. The UK taxpayer would end up paying the tax on all transactions that involved Member States who have signed the treaty. However, it would not enjoy a reduction in its EU contribution as it has not signed up to this treaty. Of course, this House and the Commission must know that as long as the FTT does not become a global tax, the financial sector could move to other, more tax-friendly locations. But they feel the EU can afford the loss of this very important industry. It cannot. (The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8)) Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I have shared my time between the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Petitions, the Committee on the Economic and Financial Crisis and the Policy Challenges Committee. Sometimes, these committees happen to have meetings at the same time. In the last vote on the financial transaction tax, I sent Mr Paška to vote in my place, with my voting list, so in fact my vote was there, and I was represented by somebody else. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Firstly, you would have to prove to me that, in fact, there has not been any relocation away from these countries. I am not sure. I do not have any proof. On the other hand, maybe these countries do not have a similar tax to finance their own budgets. The UK has a stamp duty which it will need to use to finance its own budget. Once this FTT is imposed on the UK, I do not know how the UK is going to finance its budget. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, the procedure whereby we in this House approve the use of the EU budget by the Commission and the other institutions is our greatest responsibility as representatives of the citizens of the Member States. Yet, year after year, while the Court of Auditors fails to give the EU spending a clean bill of health, this House is happy to approve the management’s performance. The auditors’ report for the year 2010 reveals that the error rate – a fine name for the irregular use of funds – has grown from 3.3% to 3.7%. They add that 50% of the transactions sampled were affected by errors. How can we tell taxpayers that their money has been properly spent when we have this situation? Worse, how can we ask taxpayers to put even more into policy areas such as cohesion, energy and transport, where the error rate has increased to an astonishing 7.7%? The increase in the number of agencies from three to 24 in a decade is a matter of concern. The Commission seems to have little control over them, which means that, in the discharge reports, one sees the same stories again and again: conflicts of interest and a revolving door to outside employers at least as efficient as the ones in this building. Yet while this House is prepared to turn a blind eye to the deficiencies of those responsible for most of the budget, including itself, it puts great energy into refusing to approve the management of the Council’s budget. It is not that I want to defend the Council, but this is merely playing politics – and that, in essence, is what the discharge procedure has become, a political game. So, dear taxpayers, nobody actually cares how your money is spent. The solution? Stop sending money to Brussels! Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I am in favour of fusion energy; however, having the EU involved is not the way to achieve it. I voted against the Balzani report on the Draft amending budget no 1 of 2012 because it contributes to the continuation of wasting large amounts of money for a huge, controversial project with a slipping deadline and escalating costs that may never achieve its aim. The ITER agreement was signed in 2006 for a total of EUR 10 billion. It is now already going to cost EUR 15 billion and this figure will probably increase. There is little accountability to taxpayers. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I am not against fusion energy. However, when it comes to ITER, the European Commission should have learned from its mistakes. Unfortunately this never happens. For example, the Galileo project was estimated to cost EUR 7 billion in the year 2000; by 2010 the estimated costs had tripled to EUR 22 billion. The cost continues to climb even further with no real end in sight. The parallels are alarming. ITER’s partners are saying they can only build a stripped-down version of the device by 2018, five years later than the date set in the original agreement. The first experiments intended to validate fusion for power will not take place until the end of 2025. Construction costs are likely to double from the original 2006 estimate of EUR 5 billion to EUR 10 billion. The cost of ITER’s operational phase – another EUR 5 billion over 20 years – may also rise. As 90% of the project is directly managed by the participating states, we are unlikely ever to know what the final costs will be. Taxpayers deserve to know the cost of ITER as they are ultimately paying for it, yet this House continues to approve the financing of a project that has already cost over 50% more than the original estimates. The EU’s approach to public finance is catastrophic. On Monday Commissioner Lewandowski told us that the 2011 payments budget was in surplus to the tune of EUR 1.5 billion, yet a couple of months ago he told us it was short to the amount of EUR 11 billion. Which version is true? Does he not know how much money he has in the bank at the end of each day? I know this and everybody knows this. ITER, like Galileo and the EU budget, is becoming an absurdity, but the taxpayers who are left to foot the bill for these projects are not laughing at all, I can assure you. We should scrap this project altogether. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, this Parliament should not be asking for more money from taxpayers, but less. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund a European History House or other narcissistic projects. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund expensive delegation trips to some paradise island. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund synthetic European political parties. This Parliament does not need more taxpayers’ money to fund communication and advertising campaigns to make itself known to the public. What this Parliament needs is to behave responsibly and act genuinely in the interests of the citizens of the Member States. In this sense, the first thing it should do is to stop burdening Europe’s people with heavy and useless regulation that frequently drives them out of business. The second thing it should do is take the lead in avoiding, condemning and sanctioning all wasteful and irregular use of taxpayers’ funds. I will vote against this budget proposal and urge the British Prime Minister to call for a 10% reduction in the EU budget for the European Parliament for 2013. Marta Andreasen  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
–
 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we already know that billions in taxpayers’ money was wasted in financing the failed Lisbon Agenda, but the EU institutions will never admit their responsibility for helping to create this crisis. Instead, they are asking for more money from EU citizens to finance another failure to come: the 2020 Agenda. This is treating EU citizens as fools. When will this Parliament realise that stimulating growth and jobs requires much less red tape and much less pointless legislation? Why can this Parliament not admit that growth-targeted spending would be best directed at Member State level? Year after year, this Parliament is happy to put more taxpayers’ money in the hands of the Commission, an institution which – as the auditors tell us – is unable to ensure the proper use of EU funding. Of course, the Commission never runs a deficit, and it never will, because it can always go back to the Member States and tax them more to balance its books. If this House refuses to show common sense and responsibility, it will be the architect of its own downfall. I, for one, am calling on the British Government to reduce its contribution to the 2013 EU budget by 10% in comparison with this year’s contribution. However, when it comes to the UK coalition government, I will not be holding my breath. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in the middle of this crisis in which the EU is imposing cuts on Member States, this House still thinks it has the right to ask for inflationary increases. It cannot even agree on what the inflation percentage is but, whether it is 1.9% or 3%, the fact is that this EU bureaucracy is already bloated and needs to go on a hard diet. The cost of this Parliament, which has grown disproportionately, amounts to more than GBP 2 million per MEP. This is not value for money. Entertainment and representation costs have grown by 160% in the last four years. We should do away with this expenditure. The House of European History, with an initial cost estimated in excess of EUR 50 million, and with running costs of more than EUR 11 million per annum, is an extravagance at any time. We should be dropping the whole project. Funding for European political parties and foundations has grown 176% in the last four years. We do not need these European political parties. We MEPs are elected by our constituents or on national party lists. Prime Minister David Cameron is calling for a freeze, but what we need is a significant reduction in this Parliament’s budget and overall, in the whole budget of the European Union, at least a 10% decrease for next year. Without a cut, we are behaving like fat cats. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I voted against this resolution on the EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) because of economic, legal, environmental and moral reasons. The EU and Morocco concluded a FPA on 22 May 2006. An outside consultancy prepared an ex-post evaluation report, on behalf of the European Commission, which evaluates the first four years of the FPA with Morocco. On a general note, it states that ‘the results of this first four-year period of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco are generally rather disappointing’ as the agreement fails to stabilise the EU market and to develop the fisheries sector. Moreover, the population of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi people who suffer under the unlawful and unacceptable occupation of their country by Morocco, does not benefit from this agreement. Morocco has no right to dispose of the natural resources of a territory which does not fall under its sovereignty. For more than 30 years, the Western Sahara’s problem has been dealt with by the United Nations, but without any progress whatsoever. By rejecting the FPA, the European Parliament sent a strong signal to the Moroccan Government that the EU cannot support an agreement with a country which violates human rights. Marta Andreasen,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the European Parliament and the Commission’s demand for a 5% increase for the 2012 budget was ridiculous, but the Council’s acceptance of a real 2% rise is a slap in the face for taxpayers in Europe. In a doomed pursuit of its Lisbon agenda, the EU has squandered more than one trillion euro of taxpayers’ money. I say the number again: one trillion euro. Funds are given to the Commission which fails to properly control their use, and yet it always comes back to us for more. The present economic and financial situation in Europe is, without a doubt, a reflection of the abject failure in the use of funds. While this wasteful spree goes on in Brussels, Mr Osborne in the UK has announced further budget cuts. So I tell the government in the UK today: no, Mr Hague, the EU budget is not under control; no, Mr Cameron, a 2% rise is not a freeze. For goodness sake, stop sending more British taxpayers’ money to the European Union. Marta Andreasen  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, 31, 32, 33 to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, 25 years ago today I went to a football match along with thousands of Liverpool supporters. Ninety-six of us never came home.

 Madam President, one of the three policy options being discussed as a means of addressing problems around the acquisition and preservation of pension rights is legislation at European Union level. Nothing would alarm my constituency in the West Midlands more than this. The use of best practices in a free and competitive market has always ensured the supremacy of the City of London in the financial services sector. Competition and innovation have ensured that British businesses have always led the way. As the workforce becomes more mobile, it is to innovators – not legislators – that we look to find the answers to the new challenges. Innovation creates; legislation stifles. In any case, the idea of having their pensions legislated by the same people who brought us the eurozone crisis would chill the hearts of most British people. My message to the European Commission is this, to parody an old saying: go and legislate on your own doorstep. Hands off our pensions! Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I commend Ms McIntyre for her efforts in this report and I share with her my desire for greater success for small and medium enterprises, and indeed their ability to create jobs. I think in the UK SMEs create up to about 43% of the workforce, the highest ratio. We differ, however, on how to go about it. She obviously believes that she can achieve this from inside the European Union, in what is probably one of her Conservative Party’s many hopes for reform. I feel this is unlikely. In 2009 when I attended, with Mr Bill Benyon, the Federation for Small Businesses (FSB) hustings in Birmingham, the FSB manifesto said, please, no more legislation from the European Union, please cut the red tape. Ms McIntyre, in the two and a half years you have been here you have failed to cut one piece of red tape. And indeed Mr Rübig, who submitted a question, talks about gold-plating. Well, the UK leads on gold-plating and this Conservative government has not done one thing to cut gold-plating. The Conservative government is losing us jobs in Europe. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question

 Mr President, my question is: with unemployment still a problem across Europe, and indeed in the UK, does Mr Farage think it is a fair use of taxpayers’ money – namely his secretarial allowance – not only to employ his wife Kirsten but also his former mistress, Annabelle Fuller? Is this a responsible use of taxpayers’ money, Mr Farage? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his honesty. As he points out, the EU institutions are responsible for the conditions of the economic adjustment programmes that are bringing hardship and despair to so many people. The EU was ill-prepared and ill-equipped to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. It is young people who are suffering the highest levels of unemployment; there is a decline in job quality and a deterioration in basic labour standards. However, it is not just Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus – the countries that have seen their economic governance fall under the control of the Troika – which are affected. My constituency, the West Midlands, has always been an industrial powerhouse, a centre of innovation and manufacturing excellence, but the eurozone crisis, burdensome EU red tape and the relocation of traditional industries to other EU Member States have left us in a situation where unemployment currently stands at 8.1[nbsp ]%, which is above the UK national average. Some 220[nbsp ]000 people in the region are unemployed. To you, that may be just a statistic, but to 220[nbsp ]000 of my constituents and their families – people with a traditionally strong work ethic – it is a tragedy. It spells frustration; it is a shame; it means young people leaving education but seeing no career, no prospects and no future. The Troika is addressing the symptoms of the crisis but we need to look at the cause. The eurozone is bringing us all down. The good news is that, through hard work and inward investment, the number of people unemployed in the West Midlands is falling. But perhaps the biggest boost to our economy will be when, following a referendum, we free ourselves from the economic basket-case that the EU is becoming. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr[nbsp ]President, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is anathema to my constituents. It is promoted as a benefit of the EU, yet we see precious little of the money from the fund – which is, after all, UK taxpayers’ money – being returned to us, and when it does come it is much reduced and has strings attached. One ERDF-funded project is the Coventry Arena. In 2003 Coventry City Council received GBP[nbsp ]4.75[nbsp ]million from the fund. Last June I submitted a freedom-of-information request to the council seeking to ascertain the purpose of the grant. At the same time, I submitted an official question to the Commission seeking the same information. Imagine my surprise when the answers did not match. In fact, they could not be further apart. With other information that has come to my attention in the past year, and given Coventry City Council’s constant refusal to meet me about these discrepancies in funding, I can only conclude that they have something to hide. When the Commission sought clarification of the situation, the council changed its position. Today I can confirm that I am referring the matter to the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, so that it can investigate this use of taxpayers’ money. There is something rotten at the heart of Coventry City Council. Is there something fraudulent as well? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I represent the West Midlands in the United Kingdom where we have had terrible weather conditions. This has caused a tremendous amount of damage through floods, namely in Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.  At the last plenary here in Strasbourg, a Spanish MEP stood up and said he wanted more funds for Spain to deal with weather damage. That is all well and good, but Spain is already a net taker from the European Union. What about my constituents? What about the people in the West Midlands who do not get any of this emergency fund? I am concerned about them. I am concerned about the impact on their lives.  The UK pays GDP[nbsp ]52 million a day to the European Union. When do we get our share back? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, this is a procedural point of order. President Schulz and, I believe, the Conference of Presidents have made it clear that if you are on a speaking list, you cannot have a blue card.

 Madam President, since the Estrela report was voted on in the European Parliament, I have received more correspondence from constituents on this report than almost any other. It is of course a vital policy area that affects us all as individuals and as a society. It is also an area in which certain groups may be particularly vulnerable. This includes those in developing nations, the economically-disadvantaged and the poorly-informed or educated, and those women who live in societies in which women are treated unequally or even regarded simply as property. Through my work on the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, I have witnessed such situations at first hand. There are important debates to be had: access to contraception, sexual health, education and healthcare, and abortion are just some of the issues. It will also come as a surprise to learn that in several countries in the EU the age of consent is as low as fourteen. These debates must include all actors in society – not just politicians, but also healthcare professionals, teachers, parents and, given the moral implications, the Church. The Church should not be made an enemy. The Estrela report, however, appears to be dominated by a political agenda and in my opinion is unacceptable. That is why I could not support it, as I believe this to be a national competence. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). - 
 Madam President, this is the first point of order: when an MEP asks for a procedural point of order, the President must give way. I think this is in the Rules of Procedure, and you failed to do that. I am actually calling for you to suspend this debate and put in place a chair who can competently take this debate. This has been absolute chaos. Your absolute bigoted bias in this debate has been absolutely disgraceful. Please vacate the chair and put someone else more competent in. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is poignant that Greece should take over the Presidency at this time. Greece is the living embodiment of the failure of the Troika and indeed the euro project. Mr Samaras, you talk about the mistakes of your country over decades. Surprisingly, you failed to put any blame where it truly belongs, namely on the pro-federalising Eurocrats who ignore the Maastricht convergence criteria to push on with their project of a federal Euro-state. Linking the Greek economy with such a powerhouse as Germany was utter madness, and your people paid the price – not least with a suicide rate that increased by 46 %. In your speech you stated that your first commitment was to ever-closer EU integration. Are you not learning from the lessons of history? Are you not condemned to relive them? You cannot play political make-believe with people’s lives. Your people and people across Europe came out onto the streets to show their displeasure at the medication for the Eurocrats’ mental illness. Greece is the birthplace of democracy, and this year people across Europe will have the chance to put a dagger in the heart of the European Union. A significant number of these people have plenty of time to go to the polling station as they are unemployed, a core failure of the EU project. Mr Samaras, you are in make-believe land if you think the EU is the solution. In the UK we also have a leader who lives in make-believe land and who believes that he can renegotiate serious powers from the EU before a referendum. But we have heard this con trick before. The British people have waited far too long to have the choice to leave this corrupt and doomed mess that is the EU. In May’s elections we will let the people decide. We will put the option on the ballot paper in Britain for the people to demand a referendum now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, as a member of the Chilean delegation I visited Chile last year. I am quite happy with the Free Trade Agreement we have with Chile, and I agree that Chile has proved itself to be a strong and reliable trade partner. Great strides forward have been made in Chile with respect to human rights. It is now a fully functioning democracy and has put aside all its past troubles, but I think we must be very strong with the human rights element throughout Latin America.  I attend lots of talks where people ask me about Free Trade Agreements, as they wonder what exactly they are and I have to tell them. They ask if the United Kingdom would not have a Free Trade Agreement if it left the European Union. That is a good question, because here we are with a Free Trade Agreement with countries on the other side of the world, yet the threat to the people that I represent is that if you leave the EU you would not have a Free Trade Agreement. I think it is probably relevant that I make the point here in the Chamber at some point, so I have done so tonight. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, well, here we are still in very great economic hardship across the continent, and what does the European Union decide to discuss at the top of the agenda for a Council meeting? Defence. I would argue that across Europe – not just the United Kingdom – defence is way down the list of people's concerns and of what they want to discuss. They want to discuss employment, they want to discuss how much it costs them to live, growing inflation, but that is not what you want to talk about. You want to talk defence. We have heard the Commission here talking about competing with the USA. Why would you want to compete with the USA? We are 28 sovereign nations. There is no will, in the United Kingdom at least, to be one sovereign nation called the European Union. You have to have the consent of people, but you do not want that. You want to move forward in this one superstate. We should not be competing with the USA. We should be working with the USA. Why do we want to reinvent the wheel? We have NATO and NATO is tried and tested. We need to reinvigorate NATO. That is what we need to do.  And employment? And the euro? You are congratulating yourself because Latvia is joining. You have had sticking plaster over sticking plaster on your euro single currency and the wound has congealed, and you are putting another one on with Latvia. But we all know what happens when you leave a plaster on. The wound becomes infected and when you finally have to remove that plaster, it is far more painful – and that is as good an analogy as I have for the euro. It will be a painful, slow decline and, when it finally rips apart, it will hurt and it will hurt the people of Europe. Stop this madness now. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, the European Social Fund’s remit is to invest in people and to support employment, especially amongst the young who see their futures receding in a Europe of austerity and unemployment. I know the EU food aid programme, the Fund for European Aid for the Most Deprived, is also to receive its funding through the ESF.  In my constituency of the West Midlands, my office has collected over three tonnes of food for distribution to food banks. Across the country, more than 350 000 people are dependent on these food banks to feed themselves and their families. It has been estimated that if current trends continue, more than half a million people could be receiving food parcels by 2016. These are basic supplies, not luxury foods and wine such as those that will be enjoyed in the Members’ dining room today. A recent study found that malnutrition is on the rise in the UK. One in ten older people are malnourished. This fact is a warning sign and it is where the problem first becomes apparent. The Archbishop of Canterbury just three days ago insisted on a plea for more financial support for the rapidly expanding network of food banks. We see it here debating new legislation whilst people are suffering back home. There is a joke that is popular in England at the moment. President Barroso is asked by a Greek citizen: Have we achieved full European integration? The answer from Barroso is: Oh no, it will get a lot worse yet. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, we certainly need more women in our boardrooms. We certainly need more women in politics. There can be no doubt about that. The question is how we go about it. I do not believe, Ms Reding, that your proposals will help the situation. I think that, on the contrary, they will make it worse. Women business leaders tell me that, actually, they do not want to be put on boards by patronising laws. They want to be put there on merit. Now, speaking as someone who has been discriminated against, I think all forms of discrimination are wrong, as is positive discrimination, because positive discrimination is discrimination, and discrimination creates victims. It does not matter what gender you are: if you believe in equality and you create discrimination, you create a victim. Ms Reding, do not legislate to make victims. That is not what you are in your job to do. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, businesses – small, medium and large – have been contacting me in their droves about this much-vaunted EU investment, this mythical EU money that the pro-European argument says the UK is so heavily dependent on. Let us put aside the argument that EU money actually does not exist. The fact is that there have been no calls, from 2000 onwards, for grants. This is because delays in agreeing budgets have led to indecision and confusion over such EU funds. Civil society, the bedrock of democracy, is promised EU grants, but again there has been too much uncertainty and, more disastrously, inaction. I note, on the other hand, that the EU is not too slow when taking our money – our taxpayers’ money – but is too arrogant and negligent in throwing back some crumbs. No wonder the people of the United Kingdom have decided – and want to decide in a referendum – that they no longer want to be part of this sham and that they want to spend their money in the United Kingdom, not propping up some failing countries across Europe.

Mr President, this is on a point of order which I will come to, but as a Member representing the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom where Malala now resides and where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, I congratulate this remarkable young woman who is deserving of this prize.  My point of order is quite significant. It is incredibly disappointing that you disrespected this Chamber and that the announcement was not made here live. It was announced on Twitter 30 minutes ago. I think you Mr President have disrespected this Chamber by announcing it on Twitter before doing so in this Chamber. (Mixed reactions) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, I would question the title of this debate about the Rise of right-wing extremism in Europe. Surely it should be about ‘extremism’. Commissioner Reding, I know your desire for equality, maybe you can tell us when we are going to debate ‘left-wing’ extremism, just in the name of equality. A key dynamic in politics is the relationship between the centre and the periphery. The centre, where power lies, in a truly democratic society is in a constant state of flux as opinion, debate and events filter to the centre and shift our values and priorities; this is very healthy. However, if those in power at the centre refuse to listen to the people whose concerns may be inconvenient, then by ignoring them they push them further out towards the periphery. They push them towards the extremes. Extreme thought, extreme speech and, ultimately, extreme acts.  It is no surprise to political observers in Britain that the far right only ever takes seats from the left: our Labour party, not the Conservative party. When Prime Minister Gordon Brown infamously labelled the respectable Labour voter, Gillian Duffy, as a bigot – simply for expressing genuine concerns about immigration and economic policy that differed to his own – he became a recruiting sergeant for extremists.  The blame for the rise of extremism lies at the feet of the political class that refuses to take account of the opinions and concerns of the electorate and the people to whom they should be accountable.

Madam President, well, here we go again. Squirm time for the European bureaucrats. They must really hate this, having to answer and put forward their figures because, seriously, they do not like scrutiny and they do not like transparency. This whole report lacks scrutiny, and it lacks transparency in the withholding of documents relating to significant expenditure – namely the purchase of the Residence Palace in Brussels, as previously mentioned – and in the refusal of the Council to address questions raised by a democratically-elected Parliament. A democratically elected Parliament! Her Majesty’s Government has drawn attention in the last few days to a cosy agreement in place since the 1970s, that two institutions would not scrutinise each other’s spending. Why are you so afraid of democratic scrutiny? You control Europe, you spend taxpayers’ money, your accounts for the whole of this institution have not been audited for 18 years and you do not care about democracy. I told my constituents in the West Midlands, the industrial heartland of the United Kingdom about this. I am not sure that they actually believed me. Incidentally, we British have a name for opaque and cosy arrangements such as these. We call them Spanish practices. I am very pleased that the rapporteur advocates voting against discharge of the 2011 budget. Of course, any agreement for scrutiny of another institution should be mutual. I would welcome scrutiny of this institution’s spending by the Council and I think the people of Great Britain would also welcome it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I am amazed that we have had this State of the Union address today. I am surprised that Mrs Merkel has not asked us to postpone it until after the German general election. Well, Mr Barroso, this was your fourth and last State of the Union address and you have brought along the rest of your appointed Commission – for support. Never before has a tier of this Parliament been filled with such incompetence and failure. A question, why is it that it is the President of the unelected arm of the EU that gives this address? Why is it not President Schulz? One Member of your Commission is here today, despite only having an attendance record of 52%, almost as low as a UKIP MEP. Your flagship policy, when you became President, was the much-vaunted Lisbon Strategy which seeks to make the EU the most dynamic economy in the world. That sank without trace. In fact the EU has gone into reverse. Unemployment, especially among youth, is rocketing and little Miss Red Tape sitting next to you is not helping. Mr Barroso, your own Commission’s poll shows there is no trust in the EU. The people of the biggest five countries feel the EU is not working. Two-thirds of people across the EU think their views are not being heard. No wonder – but when they do express an opinion, for example in a rare referendum, they are treated with contempt and told that somehow they do not understand. The arrogance is palpable. The people must be listened to. Let the people decide. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I was extremely disappointed that Mr Barroso did not answer my main question: why it should be he, the unelected representative of an EU institution, giving the State of the Union address rather than the elected representative, Mr Schulz. Maybe you could help me on this point, Mr Barroso? We do not agree on much, and I do not agree with your vision of a united Europe, but I do agree with you, Mr Barroso, that if the club is going to prosper, if it is going to work, you need all the members inside working towards that. I need to ask you then: why do you not challenge the UK to put up or shut up? Why do you go along with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, pretending that he can renegotiate to recover powers from the European Union? Are you saying that he can renegotiate certain items from the Treaty of Rome? Can you just make it clear, once and for all, that renegotiation of significant powers such as the Social Chapter is not possible? Is it not damaging to the European Union to have the UK in its current predicament until 2017? Is it not time for the UK and its people to decide, sooner rather than later, whether they want the country to remain a member of the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, these elections have had progressively lower turnouts, election by election. In fact the electorate is generally voting on national issues, which shows that the plan for a federal Europe does not really have public consent, does it? Even where there have been referendums, you federalists have been defeated until you have made the voters vote again. You do not care about the voters of Europe, do you? Mr Duff, the British press has today carried criticism of your plan for pan-European political parties to participate in our elections. What you clearly do not understand is that the people do not want this. Latvian accession to the single currency was approved today by this Parliament, despite an admission in the – appropriately named – Balz report that the Latvian people do not really want it. You talk in the report about citizens being ‘directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament’. They already are represented by Members they have voted for, but the traditional view of a democratic representative is not good enough for you, is it, Mr Duff? Of course this is not what we really want, is it? What you want, Mr Duff, is for citizens to be represented by people who agree with your own federalist vision of Europe. The people may not want that, Mr Duff, but what does that really matter to you? What we need is a referendum about our membership of the European Union. That is what the people of the United Kingdom want. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, medical practitioners will know the acronym FTT well. It stands for ‘failure to thrive’. The idea of imposing new taxes on European business at a time of economic hardship and rising unemployment has been described as perverse and unacceptable by the former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. But this is not an economic decision, is it? This is a political project. Even Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, stated recently that the FTT posed a very real risk to the economy, confirming the observation by Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, that even amongst the 11 Member States that agreed to press forward, there is not unqualified support.  For a financial transaction tax to work, it would have to be global, as its proposer, James Tobin, stated, but do we think for one minute that the G20 would be prepared to follow the lead of the people who inflicted the euro area on the world? Tomorrow we will vote on whether to allow Latvia to buy the last ticket on the Titanic. This tax must never be allowed to set sail. It should be strangled at birth. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I contend that the EU is the sick man of the developed world, as much mentally ill as physically. The EU leaders meet for another late-night supper, then adjourn to the drawing room for their usual game of economic bluff, while quislings put together some incoherent mumbo-jumbo communiqué. The idea of the game is simple: to let all 27 leaders leave with some credibility and be able to say that something has been won for their countries. In the UK we know that the game is EU deception: a game our last eight Prime Ministers have played in Brussels. The real losers are the people of Europe, who pay for this late-night folly. Some ex-players of the game, such as former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, have now said that it is time the UK left the EU. Of course he was rounded on by Europhile business leaders coming out with the usual tripe about UK trade being affected. I wholeheartedly agree with his response on the BBC this week, when he called them economic illiterates. We know about these scaremongering stories; during the single currency debate of the late 1990s, Nissan warned that they would remove their investment from the UK if we did not join the euro. Well, they did not. In fact they invested more.  I suggest a new game for Thursday night called ‘reality’, where Europe’s leaders realise that their beloved Europe federal project has failed and that the single currency is unsustainable without the express consent of the people of Europe to federalising steps, and understand that the people of the UK no longer wish to subsidise your pie-in-the-sky projects whilst they are suffering crippling cut-backs at home. I understand that the best treatment for mental illness is accepting the illness and accepting reality. I commend it to you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, it is wonderful that Heads of Government and Heads of State come here to set out their agenda, and dialogue is never a bad thing. However, I think there is one notable exception, or rather one person who has not come here who has a lot to say about Europe. That is the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who reckons he can renegotiate, for example, the Social Chapter. Is it not about time that he came to this Chamber and explained what he really meant, so that we, the elected representatives of people across Europe, could see whether the UK actually could renegotiate its terms of membership? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Madam President, many of my colleagues here today have called for one voice for the European Union, indeed one mentioned ambassadors rather than heads of delegation. But surely that needs some type of federalism? The European Union does not have a mandate for that. That is why, in my view, the EEAS is fundamentally flawed. I am sure it is a big problem for Baroness Ashton to carry out her duties when she cannot speak for all 27 nations. But I cannot help the feeling that she is part-author of her own problems. Of course she was leader of the Lords when she pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, when she argued there was no fundamental change of power. And here she is in fact really wanting more power. So which was it, Baroness Ashton? You know, you cannot have it both ways. The only way that the EU can actually speak with one voice is if it gives a mandate from the people. One specific question that I would really like you to answer this afternoon: in what capacity, Baroness Ashton, were you at the Champions League final this year? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, while I welcome this debate about poverty in Europe, I think that using EU funding to tackle domestic poverty issues is highly unfair to the taxpayers of those few countries that actually make significant contributions to the EU budget. In the UK, there is a growing resentment towards those Member States that are seen as being takers. It is deeply regrettable that the UK, with its great tradition of helping those less fortunate than itself, has a growing resentment about funding this or that EU project while British people are suffering crippling cutbacks at home. No wonder more and more people are turning against the European Union. Only last week, the leading philanthropist Bill Gates, a regular visitor to the European Parliament, congratulated the United Kingdom on its remarkable record in foreign aid – a record, incidentally, that the EU likes to piggyback on and take credit for.  This report acknowledges that Member States should take responsibility for issues of poverty and social inclusion, and that the fund for European aid and the most deprived should not be seen as replacing those responsibilities. But what message is being sent out by the call for an increased budget for the fund for 2014-2020? Who will supply this extra money: the 200 000 British citizens who are dependent on food banks in order to feed their families, or the growing army of unemployed youth? The economic crisis, largely the fault of the eurozone, is now so bad that we have to say charity begins at home. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, 1.3 million families – that is one in four families in England – are on lower incomes. They have to spend a third of their net income on housing, largely owing to the shortage of private rental sector housing, which was exacerbated in the 1980s by the Conservative Party’s failure to build social housing programmes and the Labour Party of the 1990s failing to tackle that issue. I am glad that this is a national competence, and it should stay a national competence. However, the EU has a detrimental impact. We currently have a government in the United Kingdom saying that it does not know how many people who will be coming from Romania and Bulgaria, or indeed from across the European Union. How are our local authorities supposed to make provision when current provision does not meet demands? This is why we have problems of people in the private sector not being able to afford housing on a third of their income – some GBP 500 in Coventry. That is not affordable, and we cannot provide this any longer. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Madam President, one word: ‘consistency’. I will repeat it again so that the interpreters get it to you in time: ‘consistency’. I have been here four years, and not once have I been told that you have to have the question in before the start of the process. This is the first time this has happened. If this is the case, then you should announce it before the votes even begin. It was my understanding that you had to have your request for a question in before the subject or report was brought up. It is a complete inconsistency, and you are denying me my full mandate by not allowing me my explanation of vote on this report, so I ask you once again to give me my explanation of vote because you are denying me my mandate.

Mr President, I have heard of the carrot and stick approach, but I have never heard of the carrot and carrot approach. That seems to be the EU’s relationship with Turkey. It seems to give, give, give.  Can I remind this institution that the Cypriots held the Presidency in the latter part of 2012 and Turkey point blank refused to actually have anything to do with them, although they were a candidate country. Well if the candidate country does not want to have anything to do with its Presidency, surely the candidature should be ceased there and then.  The people of Cyprus are held hostage by the invaders and occupiers of northern Cyprus. The people of Morphou last November, together with myself, attempted to visit their town and were refused free access to their old town by the Turkish authorities. The people of Kyrenia wished to celebrate a religious service in their town over the coming Easter and have been refused by the Turkish authorities.  Baroness Ashton is being her usual, useless self and is unable to help. Is it not about time we got real on Turkey? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, first of all I would like to express my agreement with the comment made about the Boston bombing. I send my condolences to the victims and their families, and my best wishes to the injured. Terrorism must not, and will never, succeed. The debate is about the future of the European Union, and I must say that I normally struggle to make my case in a minute, but such a debate is a very short one. What future does it have? Is it like the Soviet empire that had a blatant disregard for its people, which ignores it opinions and fails to give referendums – and when it does, it ignores the result and then calls for other referendums? Does it steal the savings of ordinary people, like it did in Cyprus? Does it disregard an occupying force in North Cyprus, even though it is part of the European Union – which unbelievably has the status of Nobel Prize Winner? Is this the future of the European Union? No. The future of the European Union is doomed. It is doomed to failure. It does not have a democratic mandate. You are frightened of the people. The European Union is failing, and that is why the UK needs to be out of it soon. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, a week ago we lost a great political figure, a woman who achieved the highest office in the land from humble beginnings – in fact, the first elected woman in the western world. Incidentally she achieved that without the need of a quota, something which this House believes so firmly in. When she took office, the United Kingdom was the sick man of Europe, but her strong policies, handling of the economy and dealing with trade unions – a lesson which the French and Germans still have not learnt in thirty years – transformed the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The President, Mr Schultz, called her a great European. She did believe in the membership of the European Community and she signed the Single European Act, but when she realised it was getting into a federal Europe and a single currency she said, ‘No, no, no’, and that is why the cowards stabbed her in the back. From a personal point of view she inspired me into politics. I was ten when she was elected and I met her just three months before I was elected, and when I told her that I was coming here to fight for British independence from the European Union she told me never to give up, never to give up, and I can assure you I will never give up fighting for my country’s independence.

blue-card question
. – 
Mr President, my colleague talks about integrity, but maybe he would like to comment on the integrity of the EU in its last foray into professional football – the Bosman ruling – which I would say has probably caused some of the problem.  What it has done is taken the wealth from a lot of the smaller clubs and transferred it to the bigger clubs and created overpaid footballers, and underpaid footballers at a grassroots level. That is where the people who are involved in organised crime are actually attacking lower paid footballers. It is in the lower leagues that this match-fixing is taking place. The Bosman ruling – an EU ruling – has created that problem. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
). -  
Mr President, this issue is close to my heart, as a lover of sport and a football season-ticket holder and sponsor of football at all levels, including grassroots. It is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Some people like to call it the beautiful game. Clearly, we are learning that football is becoming noticeably more grubby and sullied. According to experts, as many as ten matches a week in Europe are now affected by match-fixing. The numbers of games affected worldwide is astonishing.  However, it is not enough to look at this issue from a purely European perspective. Can we trust the EU Commission, with its history of corruption, to clear up sport? Maybe it is a ‘poacher turned gamekeeper’.  Match-fixing is an endemic problem across the world. Until nations and football authorities get their houses in order, how can we expect anything to change? Take a look at FIFA, for example, a body that has been dogged by accusations of corruption; or the FA back in my own country that fails to implement a working fit-and-proper-persons test, which allows vulnerable clubs to fall into the wrong hands.  Many of the players that get caught up in match-fixing accusations are often poorly paid, poorly educated and poorly protected. It is not enough for Europol to investigate this problem. UEFA has far more member countries than the EU, so proposed EU action would be an irrelevance. It is about time that we had transparent football authorities and legislation from national governments to stamp out this organised crime in football once and for all. I believe football can be beautiful again. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 I voted against this report not because I do not want to decrease the amount of MEPs far from it. I actively campaign for my own redundancy and the other 72 UK MEPs. I voted for the previous defeated amendment to call for the matter to be referred to an Independent body to determine to size and make-up of future parliaments. Politicians should not determine alone how they are to be elected. Also, this report allows for enlargement. Something I am opposed to. The EU cannot deal with itself at the moment let alone getting larger. To those countries that will lose an MEP, they should not worry, when the UK leaves they will have 73 seats to redistribute.

Mr President, once again Europe’s leaders will meet for a late night supper. The agenda may talk of growth and jobs, but we have heard it all before and nothing improves. Only lip service will be paid to jobs and growth. The real conversation over the foie gras will be how to save your beloved political project of European federalisation. The talk will be about how to keep Italy in line after its comical election and how to downplay yet another country, Cyprus, seeking a new bailout. British people know that problems come from Europe and they pay for them with cold, hard cash and the reduction of essential public services. British people are getting more and more fed up with the European Union. May I take this opportunity to thank Mr Barroso for helping with this. Despite Mr Cameron’s attempts to knock a referendum into the long grass, the British people demand a referendum on our membership now. My constituents send a clear message to my office, week in, week out, which is that they do not want anything more to do with this corrupt and doomed mess that is the European Union.

Mr President, in a dispute where up to 70 000 people have been killed and a million refugees have fled the country since the crisis began two years ago, the question must be posed: what good is Baroness Ashton? What is her highly expensive and ineffective EEAS achieving to alleviate the situation? The answer is very little, just typical EU lip-service – or you are an expensive lipstick, Mrs Ashton. Your authority is highly questionable. You represent 27 nations who have different outlooks. You have been heavily criticised here today by members of all political groups. Indeed, Mr Cameron said the UK was still an independent country when threatening to veto an EU extension to the arms embargo. What does that make you? Redundant? The situation in Syria is deplorable. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has today visited a UN refugee camp in Jordan and described the situation as heart-breaking. What will you do? Will you at least begin by putting Hezbollah on the list of terrorist organisations? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, not a single sane person in this Chamber would disagree with me when I say that the common agricultural policy needs reforming.  The EU needs to reduce intervention to a genuine safety net, move towards a market-orientated approach and the end of a situation whereby farmers chase subsidies and not markets – the old-style CAP market production box marked ‘Failed projects’ it should be confined to.  What reform are we really going to see here? We have been talking about this for two years, and a quarter of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development opposed the report. What message does that send to the farming sector? Both environmentalists and farmers alike are highly critical of the green aspects of these proposals. How then can the public believe that their environmental concerns have been addressed? I believe that the people who are best qualified to look after the British landscape are the British farmers, not unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. The CAP is expensive and over-bureaucratised, and farmers in my constituency constantly contact me about this. It adds to the weekly food bill of every family in Great Britain. Professor Patrick Minford of Cardiff Business School, a leading critic of the CAP, is on record as stating that the average family would be much better off if we left the European Union, not only in terms of cheaper food.

Mr President, I have a question for my colleague. He has talked about potential national interest and each Member’s country not wanting to lose one. We have also had a slight accusation against my colleague, Mr Duff, that he may be doing it for political purposes. Does this not show that politicians should not determine how politicians are elected? The EU employs far more bureaucrats than necessary. Should it not be done without politicians making these decisions and just determined by independent bodies, as is done in the UK? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, democracy is far from perfect. While I feel that there should be some protection for some smaller countries, I think it is only fair to inform you that my country, the United Kingdom, is greatly under-represented. In fact, I represent a region, the West Midlands, which has some 5 million people. At the last election, six of us were elected, so that was about 900 000 people each.  We have Maltese MEPs and Luxembourgish MEPs, with populations of half a million also returning six MEPs. Now, I make a great effort in communicating with my constituents, but my allowances have to stretch to 5 million people, whereas an MEP from Luxembourg or Malta – with only 500 000 and a much smaller geographical area – is put at great advantage. I do not think that is taken into consideration. (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, this is a rather difficult subject, and I would say at the outset that I do not blame any immigrants who want to try and make a better life for themselves. What I do feel is that the politicians have let down the immigrants and the settled community. In 2004, when the Eastern Bloc countries joined the EU, our Labour Government told us that we would only have 14 000 people coming into the UK. Well, it hit over a million people. How were our local service providers – our National Health Service, our housing – able to plan ahead for that? Next year, we face more people coming from Bulgaria and Romania. How are our social services in the United Kingdom, which are already cut to the bone, and our taxpayers, who are paying more money, supposed to support that? It simply does not work. I am glad to see that our own government is beginning to take a stance on this, but even it cannot tell us how many people are coming next year. That is a fundamental problem with planning for social services in the United Kingdom. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

You acted beyond your responsibilities in not taking my point of order earlier.

Austerity is detrimental to disabled people (8 % of the UK population), who are finding themselves in a worst position of poverty than ever before. In the UK we have endured constant reassessments of the work capability assessment, which has led to the deaths and suicides of 73 disabled people per week. It is abhorrent that 29 % of the cuts are focused on disabled people. Fewer people are entitled to support from their local authorities, and we will see the introduction of personal independence payments to replace disability living allowance, which is set to knock over half a million people off support. There is also a proposal to close the Independent Living Fund permanently. The proposal by the government is to transfer monies to cash strapped local authorities; which are already saying that they will institutionalise disabled people, to save money. These are just some of the cuts impacting on disabled people in the UK, estimated to take GBP 9 billion from the poorest in society. No wonder British people are sick and tired of the EU. We have a saying ‘Charity begins at home’. Britain needs to look after its vulnerable people and not be hampered by sending GBP 53 million every day to the EU. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I really do have to admit I would love to be a fly on the wall in this Friday’s EU Budget talks in Brussels. I would like to see the discomfort of Mr Cameron as he walks into the room, the tension in his neck at the thought that he has to confront Mr Hollande and his colleagues throughout Europe. He has put referenda back on the agenda and he is going to have to sit down and fight for the British interest. He says he wants a renegotiation, but President Schulz has already told this Parliament that renegotiation is not possible. Mr Verhofstadt told the BBC renegotiation is not possible, so who is going to give? Are they going to be shown to be fools, or is Mr Cameron going to be shown to be a fool? I think Mr Cameron is trying to pull a Houdini act here. He is trying to appease the Eurosceptic majority in the UK, while trying to appease the European Union. This Houdini act is bound to fail and he will be shown to be more like Tommy Cooper.  My constituents tell me they do not want GBP 53 million spent in the EU. That money is better spent at home.

 Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague why she does not think the expenditure in this Parliament is too great. Two years ago the entertainment budget for MEPs or for Parliament went up 80%. Do you not think that was a substantial increase? In December, in the courtyard here in Strasbourg, we saw extortionate expenditure on television screens and posters that are still there about celebrating the Sakharov Prize. In that week each Member of Parliament and each member of staff was given probably five, six or seven pieces of chocolate. Do you not think that was unnecessary expenditure? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I used to go back and tell my constituents that this was the institution that knew no cutbacks. In my first few years as an MEP the allowances just went up and up and up and up. We all got a new member of staff for Lisbon; the attendance allowance went up from EUR 296 to EUR 304 euros. I have already mentioned that the entertainment budget went up 82%; everything just went up and up and up.  As we go towards 2014 you decided to make some minor cutbacks, forgetting what you paid in the first few years. You ignored reality for far too long and now you are wondering what to do. You are making the poor staff here suffer through no fault of their own on account of your political meddling. What about cutting Ms Ashton’s EEAS? What does it actually do? What about cutting that back? What about the shiny new offices for Mr Van Rompuy and Ms Cathy Ashton? And what about the bigger argument as to whether we should be here in Strasbourg? And what about Fridays here in Strasbourg? There are still 80 to 100 MEPs that come here on a Friday morning and sign in and go home when there is no official business. That is about EUR 30 000 month; should that not be cut out for a start? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, corporate social responsibility is a policy concept whereby businesses self-regulate in order to operate in an ethical and sustainable manner in order to understand and meet the needs and expectations of all stakeholders. In this report, however, this concept has been transformed into a jumble of slogans and key words seemingly intended to tick all the right boxes without explaining how exactly anything is to be actually achieved.  The concept of self-regulation has gone from this report and has seemingly been replaced by vague calls for Commission strategies, Commission guidelines, even concrete proposals from the Commission for the implementation of corporate socially responsible practices. The rapporteur – even if now he wants businesses, enterprises, to be responsible for solving social issues caused by the economic crisis – believes that the economic crisis has shaken employees’ faith in corporations to meet their pension obligations. No, Mr Howitt, it is the EU and the eurozone crisis that has done that.  This report flits from subcontracting to low carbon technology and to gender equality in the blink of an eye. The rapporteur calls for the launch of a new EU initiative on advancing materiality. He wants the EU to back a proposal for a UN convention on corporate responsibility. More bureaucracy is the last thing that businesses need at this time. The report refers to short-term thinking in Brussels in one breath and with the next it calls on the Commission to show leadership. It takes a concept based on self-regulation by wide, diverse and economic actions in 27 Member States and seeks to turn it into an EU competence where one size will not fit at all. It reads like a student manifesto, a first-year student manifesto. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, let us rewind a little. Before you roll out your latest grandiose plan, let us take a look back. Do you remember the Lisbon Agenda? Let me refresh your memory. It was adopted for a ten-year period in 2000 by the European Council. It broadly aimed to make Europe, by 2010, the most competitive and the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. How did that go for you? Not well. You replaced it with another plan. Now your beloved political project is in dire straits. Millions across Europe are in despair, and now you are scurrying around looking for another plan. You cannot accept the political reality that your project is fundamentally flawed. Your foundations are as strong as the blancmange that I had for dessert last night. Whilst the euro sails into the rocks, the three presidents grandstand with the Nobel Prize. Did Nelson Mandela grandstand in the same manner? Did Barack Obama? No. They had dignity, and we are not seeking to create some useful diversion to problems so destructive to the peoples of Europe. No wonder the people of the UK demand a referendum to have their say on this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I would congratulate my colleague on her speech, which was very strong and meaningful. But when she talks about the peace process, would she not agree with me that one of the main barriers to the peace process is Hamas’s refusal to recognise the state of Israel? She failed to mention that at all. That is really the first step towards peace and a two-state solution in this matter. I invite her to call on Hamas to recognise the state of Israel. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, is it not deeply ironic in a debate about democracy that this Parliament is using rules to actually stifle debate? We are not allowed to use blue cards or catch-the-eye, which means that very small entities such as the non-attached Members get no speaking time at all. Of course we will all be standing in elections in 2014. You did say at the start of the debate that there would be no catch-the-eye, but you did not say, and it has not previously been put in any of the material or by e-mail, that there would be no blue cards. I think that is a real breach of this debate and shows the EU to be what it is: it talks about democracy but it does not want to let everyone have their say or even their vote. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, my constituents will not be too surprised to learn that their hard-earned money taken by taxes and passed on to the EU is being negligently handed out by the net recipients of the EU budget. In a week when many Member States are seeking an increase in the EU budget to just over EUR one trillion, my constituents in the UK say this is unacceptable in a time of austerity. The blame for the failure to have the audit signed off for the 18th year lies firmly at the door of the unelected bureaucrats of the EU. They have failed the taxpayers of Europe once again. I note that 60 % of the errors found by the Court could have been detected by Member States, yet it is the quagmire of rules and unnecessary complications that is at fault. And what is the EU doing to correct this? It is not even notifying the Member States concerned of the direct problems. One of the examples of the billions wasted is the EUR 700 million to establish the rule of law and reduce corruption in Kosovo, but the results are poor according to the report. Staff delegated were not even sufficiently trained, yet the EU thinks that by throwing in taxpayers’ money without reasonable constraint it can solve the problem. And what about pan-European parties? What about public financing of political parties such as the right-wing extremist parties to which some UKIP Members have signed up, some Nazis – what about the financing of that? A colleague of mine talked about confidence. Well, the people of the UK have less and less confidence in the EU, which is why we need an in-or-out referendum, sooner rather than later. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, I can say with some certainty that, in times of austerity, my constituents do not want their taxes spent on political campaigns and propaganda. I voted against these proposals that seek to further the use of pan-European parties, with all their expense and their ideology of promoting EU federalism. The majority of people in the UK do not share an EU identity. In successive EU elections, people have used the elections to express their disapproval of the EU. Opinion poll after opinion poll shows dissatisfaction with the EU and a wish for a referendum. My constituents do not wish to hear propaganda, paid for by their taxes, telling them how great the EU is. They feel the reality of cutbacks in public services, whilst the UK pays more and more to the EU – a luxury we cannot afford. In 2014 the We Demand a Referendum Party will put on the ballot paper those words, ‘We demand a referendum’. This will allow the electorate from the UK to send you, and our government, a message, loud and clear, that we demand an in-out referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, once again we have a summit that promises a solution but in the fullness of time delivers little but further EU integration. Through the fault of unelected, incompetent Eurocrats and blinded Member State leaders, the financial crisis is being used as a tool for further EU integration. What a heavy price we are paying for the Eurocrats’ fantasy of a United States of Europe. Have they learned nothing from their folly? President Barroso and his apparatchiks care little for the ordinary person. This latest round has been done on the back of the Greek collapse and the 43 % increase in the suicide rate there. My fear is for the UK which, despite being out of the eurozone, is seemingly unaffected. Yet this deal fails to safeguard the City of London and its prosperity. David Cameron has given the green light to banking union and got nothing in return. Why? Was this not the opportunity to renegotiate some of those powers back from the European Union, as Cameron endlessly promises? It shows his words to be empty and that once again we have a Conservative Party which talks tough on Europe, with its sprinkling of Judas goats. But Cameron turns out to be nothing more than the German Chancellor’s poodle. Three out of four Conservative voters want an ‘in or out’ referendum but are being deceived by their leadership, which continues to sleepwalk the UK into a federal Europe. So I call on those Conservative supporters to stand up to David Cameron for the future of your party and for our country. Send him a loud message: we demand a referendum. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I recently spent some time in Cyprus, taking part in anti-occupation events against the illegal Turkish occupation, which has now been going on for 38 years. Turks hold 38 % of Cypriot lands when Cyprus is actually part of the European Union. It was while I was in Cyprus that I learned that the European Union had won the Nobel Peace Prize. That may be a joke, but not for the people of Cyprus. Part of that award was for dispute resolution, but what has the European Union done to help the people of Cyprus? There were 1 619 people missing after the Turkish invasion. Not enough work has been done. Yet Turkey is still a candidate country and does not even recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is an EU Member State. It does not even recognise the Cyprus EU Presidency. What is the European Union doing about this? It is an absolute joke. I call for justice for internal refugees in Cyprus and justice and human rights for the families of the missing people. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, when I listen to Baroness Ashton extolling the great successes of the European External Action Service, I am reminded of the movie ‘Forrest Gump’, where a well-meaning but seriously challenged and naive young man finds himself at the centre of events. He was surrounded by the great and the good, but was never really sure of what was going on. We have seen the faltering and sometimes painful transition to democracy of the long-suffering peoples in the Arab Spring; the ongoing civil war in Syria; fears over nuclear proliferation; the death of Gaddafi; and the return of Putin. These are challenging times in which we are seeing relationships and dynamics redefined. However, at a recent meeting with an exasperated diplomat from the Middle East, he told me that he regarded the High Representative as being more of a hindrance than a help. We all understand that Baroness Ashton drew the short straw. Her role is that of a caretaker of an unformed entity. History is unlikely to remember her in any great detail, but she once found herself elevated to the British House of Lords without ever receiving a single vote in any democratic election. As Forrest Gump pointed out so eloquently, life is like a box of chocolates and we will never know what comes next. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, I should like to begin by saying kalimera
, President Christofias. It was a delight to meet you when I came to Nicosia in 2009. Can I pay tribute to your efforts to solve the Cyprus problem; a problem which is way overdue. The ongoing insult given to you by the Turkish Government of not recognising you as the President of Cyprus is something which should be highlighted in this Chamber. I would call on you and the EU to remove the candidate status of Turkey, because they have shown themselves not able to communicate with the European Community. You talk about this as being a bastion of democracy. However, you were educated in Russia and you would have seen how the Duma was no more a bastion of democracy than this place is in relation to the Politburo, which is probably likened to the Commission led by Mr Barroso, who uses this place as a veil of democracy for its actions. You are right to highlight that the problem of your Presidency is the plight of workers. In Athens you will find graffiti that says: let us refuse to live as slaves. Your background and your ideology as a Communist will make this very difficult for you. How are you going to protect the workers or stand up for the workers with the austerity that Angela Merkel and the rest of the European Union is pushing forward? Surely you would agree with me that EU 2020 lacks 20/20 vision? I have no doubt it will be as successful as the Lisbon Strategy, which was meant to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. You said in an interview on television last night not to expect a mountain from Cyprus. Well, the EU is the Everest of all … (The President cut off the speaker) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

blue-card question to Ioannis Kasoulides. 
– 
Mr President, I wish to ask the gentleman why he thought the attack on the United Kingdom was warranted. Let me remind him that my country has backed up EUR 10 billion in IMF guarantees to his country. Our forces are stationed on Cyprus, at costs of tens of millions of pounds every year, to safeguard Cyprus. If it was not for British forces I think that Turkey would have gone a long way further in 1974. But has this place moved on? I thought this place was about the future. What about the Austro-Hungarian Empire? What about Italian colonialism? What about French colonialism? What about Portuguese colonialism? What about German expansion? Are you moving on or do you want to be part of the past? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, many of my constituents have contacted me regarding being disadvantaged by an uneven playing field in the direct payments and CAP in general. Direct payments, or direct subsidies to farmers, account for three quarters of the CAP budget, which, of course, is 48% of the EU budget, so it is quite a considerable amount of money. However, the Conservative-led British Government is reluctant to make use of some of those discretionary funds that are available to support our farmers. In fact, they are increasing the uneven playing field by wishing to voluntarily reduce direct payments faster than any other Member State, which is why I will be voting against Amendments 1 to 12 and 13. The struggles of UK farmers are compounded by the Commission’s ongoing use of the historical distribution key to allocate Pillar 2 funds between Member States. This discrimination against the UK primarily needs to stop. We need a fairer allocation of Pillar 2 farmers and to protect our farmers in the UK. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, this act purports, via a package of measures, to boost assistance for small and medium businesses yet I fear, once again, it is nothing more than comforting words to give the appearance of action. The reality is that the European Union is part of the problem, not the solution. Europhiles like Malcolm Harbour tell us that Britain’s future depends on membership of the European Union, that more than half of our trade is with the EU. These are disingenuous arguments. Eighty percent of UK trade is internal, with 50% of the rest being with the EU. That is only 10% of UK trade, for which we have had a deficit since the early 1970s. Yet the EU and its bureaucratic rules and regulations are draining the life out of small and medium enterprises. No wonder the Federation of Small Businesses said to prospective MEPs in the 2009 European election guide, please, no more EU regulations. Malcolm Harbour attended a dinner, as I did. Commissioner Barnier, there are 4.5 million small businesses in the UK that account for 99% of all enterprise. That is almost 60% of private sector employment and almost 50% of private sector turnover. SMEs employ an estimated 13.8 million people and have an estimated combined annual turnover of GBP 1 500 billion. The EU has constantly negatively impacted on their ability to service the majority of their contracts, whilst making it easier for other EU countries to trade in the UK. No wonder eight out of ten people want a referendum on Britain’s membership of this corrupt and doomed mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, while I am opposed to this institution, I welcome any forum to discuss an issue that is so repugnant. Worldwide, it is estimated that well over 120 million women will be subjected to female genital mutilation. The aim of the process is to ensure that the woman is faithful to her future husband. Some communities consider girls ineligible for marriage if they have not been circumcised. How can you use religion and cultural tradition to excuse child abuse? It has been reported that girls as young as three undergo this process. Member States must tackle, and take a lead in combating, this despicable crime. Where the crime takes place in a Member State, strong custodial sentences must be passed. When aid is provided to countries where this is prevalent, conditions must be put in place to send a clear message that this practice must stop. Thankfully, due to health campaigns, female circumcision has been falling in some countries in the last decade. These involve a week-long programme of community education about the negative effects of female genital mutilation, culminating in a coming of age ceremony for young women. The young women are secluded for a week and undergo classes on reproduction, anatomy, hygiene, respect for adults, developing self-esteem and dealing with peer pressure. All of us here must do whatever we can to stop this barbarism. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, this issue stems from the failure of the French authorities to regulate its manufacturing industry. Typically, ‘France has a take it or leave it’ approach to regulations that it expects other countries to adopt. In June 2000, US medical regulators posted a warning letter on the Internet about problems at a breast implant maker in southern France. The French authorities did not pay this much attention. The French health authorities acknowledged as much in a 175-page report published on 1 February this year. Radical change is needed in Europe to ensure proper surveillance of medical devices. France has shown itself incapable of regulating itself and should have external checks. Many thousands of women have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, because of French negligence. France should be made to compensate all women affected by this negligence. In future, there needs to be more communication with the surgeons, the clinics and the patients. These companies must be checked and the findings should be open to inspection by health professionals. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Madam President, I would be interested to know what my colleague feels about Mr Howitt’s response. Not only was Mr Howitt rude by not turning up at his allotted speaking time, but he actually did not answer the question at all. If this Chamber had any credibility, these blue-card questions would be respected. Mr Howitt was asked a question after he said that he did not agree with political appointments; he was asked what he thought of Ms Ashton’s appointment, which was political. What does my colleague think about Mr Howitt’s reply? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, first of all, I did actually ask a question. If I used the words ‘does my colleague agree with me’, that usually begins a question. Now for my speech. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson institutionalised the concept of human rights in the US Declaration of Independence, and today’s US Ambassadors around the world have the responsibility for projecting that concept wherever they may be. In my country, Great Britain, human rights matters come under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, but these models are apparently not good enough for the European Union. The rapporteur calls for a Special Representative for this policy area, complete with his or her budget lines and dedicated staff. It is not, of course, within the realm of possibility that the existing EU overseas delegations could shoulder this responsibility. Might that eat into their four-day weeks and prolonged holiday entitlements? There are incidentally 119 such delegations. Surely, at a time of EU-enforced austerity, in situ apparatus should be used, rather than creating new, expensive departments. One aspect of the report I do agree with is that if a Special Representative for Human Rights should be appointed, they should have the necessary professional qualifications, extensive experience and a proven track record in the field of human rights, as well as personal and professional integrity and an international reputation. The High Representative may feel a little embarrassed at this valid point as these criteria were clearly overlooked in her appointment. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, the ever-growing figure of youth unemployment results from the selfishness of today’s politicians abandoning tomorrow’s prospects. In the UK, there has been a 43% increase in the number of young people aged 18 to 24 who have not had a job for more than two years. It would seem that some have given up on looking for work and are becoming increasingly detached from society. The youth unemployment crisis can be beaten only if job creation for young people becomes a key priority in policy making and private sector investment picks up significantly. My concern is that the EU is far too rigid in its general approach to law making to be of any real assistance to our young people. Yes, you might point to this scheme or that scheme, but the bureaucracy to apply for support is so disproportionate to the assistance required that it becomes self-defeating. The UK needs to offer tax breaks and other incentives to businesses hiring young people and offering more entrepreneurship programmes to help kick-start careers. EU, you are part of the problem, not the solution. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, we have heard a lot of fine words today about small businesses being the backbone of society and our economy, etc., etc., but what about the reality? I am reminded that President De Gaulle scoffed at the English and called us a nation of shopkeepers. But, Mr President, it is our small businesses and our shopkeepers that employ the vast majority of the workforce in the United Kingdom. In my mobile surgery, that goes around every town and city in the West Midlands on a regular basis, I meet shopkeepers who say they are being strangled by European Union regulation; business rates are too high; there is not enough training; there is not enough access to finance. Yet all they hear of, all the time, is more EU funds – the UK being the second largest contributor to the EU but having few recipients of aid and training. Take the European Globalisation Fund: every other country in the EU has had access to this fund except the United Kingdom. This is pertinent in Ryton, near Coventry, where Peugeot closed down in 2005. It also closed plant in France, but the French got training and the people of Coventry did not. Then there are these ‘JEREMIE’ funds, providing funding for small businesses around Europe, including in the south of France – a country that is a member of the G8. Is there any in the UK? No, there is not. Absolutely disgraceful! As I said, we are the second largest contributor to the European Union; we need to cut out the middle man, fund our own small businesses and leave the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, our youth’s prospects are dying of bureaucracy and its weapon of choice, red tape. Youth unemployment is a scourge that will affect Europeans for generations. People who suffer unemployment in their early years subsequently tend to earn much less. They suffer deterioration of skills and future job instability. In Spain, a staggering 46.4% of young people are out of work. Is it any coincidence that the states with the worst problems are members of the eurozone? The OECD has stated that the eurozone crisis is the biggest single threat to global recovery. The eurozone 17 will see their economy shrink by 1.9% this year. In contrast, both the UK and the US economies will grow. More than one in five young people across the European Union as a whole are unemployed and figures released yesterday by the UN suggest that this is set to get worse. UK businesses, both small and large, are crying out for less bureaucracy. Tomorrow, EU leaders will meet in Brussels to discuss jobs and growth. We can expect a self-congratulatory press release and a nice photograph, but we know by now what will happen. Good money will be thrown after bad. Nothing will change and, instead of stemming the red tape that kills jobs, the strangulation will continue. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, as an openly gay person myself, I agree with virtually everything that has been said in this Chamber this afternoon, except probably Mr Posselt’s speech. My concern, however, is that we have heard all these grand words condemning homophobia here, but what about practising what you preach? I have been the victim of two homophobic incidents since I have been a member of this Chamber, and Parliament simply has not bothered to act. If you are going to tell other countries, especially third countries, what to do, at least first practise what you preach. Fortunately, as Baroness Ludford has said, I live in a country that has been reported to be one of the best places – or the best place – in the world to be gay. I count myself quite fortunate. Unfortunately, there are many other people in the world who cannot say the same thing. Yet there is a football tournament on our doorstep in Ukraine – which will be held jointly with Poland – and many Members of this House will be travelling to Ukraine as representatives of some organisation or other, or representatives of the European Union, while today, the UK Foreign Office has put a warning out to gay people to be careful travelling to Ukraine. Why should a single member of this House or the European Union go to Ukraine? Should the European Union as a whole not be boycotting the tournament if that country cannot protect citizens? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I have lost count. Is this the 17th year in which the auditors have failed to give a positive declaration on the EU’s budget or, in other words, have we now reached 17 years in which taxpayers’ money has not been properly accounted for? I note the statement in the resolution on the discharge of the Commission budget that progress has been made since the resignation of the Santer Commission, but I have to ask: ‘Really?’ In 2008, Commissioner Mandelson was accused of a conflict of interest after holidaying with a Russian oligarch whose company subsequently benefited from his department’s decisions. In June 2011, Commission President Barroso ran up a EUR 25 000 hotel bill for a four-night luxury stay in New York. Then there was the Commission memo issued by DG Trade in 2009 which encouraged officials to conceal information from public scrutiny. The EU and its institutions have failed to practise what they preach and what places them above the citizens they purport to represent. It is time the UK left this mess. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– 
Madam President, my colleague Mr Fox alluded to the fact that there are already 27 signatories to the Convention and that this would just be a pruning exercise – or rather a preening exercise – by the European Union. Would he not agree with me that this is a further stage of federalisation and that in the 2010 Conservative manifesto it was stated that it would repeal the Human Rights Act, which was brought in by the Labour Party? Now, if this was actually signed, it would mean that they would not have the power to do so. Is this not another massive transference of sovereignty that his party will allow to happen?

Madam President, as a MEP I deal with constituency issues on a daily basis: issues where EU law affects people’s daily lives, either directly or indirectly. I am here to tell you that there is one deeply flawed law that, above all others, damages British life and puts our lives in daily peril. It is the Human Rights Act. It is a rotten law that Britain loathes. Human rights are worth protecting, and I am vocal in the protection of human rights. The Human Rights Act, however, was created in Britain by the Labour Party, which, despite warnings, was reckless as to the consequences. However, this EU-backed – and soon to be enshrined – law is now routinely and regularly abused by those who can cause havoc in civil society. Terrorists, criminals and illegal immigrants, with and without cats. More often than not, judges who apply human rights law decide that those rights trump those of the majority: decent, honest, hard-working British people. The case of Abu Qatada is attracting media attention. The human rights law, by allowing Abu Qatada to dodge deportation to Jordan, has inflamed the British public. Simply, the Court of Human Rights leaves Britain unable to defend its interests. In a recent survey, 75% of British people said they think that the act should be scrapped altogether. It is the Treaty of Lisbon that allows the EU to sign up to the ECHR, which further imprisons the British public, who never got a chance to say no through a referendum. Let me tell you, the British public are shouting aloud: ‘No to the human rights law! Release us from these shackles’.

blue-card answer. 
– 
Madam President, not as big a sigh of relief as the British public would! Yes, Mr Cashman, I agree with you. The Convention on Human Rights was actually written by British lawyers in the early 1950s. It was the Labour Party that signed the Human Rights Act, which enshrined it in British law. That was in 1998. What it actually did was to empower every court, from the most minute up to the Supreme Court (no longer the House of Lords), to apply these human rights, and the judges have taken political jurisprudence. They have not gone along with the public or the elected government. That has to be wrong. In a democracy it should be the will of the people that reigns supreme. If you talk about human rights, Mr Cashman, I want to point out one Labour politician, our High Representative Catherine Ashton – a Labour Party card-carrying member – who refused to do anything about the corrective rape of lesbians in Palestine. That is a disgrace. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Mr President, I welcome the international dialogue at the conference this week in Marseille. It is imperative that all decision-makers, from local governments through to Member States and the UN, promote initiatives for water quality, availability and affordability. Water is a common good and a human essential, and it is also a human right which should not be used for excessive commercial profit. With this in mind, the fact the Forum’s President, Louis Fauchon, has a foot in both camps is deeply troubling. Member States must give farmers incentives to increase investment in on-farm water storage capacity, which takes up as much as 70% of natural water supply, although the UK National Farmers Union has warned that there is no quick fix. I am also dismayed that in this year of CAP reform – as has been mentioned here by one of my colleagues – there is no mention of this matter. Is this a question of the EU talking with one head and then not talking with the other? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Would you agree with me and criticise the High Representative for her failure to tackle the issue of corrective rapes of lesbians in Palestine, and also police brutality against LGBT people in Palestine? I visited Gaza and Palestine in November last year. This is evidently a problem that the EU ignores, but it still funds Palestine and it is afraid to tackle this problem on cultural grounds. Would you criticise them for that? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, amongst the items on the agenda at the forthcoming UN Human Rights Council will be Cyprus. I would like to concentrate on human rights issues in Northern Cyprus and their place in negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In Northern Cyprus itself, there have been reports of violations of the human rights and freedom from discrimination of minorities, torture, and violations of freedom of movement, religion and speech. In 1974, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the city of Famagusta was overrun by armour, and the civilian population – fearing massacre – was forced to evacuate, leaving behind everything they could not carry. Only Turks were allowed to remain, and the Varosha section of the city remains isolated and unpopulated to this day. This is in contradiction with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789. Technically, this border dispute does call into question the legitimacy of the Cypriot accession to the European Union. A 112-mile long ‘green line’ still divides the island. 1 588 Greek Cypriots are still on the missing persons list following the Turkish invasion, but still the EU – with the exception of one or two Member States –pushes for Turkey’s accession. By discussing Turkey’s accession whilst unresolved border issues and questions of human rights in Northern Cyprus remain, the EU is undermining the integrity of the United Nations. You are overlooking appalling human rights abuses, and you are making a mockery of the integrity of your own position on human rights. Regarding Turkey’s statement that they would freeze EU ties when Cyprus takes over the EU Presidency, I would ask the High Representative: why is the EU negotiating membership with a country that is acting in such a bullying manner? Although, on second thoughts, the High Representative might agree that such a country would fit perfectly into the European Union. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I would like to give my thanks and congratulations to Mr Vaughan for this report as well as my commendation to him for becoming the King Canute of the 21st century, although King Canute would have had a much easier task in stemming the sea than the task of stemming the tide of EU expenditure. In the middle of an economic and financial crisis and ongoing national budget and consolidation efforts, the EU just does not want to see sense. It does not want to actually reverse expenditure but wants a freeze on inflation, which is probably still an increase. What we actually need is to withdraw expenditure and save taxpayers’ money. It needs to be by independent assessment. You have the daily allowances of EUR 304 and there will be a significant number of MEPs – and some MEPs I see in this place right now – who sign in on a Friday in Strasbourg when there is no official business, stealing taxpayers’ money. That should stop. Office allowances are only required to be 50% receipted. That should be 90% receipted and they should be independently audited, as mine is independently audited. If that money is not properly spent, it should be returned. The House of History is a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money that should be stopped. End this extravagance and return taxpayers’ money. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, on a point of order, in the previous debates on human rights, I had a timed speech and I also had a blue card, but you refused me a second blue card. But we had the previous speaker who had a timed speech and a blue card, and you also gave him a catch-the-eye. I would also note that the PPE Group here has had several catch-the-eye speakers, even though I was the very first person to make a request. You need to have equality here. If you talk about equality and democracy, at least give some pretence of it in this Chamber. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I am pleased to support any initiative that empowers and enables physically disadvantaged people, in this case, the blind and partially sighted. The EU has been, in my opinion, insensitive to the needs of millions of blind and partially-sighted people. All Member States and relevant institutions should make the strongest possible representations to the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva in June for a full, binding treaty. This is the best way to ensure the fundamental right to read that is currently denied to far too many – apparently 300 million worldwide. Put an end to this famine. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question.

 Mr President, I have a question for my colleague, a Danish Member, about the European financial transaction tax, which the Danish Prime Minister says they want to introduce very swiftly. Does he agree with the Danish Minister of Economic Affairs, Margrethe Vestager, who said it would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, or maybe he may agree with Lene Espersen, the former Danish Foreign Minister, who described the tax as ‘bullshit’? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Mr President, the Prime Minister is taking on the Presidency of the EU at a time when unacceptable behaviour threatens democratic principles. Such behaviour has become endemic and institutionalised in the European Union. In recent months we have seen elected leaders being bullied out of office and replaced by unelected technocrats, by an over-dominant German leader and her French poodle. With a possible new treaty on the way, the EU apparatchiks are desperately looking for a new way to include all 27 countries without the need for a referendum. So much for democracy. No wonder people across Europe are rioting. The message is there for all to see, but the EU turns its head away. Prime Minister, you again hold the Presidency at a decisive moment: the possible demise of the euro. At a time of crisis and uncertainty the EU is looking to the Danish Presidency for a strong lead. How telling it is that a country from outside the eurozone is taking the helm. The EU is looking to the IMF to help bail out the troubled euro. How telling it is that the UK, a country from outside the eurozone, ridiculed and threatened here in December, has been asked to prop up the IMF at this time. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, it has come to my attention that there is an increasing trend with regard to written declarations in this Parliament for children to be used. Could the President investigate and inform me what the legal situation is, whether they are paid or unpaid, and, more importantly, the insurance situation as to their welfare? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

 Madam President, I have grave concerns about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and I voted against this report. I have looked at the history of this report and noticed that the French car firms in particular, both Renault and Peugeot, as well as Dutch companies and German companies are great recipients of this for people they have made redundant. I am minded of my own constituents in Coventry, the Peugeot Ryton plant, where over 2 000 people were made redundant in 2007 without receiving any assistance or training whatsover. Indeed the Labour government or the current Conservative-led government in the UK has made no claims or put anything into retraining these people or other people whatsoever. There was also this week an EGF in favour of the Südtirol region of Italy, where the Member here, Mr Dorfmann, says that unemployment is just 3%. Yet we gave EUR 3.9 million to that project. Why? Why are we not training people where we do have serious unemployment but just throwing money away to a region where unemployment is only 3%? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, you, I and the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, are, according to Ms Sargentini, from the ‘plus one’. Well, let us hope that is ‘minus one’, and according to most of this Chamber, you will probably be most happy. I welcome the strong approach taken in this report; it is right and proper that transparency is given its correct importance. I am unsurprised by Mr Cashman wanting this because for the pro-Europeans in the UK, it is becoming a much more difficult job trying to sell the European Union and the secrecy of the European Union: its unaudited accounts or unsuccessfully audited accounts have, for many years, been a difficult sell within the UK. Something will need to be done. I would point out that it was the Labour government who brought in the Freedom of Information Act in 1997 in the UK and it ultimately caused them a lot of problems. I am unsurprised that they are hoping to put the Conservative Party in a difficult position in the Council, although they were very disingenuous when they were in power. I do sound a note of caution though on what I hear from the Commission, which is that they have no intention of being transparent, nor does the EPP when they are talking about undermining institutions and about a legitimate report. Who will decide what a legitimate report is? They will never allow transparency because they do not want it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, I would like to ask my colleague, who mentions the deplorable conditions in some EU detention centres, whether she would join my colleague, the Earl of Dartmouth, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Today, we have applauded with a standing ovation the Sakharov Prize. How can we talk about human rights in one vein, and be very sanctimonious and supportive of it, when, in the European Union itself, we have detention standards that are below common decency for human beings? Will she join me, and everyone else, in calling for the suspension of the European arrest warrant? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Mr President, I think Mr Murphy has summed this up perfectly; he talks about words and actions and that is what lies before us here. That is the decision that we have to make, or the Commission has to make. This is a question of values and puts into sharp focus Baroness Ashton’s assertion yesterday that human rights will be a thread in all the EU does. As has been said many times here, Uzbekistan is the third largest exporter of cotton worldwide; almost half that cotton is picked by state-sponsored forced child labour. Children suffer appalling conditions during the cotton harvest. Many contract hepatitis from insanitary conditions, and there have even been reports of police throwing stones at children who were not picking cotton because they were sick. So far, the European Union has failed to take action on this issue, but it is clear from all parts of this Chamber that this is an issue of importance that needs immediate attention. I would like to see a plan from the Commission, not rhetoric. Suspension of GSP would be a good start. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI
).  
– Madam President, I sympathise with my Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues. They are right that there is no European consistency or social cohesion in this matter, but this is a flaw within the EU. Yes, there is discrimination, but fairness has different sides. My constituency of the West Midlands in the UK – and the UK has been mentioned, along with the Netherlands, as one of the countries that wants to prolong this exclusion – has the highest youth unemployment in the UK. We need to provide jobs for those people. When the first wave of Eastern bloc countries joined the European Union, the UK was one of the very few countries that did not impose restrictions, and the then Labour government said that 14 000 people from Poland and elsewhere would come into the UK. That 14 000 turned into over 850 000. That put an extreme demand on our social services: on our social housing, on our National Health Service and on our social security. The British taxpayer simply could not afford it. Earlier today, we heard the United Kingdom being called ‘26 plus one’. Well, it has the right to defend its own borders and to defend its own economy. We will remain that ‘plus one’ and, hopefully, will soon not even be that ‘plus one’ and will be leaving. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card answer. 
– Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Vigenin for his question. Yes, of course, they are taxpayers, but what we are talking about here is the fact that, while they were paying tax, there was a British person who was unemployed because that job was taken, so that was a strain on our social security system. The United Kingdom is, simply, a small island. It is not about race, it is about space: we simply do not have enough jobs. I would like to see a points system in the United Kingdom, whereby we have people from outside the European Union and people from within the European Union as well, so that we can fill the vacancies we actually have. There is no point bringing workers in from around the European Union when we simply do not have the jobs. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card answer. 
– Madam President, I do not have the statistics to hand but I have read several reports since 2005 and it is there for people to see in the United Kingdom. We can see this. We could see in 2006 and 2007 the demand on social housing, the demand on our health service and the demand on social security. Child benefit is paid for every child in the UK, and there were examples of workers from Eastern bloc countries claiming this money for children still resident in the Eastern bloc. That was the demand on British taxpayers. There is obviously an economic benefit from migrant workers to the UK. The UK has benefited from migration since the Second World War, from our own old Empire and Commonwealth countries. We need a certain level of immigration, but it needs to be controlled immigration under our terms, not your terms. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Ms Ţicău, you mentioned that we are either in this or out of this, but the Treaty of Rome actually says that for any kind of changes, especially to any Treaties, you need unanimity. But the European Union changes the rules as it goes along do you not? The British Prime Minister vetoed a new treaty last week, but you are going ahead with the rest of the 26 of you. Where does unanimity come in there? There are rules when they suit you and rules when they do not suit you. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Madam President, I was in Afghanistan less than three weeks’ ago, in Helmand Province, visiting the British forces that are part of the International Security Assistance Force or ISAF. It is an interesting situation there, and there are many fears for post-2014, but since the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, there has been a 60% increase in health care provision, with infant mortality reduced by 20%. Education has increased – obviously including females – with 13 000 more schools, 170 000 more teachers and 7.3 million more students. These are things that we need to build on. I am glad – amazed actually – that the European Parliament is having this debate here tonight and actually showing some concern about where the money goes. This makes a welcome change from previous years. We must continue to help Afghanistan build, because it was a factory of terrorism. The UK, other Member States and the international community need to show faith with Afghanistan to build a strong and prosperous country that rejects terrorism and all the disasters that go with it. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, Mr Cameron stated in Westminster yesterday that only two options confronted him at last week’s summit: a new treaty without the negotiated safeguards for Britain or no treaty at all. He rightly chose no treaty. But with this failure, he left his and the Conservative Party’s EU policy in tatters. He mistakenly and naively promised the British people that he could repatriate powers from the EU, and that he could safeguard British interests. But such negotiations are not possible with the European Union, a Union that blatantly and negligently disregards sensible economic rules. You even broke your own rules in the Maastricht criteria just so that your beloved political project of European federalisation could move one step further. In your negligent actions, you cause financial hardship for people across Europe, people you constantly ignore in referendums. You deny them even the opportunity to have their say. To protect our interests, my country was right not to go along with your economic negligence. Even Ms Harms said that the summit denied reality and denied democracy. The British Prime Minister, having had his electoral pledge on renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU undermined and discredited, has finally faced up to the inevitable by refusing to have any part in the latest doomed rescue plan. Mr Cameron’s EU policy of negotiation is now in tatters and only a referendum on Britain’s future membership of the EU is a viable solution. Democratic integrity demands nothing less. The British people demand nothing less. Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

Blue-card question. 
– Mr President, as Ms Willmott knows, I am no big fan of Mr Cameron, but I think it is very disingenuous for a Labour politician to come here after 13 years of a Labour government where you deceived and distorted the European issue to the British people. You promised referendum after referendum but you failed to deliver one and called it whatever you wanted in order not to have it. I think Mr Cameron has to deal with the mess of 13 years of Labour policy towards the EU. But here is my question. You mentioned about the Labour Party supporting the European Union but we have a party in government, the Liberal Democrats, that is actually currently supporting the Conservatives. Will you then call for the Liberal Democrats to withdraw from the coalition and force a general election so that we can have a proper debate on the European Union? Nicole Sinclaire  (NI

– Mr President, I rise under Rule 173. I wonder, do you share my concern at the level of xenophobia that was experienced in this Chamber this morning towards Britain? It is an absolute disgrace. A chair of a group, Mr Verhofstadt, and I quote, said, ‘when you are invited to dinner, you are either invited as a guest or as a main course’. Could he explain whether that was a threat and what did he mean exactly by that comment? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the title ‘Fourth Railway Package’ really says it all for me, and that is that the EU is just no good at overseeing the railways of Europe.  UKIP, my party, has been voting against this so-called harmonisation for 15 years now, because we know it is difficult in the UK. We have a Victorian network, the oldest in the world, but quite why Brussels needs to harmonise the trains of the UK, which is an island, with the rest of the continent, is anyone’s guess. HS1 and the Channel Tunnel were financial disasters, with shares crashing and people losing huge amounts of money. But now we have HS2, because the European Union tells us we have to do so.  In 2002 the EU took the British Government to court because we were failing to fulfil our obligations under the Trans-European rail system Directive and now we have High Speed Rail 2 (HS2). The EU-sponsored HS2 will be costly, pointless and unfair, because it will punish the many to benefit the few, and I guarantee that those few will be the rich few.  If HS2 were such a good idea, then the business community would come up with the money, but of course they will not because they know it is just another expensive EU vanity project. Therefore the bill for this drive for harmonisation will fall on the British taxpayer and that, I believe – and my party believes – is grossly unfair, unneeded, unwanted, and that is why we are committed to scrapping HS2. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, late last year, I brought up in this Chamber the case of a British ski instructor called Simon Butler. Mr Butler is trying to ply his trade in France at the moment, but he is being hounded by the French authorities, who claim that his qualifications do not meet their requirements, which is blatantly untrue and they know it.  I finished my speech by asking for a meeting with Commissioner Barnier to clear up this matter, which he kindly agreed to. On 20 January, Mr Butler and I met the Commissioner, and Mr Butler now has a memorandum of understanding from Commissioner Barnier, which should mean that he can ply his trade without trouble, without problems and without being harangued and harassed by the French authorities. So you can understand why we were a bit shocked last week when Mr Butler was locked up in a cell for 36 hours for absolutely no reason. It just goes to show that it is a farce. We in Britain stick to the rules and we comply with the single market, but the French do not. It is a disgrace. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, for the first time in my life I must congratulate the rapporteur. I know that this seems surreal coming from a member of UKIP, but I really do think that my British colleague is on to something here. Work permits, rights of residence: seems perfectly good stuff to me. In fact it sounds like the UKIP manifesto. However, where the report falls down is that these sensible proposals only apply to third-country nationals who want to come to the EU for seasonal work.  My proposal is that it should apply to all citizens within the EU but, sadly, EU freedom of movement, which is supported by all the British political parties except my own, prevents this from happening. At the moment in the UK we have 2.4 million people unemployed. That is less than some of the other countries within the EU, but it is still an appalling statistic. Indeed, worryingly, we have 20% youth unemployment and in some parts of my constituency, such as Salford, it is running at up to 40%. Many of these young people cannot find jobs because the employment market has been saturated by a huge influx of Eastern European workers who are prepared to work for less money.   The way to solve this problem is by applying Mr Moraes’ report to the whole of the EU, and then we can get back to controlling our own borders. But of course his own party, the Labour Party, would never support this. The European elections which are coming later this year are going to be dominated by the issue of immigration, and I am happy to say that my party, UKIP, is the only political party in Britain which has a firm, but fair, sensible policy in this area. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, the civil protection mechanism means in effect civil protection money, but the European Union does not have any money; it belongs to the nation states. What the EU is doing is taking money from Member States and then handing it back, repackaged as the European Union. This is taking with one hand and giving with the other. It is little more than kidology. This is a desperate effort to get the citizens of Europe to love the European Union at a time when its popularity has hit rock bottom.  I am not opposed to helping out people who need help in times of natural disasters – fires, floods and earthquakes can completely wreck societies. We have seen this recently in the Philippines, where the aid has come in. Look at what the British have done: the UK Government has given GBP 60 million, provided planes, helicopters and ships, and the British people have provided GBP 70 million in donations. So this is proof that we already give aid when natural disasters occur. What we do not have to do is to filter it through the European Union for the EU to use as propaganda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, well we have finally made it, haven’t we? Agonising negotiations, budget cuts, budgets rises, tears, tantrums and vetoes that never were. So what are we left with? Well, we are left in the UK with us paying GBP 53 million a day into an organisation that has not had its accounts signed off for 19 years! So no change there then.  The EU has even tried to hide the bad press. Mr Van Rompuy threatened the Court of Auditors to give the accounts a clean bill of health. But even then there were more errors, so that means even more taxpayers’ money lost for ever. Last month we had an emergency vote to raise EUR 2.7 billion or, we were told, the EU would shut down like the USA. Of course, our friends the Conservatives did not even have the bottle to vote against this, and abstained, in another stunning victory for Mr Cameron: whilst we have cuts at home, more money for the European Union.  Do not be fooled by this agreement: it is merely papering over the cracks. Because next year the dam will burst at the European elections and in my country UKIP will be riding on the crest of an anti-EU wave. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, we frequently hear that the EU gives us the right to live and work in other countries, but allow me to tell you about Simon Butler, a British ski instructor who was arrested, handcuffed, and dragged off the slopes in front of his class as if he were a common criminal. Had he committed a crime? No. His only crime was that the French did not think his qualifications were good enough. We are talking about a man who easily qualifies as a UK instructor, so why were his qualifications not recognised? This is unfair. We are not talking about a criminal: we are talking about a law-abiding citizen whom the French ski and police authorities clearly want to victimise. I have asked Commissioner Barnier to meet me and discuss this issue and I await his response. Paul Nuttall,

Mr President, unlike many people in this Chamber I have actually been to a Roma camp in Bulgaria. That is me in a place called Fakulteta, which has up to 50 000 people living in slums in a square mile. And I saw conditions there of poverty and deprivation that one rarely sees outside sub-Saharan Africa. If I were forced to live like this, and you were forced to live this, you would seize any chance to leave, and that is what many will do on 1 January next year and many will be headed to the UK.  Some are coming to do honest work, we know that, but some will not. Sadly there are gangmasters within the Roma community who force children to work as everything such as pickpockets and prostitutes. This is already happening in other European countries and in January it will happen in the UK as well. So, centuries after social reformers in Britain stopped child prostitution and put a stop to Dickensian pickpocket gangs, the EU will foist them upon us once again.  There will be a backlash, trust me, and our government will not and cannot do anything about it because of the European Union’s laws. The best way, I believe, to help these people is not to export them round Europe: it is for their own national governments to do what our people did a long time ago and take the fight to child abusers who force them to work as career criminals.

Of course I think this obligation is completely wrong. We have 22 % of our own young people in the UK out of work. That is a million people unemployed. All that will happen when we open up the borders on 1 January 2014 to 29 million more people is that they will saturate the job market. It is about economics, it is nothing to do with racism and, quite frankly, we are only a small island and we cannot cope as it is. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -   
Madam President, I think the last debate on the subject of the Roma people really sums up why we are in the situation whereby extremism is on the march. People like the unelected Commissioner here just live on another planet. They are out of touch with public opinion. Your two flagship policies – the single currency and open borders – are creating a perfect breeding ground for the far right. Take Greece for example. The result of them being trapped in a catastrophic currency union has led to the rise of Golden Dawn. The austerity measures imposed by the European Union have driven large numbers of people in the cradle of democracy into the arms of extremists. Yet you still do not listen. If you want to know why the far right are on the march right across Europe, Commissioner, you have to do nothing else but look in the mirror. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Madam President, usually when I get up and criticise EU directives I can see a logic to them. It is usually a twisted and bad logic, but there is still a logic. There are a number of areas in this report which I believe actually defy logic. Firstly, the banning of tens. To me it makes no sense. You are not going to stop people smoking by banning 10 cigarettes. What you are going to do is encourage them to buy 20. So in effect what we are doing is, we are criticising places like McDonalds for supersizing their product but we are encouraging the tobacco industry to do the same. And all it will do is make poor people poorer. As regards the menthol cigarettes issue, a million people in the UK smoke menthol cigarettes. They are not going to stop overnight if you ban them, they will go to conventional cigarettes and you will increase the size of the black market.  Finally, e-cigarettes: e-cigarettes are proving, according to latest research, to be the most effective way of stopping people from smoking. Therefore, why on earth would you make them medicinal? Why would you make it harder to stop people smoking? I would ask my colleagues please to vote against this. It is ill-thought out, it is counterproductive and it is contradictory. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, this Directive might sound dull, but it boasts that it is the jewel in the crown of EU environmental policy. Now if any phrase should send a shiver down everyone’s spine, it’s that. It is massive. It rules 200 types of projects – everything from building bridges to new motorways, to rearing pigs and rearing poultry – and, strangely, the same document also admits that it gives rise to a large number of disputes. Well, that is not surprising because who among us really enjoys red tape when it gets in the way of our own lives?  Now it is the turn of shale gas. Everything must be regulated and nothing must escape. Well, in the North-West of England, we are sitting on possibly the biggest deposits of shale in the whole of Europe and all we want is to be left alone to move on and frack, to produce shale, as what it will do is give us cheap energy and a boom in jobs. Paul Nuttall,

 Madam President, in southern Europe we hear horror stories of 60% youth unemployment in Greece and Spain. In my own country we have a million young people out of work. Why is this happening? It is happening because EU rules and regulations on employers are making it difficult and expensive for them to hire young people. That is one point, but let us talk about the real elephant in the room here. The other problem is the fact that we have been forced to open our borders to 500 million people across the European Union. They have every right to come and work in the UK, to undercut young people and drive down wages. In a few months’ time, on 1 January 2014, we will be opening our borders to 29 million more people from Romania and Bulgaria, two countries which are far poorer than the UK. Already statistics are showing that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has risen by 26% this year. So here we are, debating the EU strategy. Well, I can tell you it is a failure and will continue to be a failure until the European Union allows us to implement sensible border controls. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

Mr President, the EU is finally coming to its senses about biofuels and reversing its policies. Hopefully, it will not be too little, too late. My party, UKIP, has opposed since day one subsidies for crops that grow oil rapeseed for biofuel instead of wheat for bread. It is practically taking food off the plate and putting it into the petrol tank. The EU is seeking to cut subsidies for biofuel. We in UKIP would like to see them abolished altogether. What we want is to end this ugly spectacle of farmers reaping subsidies instead of food crops. The price of food in Manchester in my constituency goes up and the price of food in Morocco and Mozambique also goes up, all because of the EU’s wrong-minded policies. A report by the EU Joint Research Centre shows that the price of vegetable oil and other foods would be halved in Europe if we ended biofuels and had no subsidies. These subsidies are the hard-earned taxes of the UK taxpayer. We would all rather keep that cash in our pockets rather than throw it away on biofuel subsidies. Now here is the real point. Many say that this is all in aid of fighting so-called global warming due to man-made carbon emissions. This is increasingly discredited as a climate theory. Figures only released this week show that the world has not warmed for 20 years. Indeed, only in this year the Arctic ice cap has increased by 60%, which proves that it is as likely to grow as it is to shrink. So let us just admit it. EU biofuels and the subsidies are all about buying farmers’ votes and wielding power. They are not about putting power in fuel tanks at all.

Mr Ashworth, you have not listened to me or else you are partially hard of hearing. I did not say we are going to outlaw anything: I said we should do away with subsidies. Quite frankly, this is British taxpayers’ money. This is pushing up the price of food and it is wrong. We are in the middle of a recession and I put it to you that I would rather the price of food be reduced than line the pockets of rich farmers in the UK – and actually not just the UK but right across Europe. Biofuels are a failed experiment. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Madam President, Commissioner. This food legislation, known in the trade as Parnuts, is fortunately not as dangerous as it sounds. A year ago, UKIP voted to repeal the amendment of sports nutrition supplements from the scope of this regulation, and for once we were successful. A bit less power for the European Commission and all its unnecessary quangos is the way that we see it.  Naturally, this small victory for common sense was not based on the Commission or the Environment Committee scaling back their ambition, but on the successful lobbying of ESSNA, a small but dynamic alliance of sports nutrition companies made up of two dozen small but innovative companies – primarily from the UK – which export sports drinks and protein bars. It was the culmination of years of handiwork on their part. It is nice to reward such efforts and win a vote – even such a small vote. However, I would prefer this legislation to be made at national level. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, on the face of it, and listening to this debate, I must say that shale gas is probably the most exciting development in the sphere of energy since the discovery of North Sea oil. It will benefit my own region in particular because we in the North West of England are sitting on 4.6 trillion cubic feet of shale, which means that we have the largest shale reserves in Europe. This could provide energy for the UK for up to 50 years and create tens of thousands of jobs in the North West of England. We also know from evidence in the United States that shale gas can reduce energy prices by up to 30%, which would be a welcome break for hard-working people in the UK in a time of recession. Lastly, shale gas can also provide us with much-needed energy security, because we can become more self-sufficient and not so reliant on the Middle East and Russia for our energy supply. Shale gas would bring more jobs, cheaper energy prices and energy security. To me it seems obvious that shale must form a central part of any of our future energy policies.

 Let us not call them earthquakes because they are not. They are tiny tremors, so let us have none of this green nonsense trying to blow things up and create scare stories. In May this year a government-appointed panel said that fracking is safe in the UK and we can move ahead with stricter legislation. In July the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineers also said that it will not contaminate water supplies, so there is an answer straight to your question. Let us not get caught up in green scare stories, because you have driven this debate on man-made climate change for too long with these scare stories and your green agenda. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I must congratulate our colleague on coming round to the UKIP position. We have been saying for many years now that Greece would be better off leaving the euro and going back to the drachma. But this is not the position of his government and it is certainly not the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Does my colleague agree or disagree with the position of the British Government? Does he agree with the position of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that more fiscal union is needed and that Greece would be better off in the euro, or is his position completely different from that of his own government?

 Madam President, figures show that the pay gap between men and women is still large. After all these years of EU gender equality regulations, targets, and initiatives, the situation is still pretty poor. And now you want to introduce quotas for women in boardrooms. To be perfectly honest, when I read it, I did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Because, if a women is dedicated and good she can get to the top. Did Margaret Thatcher need quotas to become the British Prime Minister? No, she did not. She did it based on raw ability, an iron will and because she was the best person for the job. When you bring in quotas you lessen quality. You promote mediocrity and I contend that businesses should have the right to hire the best person for the job and it should not matter whether they are male, female, black or white or anything else. It is called a meritocracy and it is something which Britain and the English-speaking peoples of the world have been pioneering for centuries. How would you feel, if you were a women who had worked very hard and had gone into management, only for a token woman to be handed a similar job? If anything, this will create a culture of discrimination. As colleagues will constantly ask, did you get there because you are good or did you get there because you ticked a few boxes? You call this positive discrimination. I contend that discrimination is never positive. So here we have it. In a desperate bid to sound popular you are not only patronising women, you are promoting mediocrity and you are hampering business. I would urge all Members to vote against this report tomorrow.

 If a woman is good enough, she will be promoted. It is as simple as that. What we should have is a situation where we are not hampering business with regulation in times of austerity. What we should be doing is ripping up red tape and allowing businesses to hire the best person for the job, not introducing even more ‘big state’ legislation and tying the hands of businesses. No, let us do the opposite. Let us deregulate and let us ensure that the best person for the job gets it, regardless of gender, colour, creed, religion or anything else. The best person should always get the job. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 No I would not; but I would not say that women would probably do a better job. Hang on – the greatest monarchs that we have ever had in our country have been women. Undoubtedly! Probably our greatest Prime Minister of the last century was a woman. It is as simple as that. But she got there – and the Labour Party probably does not like that fact, but there we are – purely on merit because she was the best person for the job. I tell you that, if you go down this line, all you are doing is tying the hands of businesses in times of austerity. It is wrong! You should deregulate. You should do away with red tape and give businesses the freedom to hire the people they want. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commission intends to impose a new interpretation of the weight and dimensions of HGVs to allow for cross-border traffic of mega trucks. This measure would allow mega trucks into the UK through the back door because in the end the government will surrender to a ruling on competition grounds. In making this decision, no research to assess the safety, congestion and pollution impact has been taken. In 2009 the Commission stated that mega trucks are more dangerous than standard HGVs. The Commission is not even waiting to analyse the public consultation, which only closed in February. Of course the Commission interpretation will become a minimum standard and so lorries could get bigger, even beyond the 25 metres. This will surely have a massive impact on safety and cost to the British taxpayer. For example, how many bridges up and down the country in the UK will have to be reinforced to accommodate these heavier loads? This just shows you the power that these unelected EU Commissioners have. No one voted for them, and yet they can make unilateral decisions, off the cuff, which will affect local areas and businesses right across the UK. Paul Nuttall,

– 
Mr President, this is essentially a commercial problem, and if action is needed, then it is a situation crying out to be addressed by the private sector acting in its own commercial interests, under the law. But instead we get this report, which has all the hallmarks of everything which is worst about the EU and the Commission in particular, because it is going to be done using taxpayers’ money. I thought there was a crisis on. I thought we were living in a time of austerity necessitated by excessive government debt but, as ever, the taxpayer will be required to provide money that he or she can ill afford. The Commission likes to pretend that this will not require any extra resources, but I am more likely to believe that a camel can pass through the eye of a needle. We are creating and extending a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies always set out to justify themselves by showing both the massive scale of the problem and the need for more complex solutions. You can see it in this report and in the proposed legislation. It states facts which can only be conjecture. It is telling that you cannot be precise, or even necessarily in the right ballpark, when assessing grey economic activity. I do not see any proof that this new extension of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will either save EUR 10 billion or 185 000 jobs, yet that is the claim. To paraphrase Mandy Rice-Davies, ‘they would say that, wouldn’t they?’ Before I could back any of the proposals such as this, I would require some kind of guarantee that this would work and save the taxpayer money. I do not want to be unkind, but is it not nice for the office to be put in Alicante? You would think that an office like this would be put in an established commercial centre or a place associated with innovation, entrepreneurship and growth, but it is placed on the Costa Blanca. It reminds me of the famous song ‘Oh we do like to live beside the seaside, oh we do like to live beside the sea’ because – come on, let us get real – we are once again seeing taxpayers’ money being thrown at ‘jobs for the boys’ corporatism. Where is the evidence for European consumers and taxpayers that they will be better off? That would be a real impact assessment, not the usual Commission approach of assuming what it seeks to prove. What we have here is the usual manifestation of the Commission’s proposals, because it will be a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It will never, ever, be brought in at a saving to the taxpayer. It will become eventually, as all these things always do, another bureaucratic monster. It is no more than a proto-agency right now but, as ever, it will grow and it will grow. I predict that, sitting there by the Costa Brava beach, the office and its lucky bureaucrats will become bloated on sun, sangria and paella. Paul Nuttall,

 Mr President, paragraph 100 of this report clearly states that you would like to see the EU flag at major sporting events and on the jerseys of athletes. Are we now going to see the EU flag at the British Olympics, at the Champions League Final or even on the shirt of the England captain? This is nothing more than sheer EU propaganda and vanity. The EU has never been so unpopular, yet here you are, wanting to stamp your flag on sporting stars in the hope that you can force the people to love you. But they will not. What you propose also seems to break the rules of sporting competitions. For example, under Law 4, Decision 1 of the FIFA laws of the game, it states: ‘The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or FIFA.’ What right do you think the EU has to interfere in sport in such a way to encourage countries to break the rules? It is hypocritical, because the EU is in effect a political organisation. You even say in paragraph 20 of the report that political propaganda should be banned, which is hypocritical. Athletes proudly wear the flag of their own national countries. They should not wear the flag of the European Union.

Blue-card answer. 
– 
Mr President, I would like to agree with my colleague. The EU is not a country; the EU is a false state. What is being created is something very dangerous, because false states like the Soviet Union only ever break up in one of two ways. They break up in peaceful divorce, like Czechoslovakia – which is the way in which I hope this organisation will break up – or in bloody revolution, like Yugoslavia – which I fear very much indeed. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Mr President, the EU world view is that it knows best about everything, from global warming scare stories to food labels. But the truth is that it is the consumer who is paying and not the EU and the consumer will choose what he or she wants to eat. Of course, some kind of labelling is just common sense, whether it is nutritional information or allergies but I would suggest that much of this report is nannying in the excess. I also fear that it will come at a cost and that that cost will then be pushed onto the consumer, which seems to me to be particularly dangerous at a time of an economic downturn. But here is the crux and I repeat it in almost every speech I give. We all know that the UK can pass laws itself, indeed our parliament was known as the mother of parliaments for many years. This is a decision that should be taken at nation state level. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but, in my experience, that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation, because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it. Let us be frank. This is about – and I quote – ‘air emissions and environmental taxes’, just as the last speaker said. So the Sovietisation of the EU continues. The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and – let us be honest – you want this data to tax and control, which explains your thirst for ever more statistics. The worst thing of all is that this is a regulation, not a directive. Regulations are far worse than directives because they pass into UK law and bypass the UK Parliament. This is very dangerous and, my friends, this is the way democracy dies. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, let me make the first point. The fact of the matter is that this place likes to control things from the centre. Let us also make another point, that none of the Commissioners are actually elected by the people. Democracy matters for the whole of Europe so, yes, I do believe that we are seeing a Sovietisation of Europe. The fact of the matter is that these decisions should be taken at Member State level. The fact that regulations can bypass my own parliament, can bypass the people who were elected by the British people, is an absolute disgrace and, yes, it is the Sovietisation of Europe. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, my father is a small businessman. He owns an electrical company and was only given the opportunity to set up this company due to the tax breaks and opportunities given to him by the Conservative Prime Minister and true Eurosceptic, Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s. Like all small businessmen, he is overburdened with red tape and regulation – much of it emanating from this place, the European Parliament. My father’s small business remains small. However, these kinds of businesses are the bedrock of the British economy and they amount to a staggering 73% of all businesses in the UK. My father drives a van, and like many small businesses, he is struggling due to the recession. I have a grave concern that this legislation will put small businesses like my father’s out of business for ever, because we are told that this legislation will, in fact, put up to EUR 5 000 on the price of vans. Small businessmen can ill afford this cost at a time of economic strife. The gentleman from the Socialists said that this is a good day for climate change policy in the EU. However, if this goes through, I guarantee it will be a bad day for small businessmen across the continent. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, again, this place shows absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in the real world. People are struggling out there, and what this legislation does – and it has been made quite clear to us – is put up the cost of small vans which are driven by many small businessmen across the continent. It will put it up by at least EUR 5 000. That is totally and utterly wrong, and it is something that we can ill afford in a time of recession. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, does the right honourable gentleman really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will, in effect, push up the cost of vehicles? He knows it will, and I know it will. In effect, what it will be doing is putting small firms in Liverpool and Manchester – in his own constituency – out of business. Does he think that is fair? Does he think it is morally correct? Is he prepared to stand on that platform in the elections in three years’ time? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

 Madam President, mobile phones, phone chargers, play stations, cameras, saunas, thermometers, refrigerators, freezers, toasters, kettles, microwaves, irons, air fresheners, clocks, watches, electric toothbrushes, DVD players, vacuum cleaners, children’s toys, video games, medical devices, televisions, remote controls, calculators, heaters, tumble dryers and washing machines. Well, that is just to name a few, because all of these appliances and many more will undoubtedly rise in price as a result of this waste directive. And to think that the European Union is prepared to pile this legislation on just at a time when we are in the depths of a recession and when people are struggling to make ends meet! I therefore encourage everyone in this Chamber to show sympathy with the hardworking taxpayers and with small-to-medium-sized businesses and put this prospective law in the waste bin. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I too enjoy my jousts with Mr Davies. It seems that we have these little jousts on every speech that I give. He knows as well as I do where the cost will lie – it will end up with the taxpayer having to fund this. At the moment, we are in the depths of a recession the like of which we have not seen since the 1930s. I am standing up for hardworking taxpayers. Secondly, the real point here is that this should be done at national level by people – by politicians – who are accountable to the electorate, not by a Commission that meets in secret and is accountable to nobody. That is the key. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, first of all I will repeat what I just said. We all know where the cost ends up – where it always does. It does not necessarily have to say it in the directive, because it never does. You never tell people that you are going to put up tax. You never tell people that you are going to hit them in the pocket. In my country, for example, it costs us GBP 50 million a day to be members of this club. The key to all of this is – and I go back to exactly what I said to Mr Davies – decisions should be made at nation-state level by politicians who are accountable to the electorate. The electorate of my country, Great Britain, cannot remove Commissioners. That is fundamentally undemocratic and wrong. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I support the protection of victims. However, when I first came across the European Protection Order, I thought it sounded scary, like the European Arrest Warrant, which, in my opinion, is one of the most intrusive and dictatorial pieces of legislation ever to be imposed on the British people. The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women. We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism – and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that. Let us be clear and honest here: the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan-European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law. If proof were needed, we only have to look at the European Arrest Warrant. I also see these orders as being extremely difficult to enforce in the UK, for we will end up in a situation whereby an order is handed down by a foreign judge in a foreign land who knows nothing about the conditions of a British town or our way of life. We have a saying in England: ‘once bitten, twice shy’. We have been bitten once by the European Arrest Warrant. I suggest that we shy away from the European Protection Order. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I hope everyone enjoyed Cancún. It is a lovely place but I am a bit disappointed to see that none of them has a suntan. Well, I suppose that is to be expected really because, while many of you were out there lecturing us on how we need to change our lifestyles to combat global warming, it was actually the coldest week that Mexican city had seen for over a hundred years. Back in the UK, we have also had the spectacle of scientists trying to suggest that one of the coldest Novembers we have seen in the last hundred years was actually caused by global warming. Do these people think we were born yesterday? This also explains why even more British people now believe that global warming is a scam and a way to raise taxes and exert control. But what have you actually achieved in Cancún beyond handing over masses of taxpayers’ money in the guise of the Green Climate Fund, which I suggest will end up being a lucky bag for African dictators to buy themselves more Mercedes Benzes and private jets? Personally, I think the name of the Green Climate Fund should be changed, and I think the ‘Politics of Envy Fund’ would be better and closer to the truth. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You are giving the game away there, because what you are talking about is world governments, politicians. We are talking about scientists here. Science is a slow process, evidence has to be studied and deciphered, but politics is a quicker game and politics is running ahead of the science; that is where the problem lies. The fact of the matter is that the globe is actually not warming; it has not warmed since 1998. So the game is up, people are finding out that you have a problem. What you are doing is conning people; it is a scam and the people are finding you out. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. 
– Madam President, one of the totems of a sovereign state is that it controls who can and who cannot come into its own country. Unfortunately, several governments in the UK have given away this power to unelected, faceless bureaucrats in Brussels. What a disaster it has proven to be. We have a situation now where we have uncontrolled EU immigration into our country, which has resulted in wages being driven down and people – indigenous people – being put out of work. I do not believe that this EU immigration liaison officers’ network has any power to stop this happening at all. We also have a two-tier immigration system in our country whereby if you are from Australia or New Zealand or anywhere else, you have a cap. However, if you are from Latvia or Poland or any of the EU countries, you can come to our country willy-nilly. This is fundamentally wrong. It is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration, but what happens if a country like Romania, for example, basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants? What it does is it makes a mockery of the whole system. I support elected politicians in the UK having control over our own borders. What I do not support are unaccountable, unelected appointees. I believe that the strengthening of this network would not be necessary if each individual Member State had the power to control who does and who does not come onto its lands. I therefore implore everybody to reject this report. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, if doctors and dentists and people like that want to come to the UK to work – and we need their skills – then by all means they should come, but what we have at the moment is a situation where our market is saturated: we cannot control who comes from the EU and who does not. This is fundamentally wrong. It is bad and it is putting people out of work. I shall give you an example. The taxi driver who drove me to the airport this morning was a bricklayer who has been laid off as a result of Polish people coming onto the site, undercutting British workers, and now he is driving a taxi. That cannot be right. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Madam President, ‘biodiversity’ is a word I often hear bandied about by Eurocrats, MEPs and lobbyists out here in Brussels. But I wonder if anybody in here can actually define what it really means, because I bet my bottom dollar that none of you can. Oddly enough, I think it does matter that you understand what you are talking about if you are making laws for the whole of the EU. But what does the conveniently vague and ambiguous term ‘biodiversity’ actually mean? Because the truth of the matter is that there is no correct number of species, whether it is on a Cumbrian farm or a Liverpool suburb or even in a Cheshire forest, and I defy the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to come up with a proper definition or stop using such ragbag words. And, may I ask, where is the boundary of the biodiverse area? Is it ever applied to offshore marine environments? And if so, why are you so keen to build monstrous wind farms that are detrimental to wildlife and do not even work! Let us be frank, you have not got a clue. There is no clear thinking, no coherent policy and no logic to what you are proposing. If you are going to preach, which is what you are doing, look in the mirror first, sort your own house out and let us start with the disaster which is the common fisheries policy. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, let us put a few facts in order. If you want examples of species which are disappearing, there are a lot of dodgy statistics out there – take polar bears as an example. People constantly say that the polar bear population has fallen. Yet the polar bear population is actually bigger now than it was in the 1940s. I agree that species are disappearing, but I do not believe that the European Union – which is fundamentally undemocratic, the British people have never had a say on it – is the forum to decide this matter. It should be done in nation states. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

in writing. 
– The amendment allows the many people in the EU, and the MEPs who represent them, to signal their unhappiness and opposition to Turkish membership and the concomitant political union. However, we do not want this to be at the expense of supporting free trade with Turkey – and without tariff barriers – so much of the report is unchanged. Many choices are invidious: free trade agreements allow tariff barriers. Customs unions eliminate them internally but continue to allow and even erect them externally. And, of course, customs unions limit and prohibit members’ freedom of commercial negotiation. Despite these concerns about customs unions as a concept, in the context of Turkey’s circumstances, we are accepting that part of the report’s content relating to the customs union because it allows those against full Turkish EU membership to register their vote. It should be noted that in the event, only 38 MEPs out of 736 put their vote against Turkey entering Political Union. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I must say that it is quite enthusing to see that there are so many MEPs who treat this place with the contempt I do. Out of the 736, there are fewer than 30 of them here – which is under five percent – and it is half four on a Tuesday afternoon. As usual, EU rules and regulations are running out of control. But that is nothing compared to the rats and mice that will run out of control when the EU takes away common rat poison from ordinary householders. This is what Amendment 243 of this report will do. This daft piece of legislation will ensure that only professionals will be allowed to put down rat poison, which is freely available in shops. So, if rats are in your front garden, spreading their diseases and chewing everything up, the ordinary UK householder will be forced to wait for the Council rat catcher or have to pay for Rentokil. We are already told that you are never further than 20 yards away from a rat in a city centre in the UK. This piece of crazy legislation will only make things worse. To put this into perspective, this is a piece of bureaucracy for a rat poison that has been safely used by ordinary folk for the past 30 years – not only in the UK, but across Europe and in the USA. I will finish by asking a question. Why are you doing this? Do you want more vermin? Do you want more disease? Or is it just about control and your obsession with trying to govern every single aspect of our lives? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to bring to this House’s attention a riddle which seems to be confusing MEPs from my own region in the North-West of England. In November 2009, Cumbria, which is in the northern part of my constituency, was hit by serious flooding. Homes were destroyed, businesses were ruined and sadly, a life was lost. As a result of the disaster, the British Government had every right to apply for the EU Solidarity Fund for assistance, and I am led to believe that the money which could have come in aid could have been up to GBP 100 million. Bizarrely, however, the British Government failed to apply. The people of Cumbria are honest folk. They work hard and they pay their taxes and a good portion of that is sent out to Brussels. Therefore, I believe that they have the right to ask for some of their money back, and I consider it a failure of the Labour Government that it failed to act on this issue. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I am increasingly concerned about the way local councils in my constituency in the North West of England are using car parking charges to top up their revenue. Take the small town of Congleton, for example, which is a local semi-rural community. The introduction of car parking charges will severely damage local industry and a fall-off in trade will result in a loss of revenue, forcing already hard-pressed SMEs into bankruptcy and possible closure. People are blaming the British Government, some blame the Unitary Council and others point the finger at the town council but, as always, the dark hand of the European Union lies in the background, for they are all working towards the framework set out in the EU’s European transport policy for 2010. You see, this is the genius of the EU: it is always one person removed. Whether it is post office closures or fortnightly bin collections, the finger always gets pointed elsewhere and the corruptive influence of Brussels does not appear on the radar. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, please allow me to speak frankly as one Lancastrian to another, because this is not going very well, is it? It really is not. Earlier on, Baroness Ashton, you said that Europe needs a credible foreign policy. How can we have a credible foreign policy when it has an incredible High Representative? You seem as if you are stumbling from one crisis to another, so much so that the British Foreign Secretary had to write you a letter this week asking you to buck up, to get on your game. But we in UKIP were on to this from the start. We opposed your appointment because we said you would be clearly out of your depth – and we are being proved right. It was said that your appointment, made by the Commission, would stop the traffic in Tokyo and Washington. But you have not even been able to appoint the Ambassador to Washington because old Barroso did you up like a kipper! It is also claimed in the British press that you do not turn your phone on after 8 p.m. at night. But, Baroness Ashton, you are the highest-paid female politician in the world. You are paid more than Frau Merkel, you are paid more than Hillary Clinton: it is a 24-hour job. To top it all, yesterday it was reported that you are being provided with a Learjet. You are expected to do 300 000 miles per year. That would get you to the moon, and most people now would like you to stay there. Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Madam President, contrary to the belief of the Commission, the debate regarding man-made climate change is far from over. In the past month alone, we have had the scandal of the University of East Anglia; then we have had the debacle over the Himalayan glaciers and now, we have got questions over the effect climate change will have on wildlife in the Amazon. Research has shown that at least 20 passages in the IPCC’s report cite non-peer-reviewed World Wildlife Fund or Greenpeace reports as authority. This is not science. We need solid, peer-reviewed scientific evidence, not the work of pressure groups using climate change to further their own agendas or politicians who use climate change to justify the existence of the European Union. I would like to ask whether it is now time to pause, to take stock and consider the ramifications of bounding ahead with policies that could damage economies, result in job losses or potentially result in energy chaos.

Take my home town of Bootle, for example, where many families live in terraced houses with no front gardens and little space at the rear. It is crazy that they are forced to put out waste every two weeks. This, naturally, has caused pile-ups of rubbish, because there is no storage space. If we have a hot summer, you can be sure that this will lead to an increase in vermin, which in turn is a public health hazard. But why am I telling this House? Well, because fortnightly bin collections are the direct result of the EU’s Landfill Directive, which was supported in this Chamber by the British Labour Party and the Conservatives. I for one hope that a large number of British voters bear this in mind when they go to the polls in the general election later this year. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, may I first say that I have sympathy with the workers in Antwerp, but I would like to point out another couple of issues regarding the EU and General Motors. Spyker Cars becomes Saab Spyker in a EUR 400 million deal but, make no mistake, this is not a normal commercial deal where one company pays and another company is paid. This is a Commission-style deal which is more suited to a command economy. Spyker pays, but using money from the European Investment Bank. In other words, the European taxpayer pays and the whole deal is underwritten by the Swedish Government. Of course, only the risk is underwritten. General Motors will still take a share of the profits and Saab Spyker will be obliged to buy fully assembled cars from another General Motors plant, one located in that well-known European nation of Mexico. Why are we saving jobs in Mexico with European taxpayers’ money? Can we not rebody Vectras at the Ellesmere Port plant in my constituency? For that is all Saab has been reduced to. And it is also common knowledge that General Motors and the European institutions have a special relationship. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has pumped over EUR 160 million into General Motors’ operations in Russia and Ukraine, and it owns a 30% equity stake in the General Motors manufacturing plant in St Petersburg. So I would like to ask the Commission why such extravagant financial support is available to countries such as Ukraine and Mexico but is never available to British companies. Rover could have been saved for a fraction of the price, and jobs probably could have been saved at Rolls Royce in Netherton on Merseyside, in my constituency, but at the moment, General Motors jobs in my constituency in the north-west of England are still at risk and yet the Commission is using my constituents’ tax revenues to secure General Motors jobs in Mexico and Russia. Paul Nuttall,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have recently heard that there is to be a closure of the Corus steel works on Teesside in northern England. This is due to an EU target reduction of 20% of carbon emissions. Thanks to the carbon credit, Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers, including suppliers. We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law. The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme, which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years. But surprise, surprise – guess what: the head of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, is also the head of the Tata Foundation, so, one must ask, cui bono
? Because Tata owns Corus. (Protests from the floor)
 The question I would like to ask is: is it now official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside so that they can outsource their business to countries such as India, or is there a more personal interest at stake here? Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– You did not answer my question, because the question was: is it official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside and outsource the business to countries such as India? You did not answer the question. Would you please answer it? Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Mr President, I have just heard a Socialist colleague over there talking about Greenland and the ice melting in Greenland. The question I would like to ask on this subject is: why is Greenland called Greenland? Is it perhaps because Greenland was once green when the world was hotter? It seems that the British people are onto this, because a recent opinion poll in The Times
 newspaper clearly shows that the British people no longer believe in so-called man-made global warming. The British people are very astute and they are clear that politicians have hijacked the environmentalist agenda. It is being cynically used to raise taxes, to exert control, and now it is being used by the European Union to justify its own existence. This week, we have also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate-research centres in the UK, which advises the government, being caught altering data and stifling debate. It is an absolute disgrace. I look forward to Copenhagen, when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room, which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past 10 years. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I would like to draw this assembly’s attention to the disastrous effect that the Biocides Directive is having across the UK. This punitive and non-sensical directive bans the use of strychnine, which has been used to control the mole population in the UK for the past 70 years. This was the case until the EU got itself involved. As a result, mole catchers are only allowed to use aluminium phosphate, which costs twice as much as strychnine and is putting many of them out of business. But it gets worse. While strychnine kills a mole in up to 15 minutes, aluminium phosphate takes up to three days, ensuring that the mole has a slow and painful death. This crazy directive is not only causing job losses across the UK, but it is also cruel and inhumane and it is another small reason why the UK is better off out. Paul Nuttall  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the underhand and undemocratic way in which the incandescent light bulb has been banned across the European Union. The initial directive handed implementing measures to the European Commission which, in effect, meant that the regulation was allowed to pass without the consent of this farce of an Assembly or of my real parliament at Westminster. The ban was a stitch-up by the political elite and was done on a nod and a wink. The people have been bypassed, but then the European Union is very good at bypassing the people. Just take a look at what has happened with the Lisbon Treaty. It was allowed to happen, unfortunately with the collusion of the British Conservative Party, who are the Jekyll and Hyde of British politics when it comes to the European issue. They say one thing in Britain and they come out here and they do completely the opposite in committee. To conclude, on the eve of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, feared that the lights would go out all over Europe. Well done to the European Union, because, with your obsession with the unscientific cult of man-made climate change, what you are doing is proving Sir Edward’s unfortunate prophecy to be correct.

 UKIP’s position is against. The Regulation restricts freedom of contract, grants powers to ESMA (including the power to prohibit investment products) and empowers the Commission to pass delegated acts and to adopt regulatory technical standards. Transparency in OTC dealings is all very well, but the volume of the information produced will be unmanageable within any reasonable time frame – rendering the process meaningless. EMIR regulates derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories in the European Union. The proposal creates new requirements to mitigate the risks associated with the derivatives markets, following the lessons from the financial crisis. It introduces new requirements for transparency, as well as organisational requirements and prudential standards for both CCPs and trade repositories. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This is a major piece of legislation, relating to financial services, and therefore has the potential to have a significant effect on the UK economy. The most fundamental change MiFID creates is to introduce competition into the EU trading landscape by providing a passport for trading venues and investment firms on the basis of authorisation in their home Member State.

 Mr President, I was speaking today primarily not as a UKIP MEP but as a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales. One fact is beyond dispute: the Court of Auditors has not passed the accounts of the European Union for the last 19 years. This is even though the Court has only to sign off a declaration of assurance, which is probably a lessor standard than the true and fair view of the Anglo-American world. This, then, is the context: the context of 19 years of unsigned accounts, in which this Parliament is now discussing own resources – and the conclusion is clear. The institutions of the European Union are unreformable, otherwise they would have been reformed back in 1994 – the first time that the accountants did not pass the test of the Auditors. This is a disgrace, and I hope that the next Parliament will do something about it because for sure this Parliament will not. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 You mentioned in your remarks that we should look at the impact of climate change on flooding. Have you ever considered the impact and consequent causes of EU directives on flooding? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Madam President, my constituents in the area known as the Somerset levels have suffered badly from flooding. This flooding is in large part the direct consequence of EU directives, especially the EU directive on wildlife. Money has gone on wildlife habitats, and routine maintenance and dredging – which is highly necessary – has been barred. People in the Somerset levels are prime candidates to benefit from EU solidarity funding. They should get back some of the disproportionate amount that we in the UK are paying to the EU. However, the UK’s coalition government has not even applied. This is an appalling decision, and I therefore ask two questions. First, what use is the coalition government? – and second, what is the purpose of Britain remaining in the EU? William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

It is designed to centralise control, authority and management over bank failures in the Eurozone (and other participating Member States – the ‘pre-ins’ such as Sweden). However, much of the drafting fails to make adequate distinction between the UK and the Eurozone, leaving room for judicial ‘interpretation’ to harmonise across the whole single/internal market – in fact the Committee amendments expressly encourage this. Moreover, Banking Union is against the long term interests of the Member States of the Eurozone as it perpetuates the euro as a job-destroying machine. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s Position is against. This Directive is designed to provide the EU with tools to deal with unsound or failing credit institutions and investment firms (and their group entities). It aims to make sure ‘resolution’ takes place speedily and with minimal risk to financial stability. The Directive intends to preserve systemically important functions when a bank fails so that, on failure, shareholders and creditors, rather than taxpayers, bear the losses.

 Our position is against. This directive introduces rules relating to payment accounts, with a particular focus on transparency for fees, easier switching mechanisms and broader access to basic bank accounts. Many elements of this reform have already been in place in the UK for some time, and the UK’s prime objective in negotiations on this file was to ensure that key elements of its own system were preserved. Unnecessary harmonisation, over-regulation and interference in freedom of contract. The right to a bank account may sound beneficial but would be more easily delivered by abandoning the over-regulation resulting from anti-money laundering regulations. If, as HMG says, much of this is already in place, we don't need a further tier of regulation muddying the waters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. More ‘retail-friendly’ legislation designed to eliminate risk, without realising this also stifles innovation and adds cost without reward. The consumer is already adequately covered by existing legislation and by common law, so it would be better to focus energy on improving enforcement rather than fiddling with the rules to create unnecessary harmonisation for its own sake. This regulation creates a new Key Information Document (KID) to be produced by investment product manufacturers and provided to retail customers when they are considering buying investment products. The negotiations centred on the appropriate content and length of the KID, as well as to which products it would apply. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP’s position is against. This Regulation establishes a EU procedure for a protective measure which enables a creditor to obtain a European Account Preservation Order (‘EAPO’) preventing the withdrawal or transfer of funds held by the debtor in a bank account within the Union. The EAPO will be available to the creditor as an alternative to protective measures existing under national law in the Member States. This is an unnecessary piece of legislation. As noted above, this is intended as an alternative to measures under national law. This is a matter which should be left to national parliaments, which can craft laws that are consonant with their commercial law. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Our position is against. These are further burdensome and expensive regulations for UK business. Also, the subject matter is material we do not consider necessary. They want to make large companies jump through hoops by providing huge amounts of further information to the public. As regards matters relating to reporting, a new recital sets out the main issues to be reported on. Environmental information, for instance, will have to include greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution and the use of renewable energy. With reference to social and staff-related matters, the information should concern, amongst other things, the implementation of fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, working conditions and social dialogue. Information relating to human rights and the fight against corruption, however, will have to include at least data concerning the prevention of human rights infringements and explanations as to the tools used by the undertaking to combat corruption and bribery.

 Mr President, I am going to focus on paragraph 46 of the report. This says, and I quote, ‘an EU seat in an enlarged UN Security Council remains a central, long-term goal of the European Union’. Later, it calls for – and I quote again – ‘the introduction of new members of the UN Security Council and reform of the UN Security Council’s decision-making towards the possible use of a super-qualified majority’. In the European Union, the United Kingdom has very little influence. We have just 8.24[nbsp ]% of the weighted votes in the Council of Ministers, less than 10[nbsp ]% of MEPs and the ability to appoint just one of 28 Commissioners. However, the UK is represented in its own right in international organisations. Perhaps the most significant is the UK’s permanent seat on the UN Security Council and the veto that goes with it. This report, and the thinking behind it, puts at risk the UK’s seat on the UN Security Council and also the UK’s veto. Let us be crystal clear. The UK’s continuing membership of the European Union does not enhance our influence in the world. It is in fact exactly the other way round. Our influence is thereby, and inevitably, diminished.

 With the greatest possible respect you actually got it wrong. There is a seat on the UN Security Council. That seat has a veto. What the report proposes is that the EU should have a seat. It also proposes that the method of voting, and I quote, ‘should make use of a super-qualified majority’, which would have the effect of losing the veto.

 Mr Ashworth, first of all I should like to thank you for accepting my question. Your party, the British Conservative Party, is a vociferous supporter of – it may even be said to be a cheerleader for – the entry of Turkey into the European Union. Turkey is getting pre-accession funding of about EUR[nbsp ]900 million a year, which is planned to continue for another six years. How does your party’s support for Turkey sit alongside your two principles of limited funding and value for money? I look forward to your answer. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD
). - 
 Madam President, I am just going to address one item in the budget, and that is the instrument for pre-accession funding. In seven years from 2014, the European Union has budgeted over EUR[nbsp ]14 billion to be paid to countries who are not EU Member States. These countries get the money because they are candidate countries. They are a former Yugoslav Republic, Iceland, Montenegro, and the one that gets the most money: Turkey. And Turkey especially will cost us even more in cohesion funds should it become a Member State. Bizarrely, the establishment parties in the UK are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the European Union. And let me be crystal clear: any political party that supports, let alone vociferously supports, Turkey’s candidacy can have no credibility when it comes to controlling, let alone cutting, the vast and wasteful EU budget.

 Thank you for taking the question. Mr Lambsdorff, you mentioned the word ‘freedoms’ in your speech.

And to help you with your response, it is estimated that the population of Turkey in 2025 will be 90 million. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 Madam President, geographically, Turkey is 97% in Asia. However, the Turkish Government’s attitude to dissent places it 100% in the Middle East. There is – like in Cuba – a bill to curb internet freedom. The Justice Minister has powers to appoint and discipline judges and prosecutors. Worst of all, currently there are 40 journalists in prison in Turkey. The Commissioner, in his arrogant self-absorption, said that he had spoken to the Turks about this. They are clearly not paying any attention to the Commissioner at all. In Turkey there is a subjugation of the media, the judiciary and civil society that is almost without precedent in a seeming democracy. To put it simply, Turkey does not subscribe to Western values. Turkey should be regarded as too big, too poor, too different and too authoritarian ever to become a member of the European Union. It is totally depressing that the establishment UK political parties are all cheerleaders for Turkey to join the EU. They – and this House – should think again.

Twice the length of the UK Sale of Goods Act, it is a minor masterpiece of legislative flatulence which will benefit only lawyers. It is voluntary for the UK at the moment, but on past form our British consumers will eventually be deprived of the tried and tested benefits of English law and our government will be powerless. Mark my words: UK electors have had enough of this. By the way, Commissioner Reding, please
 come back to the UK soon and often. Every out-of-touch, arrogant utterance from you gains the UK Independence Party an extra MEP. One thing which we can be sure of – and which I predict now – is that we shall have a very different Parliament in May, which would vote down this arrogant, out-of-touch, useless piece of legislation, which actually comes out of a Commission which acts against the interests of the people and not with them.

  Well I do not know what parallel universe you inhabit, Madam Mairead McGuiness, but what I can assure you is that the arrogance comes entirely from the Commission, from the PPE, from the S&amp;D, from the ALDE, from the Greens, from the ECR and never, not at all, from us.

 UKIP’s position is against. This is a proposal for a Directive, i.e. an instruction to the UK to pass legislation. UKIP opposes all such laws. In addition this contains requirements concerning confiscation of assets without conviction in certain cases. The UK already has similar legislation. UKIP tends to oppose the giving to the state of draconian powers of (often) arbitrary confiscation in the absence of a criminal conviction. We support, however, reasonable and proportionate measures for deprivation of assets where a criminal conviction has been registered after a fair trial.

This agency, however, is a top-down imposition.

 UKIP’s position is against. This own-initiative report has some positive points, and points out: a) that the widening interest rate spreads have significantly reduced the room for manoeuvre as regards fiscal policy in a number of Member States; b) the lack of ambitious reforms to enhance competitiveness; c) the importance of rectifying excessive deficit situations and current account imbalances; d) that the Member States and the Commission are not delivering on their commitment to complete the single market; e) that the Annual Growth Survey does not provide the means to achieve its objectives; f) that most Member States are still losing market shares globally and have a large negative net international investment position; g) only two of the Member States have attained their medium-term objective.

 Mr President, to declare an interest, I have the honour to represent Gibraltar and its people. I am speaking now to address potential problems at Gibraltar airport. The context is that the Government of Spain systematically – and as I see it, vindictively – inflicts petty controls at the land border between Gibraltar and Spain. This has resulted in massive and unacceptable delays. Incidentally, the people who suffer are mostly Spanish citizens. Because of the problems at the land border, air travel becomes of prime importance. Attempts have been made, and are being made, by Members of this Parliament, by means of legislative devices, to suffocate air travel in and out of Gibraltar’s airport. This must not be. This is a disgrace and I urge colleagues to support the amendments today. I would further go on to say... (The President cut off the speaker)

 Sir, let me first of all assure you that my memory is excellent, and I suspect rather better than yours. Yes, the Commission did make a visit. The Commission stupidly and predictably gave the Spanish Government about six weeks’ notice, so for the purpose of that one visit the Spanish authorities, for want of a better word, ‘cleaned up their act’. The reality is that these delays are still going on and you and your colleague should be heartily ashamed of yourselves. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth,

 Mr President, of course we are all, in principle, against subsidised imports – that is dumping – and there has to be trade defence when trade counterparties decline to accept the principles that underpin free and open trade. But by trade defence we do not mean what happened when the otherwise distinguished EU Commissioner for Trade was happy to launch what might have become a full-scale trade war with China over the comparatively minor matter of solar panels. I have described this previously as a frolic. It also took place against the representations of 17 of the then 27 Member States. This report, in its essentials, gives greater scope, power and discretion to the Commission. Illegal dumping by third countries of course needs to be dealt with, but not by appointed trade officials acting on a whim. The European Union, in its beginnings and in its operations, is a protectionist construct. On open trade, it is simply not credible. In the context of dumping, the way forward is a sense of proportionality. That is how an independent Britain should handle this problem, and there will be an independent Britain sooner than most people think – and that ‘most people’ includes the President of Italy today.

 Madam President, in foreign policy, in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, there was no consensus, no consensus at all, amongst the Member States. Yet again we see an EU activity that is wasteful, contemptuous of the taxpayer (as my colleague who has left his place was earlier) and duplicates what is already being performed and better executed – and this is the key point – at the national level. Nevertheless, to give just one example, the European Union is now operating an incredible 140 embassies or equivalent, and this costs a lot. To make matters worse, the value of the salary package of up to 500 of the personnel is greater than that received by the British Prime Minister. This is all a gravy train for those who work in it, with no real positive, realistic function, and I feel sure that electorate will come to the same conclusion in May of next year.

Mr Salafranca, thank you for taking the intervention. At the present time, there is no proper free movement between Spain and Gibraltar, which I have the honour to represent.

William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

Mr President, Libya was the most recent conflict directly concerning Member States, and just 11 of the Member States supported the UN resolution. From this and other examples, it is clear that, in fact and reality, there is no – and I repeat no – common foreign and security policy between Member States. What there is, is an EU Foreign Service – the External Action Service – apparently with 30 missions, and what that is, is a gigantic gravy train for EU insiders and their hangers-on. My amendment in June proposed that External Action Service personnel be restricted to ten weeks’ paid holiday a year. Just 84 MEPs voted in favour. This is shameful, and I hope it will be very different in the next Parliament. By the way, on a previous occasion, I have made it very clear how I regard the office and office-holder of the post of High Representative.

). -  
Mr President, as has been said, 26 Member States have individual bilateral investment agreements in force with China, and it would be a better use of everyone’s time if the Trade Commissioner dropped the attempt to negotiate an EU-China Investment Agreement and simply left it to the outstanding two, Latvia and Ireland, to negotiate their own agreement. But there is another vital point here. Switzerland has a trade agreement with China, New Zealand has a trade agreement with China, and in particular Iceland has a trade agreement with China. The fact is that a sovereign nation does not need to be part of a large trade bloc in order to sign trade agreements. Demonstrably, it is just not true.  Iceland, as most of us know, has now suspended its application for EU Membership. In my view, it is a very wise decision. In the context just of trade, were Iceland to join the EU, it would then be obliged to abandon the trade agreement it already has with China. And so, colleagues, the message for the UK is very clear.

Mr President, the EEAS is the EU’s Foreign Service. An EU Foreign Service is based on the assumption that there is a communality of interest among the 27 Member States. This is a fallacy. In Libya, only eight European countries took part, not 27, and one of them was not a member of the EU. The 27 Member States are – to coin a phrase – ‘a coalition of the unwilling’, and sometimes less than that. There is also the sheer wasteful cost of the EU’s Foreign Service. EEAS staff are very highly paid. Indeed, up to one hundred officials enjoy take-home pay that is more than that of Britain’s Foreign Secretary. The financial climate has the consequence that the UK is closing down embassies and consulates. Nonetheless, we are made to contribute – and to contribute very substantially – to the EU’s Foreign Service in order to advance a foreign policy that is not – I repeat not – ours. All of this – the EEAS – is a demonstration yet again that Britain’s membership of the EU in actuality diminishes our influence in the world. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

). -  
Mr President, Bosnia has an eye-watering unemployment rate of 43%. It is yet another very poor Eastern European country in line to join the EU. Once the door is open to Bosnia, there will be a massive outflow of people. The UK will then be a magnet. Back home, the British Conservative Party claims to be committed to reducing immigration. But, as we all know, that is an impossibility so long as we remain in the EU, and the impossibility is compounded as more countries get EU membership and their people in consequence have the right of free movement. It is simply breathtaking that the British Government and the Labour Party, none of whose representatives are here, can support – and support actively – Bosnia Herzegovina joining the EU.

Mr Rouček, I think with respect that you are missing the point. It is not very many at the moment, but that is precisely because we are able to have immigration controls. Should Bosnia-Herzegovina become a member of the European Union, we would then have no immigration controls, as you and your colleagues have said in this House many times – and, I regret to say it, with the support of the Commission.

 Madam President, my government, the British Government, recognises that the current legislation needs toughening up because of compromises, but is basically in favour. The rapporteur herself is unhappy with at least most of the amendments and is asking for a pass on the whole thing without the amendments. However, within that, the provision of services is already catered for because it is prohibited to prevent a worker in this situation, on grounds of residence or nationality, from working in another state by way of posting. The rapporteur’s latest brief emphasises workers’ rights when posted to another country, but surely that is a question of the national law of that country. If that is followed, why is there the need for extra legislation? Let the national law take care of it. But that brings me unfortunately to the dreadful business of the Laval case. That was 10 years ago now but it is still relevant. Here you will remember a Latvian firm won a contract to build an educational facility in Sweden and brought in a team of Latvian workers to do the job. By way of collective agreement, they undertook to pay those workers less than the Swedish minimum wage, which was an act of law in Sweden. The unions and the Swedish Government objected. They took it to the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Justice found in favour of the employers. When the employers and the unions in Sweden objected further and said that they might take strike action, and was that not legitimate, was that not within the rule of law, was that not a right? then the ECJ came back with the answer: yes, it is a fundamental right to strike, but not as fundamental as the right of free movement. If that is the way this project is going, it is descending into an Orwellian nightmare and will come to grief quicker, rather than later. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the Troika was invented to cope with the stagnation of growth and jobs. It has imposed austerity packages which have included reducing wages. However, trade unions have long argued that wage depression becomes dangerous. One country’s domestic demand becomes another’s export potential. Squeezing wages also squeezes demand, so imports and exports both go down. In such a closely-related trading block as the EU, that becomes a serious problem for all, as it sets in motion a downward spiral. A stable home market keeps production going and boosts exports to the rest of the world. The greatest hope, surely, is to allow those EU countries that need it to withdraw from the euro and to restart trading on a better basis. It will be hard going, but they will see the end coming into sight. Of course, to remain competitive, they will have to set their currency at a favourable rate for the export trade, and that is to devalue. In that case, wages will remain low. But what do people want: a low paid job or no job at all? For those countries most badly hit, their economies are in the hands of the unelected Troika. Can we really accept that, in an EU which keeps on emphasising its democratic credentials, we have actually seen the duly-elected Prime Ministers of two Member States usurped by the placemen of the Troika? Unless the EU returns to proper democracy, we shall not see the end of this austerity. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Commissioner for Employment says that free movement of workers is a key principle of the single market, which is why, in 2004, only Sweden, Ireland and the UK exerted restrictions on 10 new Member States. The then British Home Secretary Jack Straw now says that opening borders to eastern European immigration was a spectacular mistake, while Mr[nbsp ]Barroso recently admitted that the influx of eastern Europeans was putting pressure on communities and leading to abuses in some cases. Is realism now appearing? For Croatia, 13 Member States out of 27 will use restrictions, including France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, while Germany and Austria will restrict posted workers. Now, will Croatians join Bulgarians and Romanians in having first call on jobs in preference to third-country nationals, as in the Commissionʼs statement of April last year? But that is discrimination, and I raised this twice in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs last year and did not receive an answer. I now require a commensurate answer as to why this discrimination continues. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 In answer to the lady, I was quoting an official Commission document circulated in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in April last year, which clearly and unambiguously stated that in any competition for jobs anywhere in the EU, anybody from Bulgaria or Romania applying shall be given first choice over anybody from outside the European Union.

The lady concerned talked about my misinterpretation or the overuse of regulations, written and otherwise, by the Commission. This whole House works by the written regulations! Only recently we have had two examples in voting in this committee where a rapporteur was overturned in his request because he had not conformed to the exact written requisition that he was asking for. The whole point is that this place runs by written regulation, and I repeat, the regulation about workers from Bulgaria and Romania having pride of place over third country nationals was in a Commission document of April last year, and Mr Andor will confirm that.

 Madam President, homelessness and hopelessness lead to criminality in all too many cases, or at least to a social entrapment in which generation after generation is trapped in poverty. It threatens to become the scourge of the age. There are many causes, but one of the keys is surely employment, and one of the answers to that is surely education. I regret to say that my own government is guilty of neglect. In 1945 they introduced a scheme whereby those with academic ability could attend grammar schools, which had previously been the province of the wealthy. That offered a better way out, breaking the circle. It was the greatest social mobility scheme ever. It even benefited me, but later governments abolished it. We need an education system in Europe which caters for all abilities. We need academic schools, technical schools, commercial schools, sports academies, drama schools, universities and colleges of further education. We need industrialists to take on apprentices and send them to university at their expense, and we need those industrialists to invest in the poorer countries of Europe to help raise their standard. I do not believe in the mass migration of people across Europe promoted by this EU. We need settled communities, not footloose ones; we need people trained in a range of skills and for them, for the most part, to remain in their homelands to develop prosperity there, raising their standard of living and banishing homelessness through their own efforts. Finally, Madam President, allow me to point out that I come from country which was recently and disgracefully described by this Commissioner as a nasty country, and my final comment is: I do not wish to see poor countries in Europe.

Madam President, 9 000 people in Ireland – at Dell, Waterford Crystal and elsewhere – will be grateful for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, helping with guidance, training and education, when their firms close. Some blame cheap Chinese goods, produced through low wages, but two years ago in this House a Commission statement denied that this was true. The Commissioner said that it was China having its own central bank, setting its own interest rates and relating to world conditions so that exchange rates are helpful, resulting in goods at prices other people can afford. Instead, we have draconian measures in place to prevent individual companies establishing their own exchange rates and competing globally, promoting prosperity. At the same time, report after report comes out of this House, all imposing more regulation. The result? Higher costs, reduced sales, firms closing and moving abroad, leading to rising unemployment. And all you do is wheel out the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, trying to conceal the fact that company after company is closing under the weight of EU inflicted regulation, when you cannot even keep well-established companies going. And you call that world leadership? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, the UK Health Food Manufacturers Association is non-profit. It represents 120 companies and suppliers; it has a very strong safety record and it knows that safety levels will be set well below what is regarded as safe in the UK in cases where there is no health risk. They know that only 22 additives will be allowed, meaning that potassium sorbate – a vital ingredient for vitamin D drops as recommended by our own Department of Health for children under the age of 36 months – will be banned.   GBP 100 million of sales are at risk. In the UK, over 700 health food stores will be at risk, with 4 000 jobs – all in the SME sector. Across the EU, over EUR 8 billion will be at risk: 5 000 companies and 75 000 jobs. And this report is supposed to be about more competitiveness, sustainability and an inclusive Europe. What is inclusive about shutting out the SMEs so that, once again, it is the big companies that pick up the trade and leave the unemployed from the SMEs to flounder and do what they can?

Madam President, I listened very carefully (or as carefully as I could) to what the rapporteur was saying on the various amendments to the amendments, but since our voting lists are not in numerical order of amendments it was impossible to follow, and we still do not know what those amendment alterations are.

 Mr President, I am against this report because I am a libertarian. I want to let the people decide what is best for them, and several UK organisations agree with me, especially on Amendment 40. The Commission document is a real dog’s breakfast. It lists among the regulatory instruments everything from sticking plasters to X-ray machines, taking in elbow implants, lung implants, breast implants, even presumably the metal implant in my own left ankle, which is now all metal and pieces of plastic and I am perfectly okay. The impact of this will, of course, be in over-the-counter sales, and here we have small and medium-sized enterprises at risk. You are going to drive up unemployment at a time when we already have over-unemployment; many young people out of work, when they could be working in shops selling this sort of thing. It will only produce more red tape, and the SMEs will then suffer. And who picks up the bill? Who picks up the pieces?  Why, the big pharma. They will make hay while the sun shines, when all the time everybody in the EU thinks it is all about them as individuals. It is not. It is all about the big companies. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Madam President, from Britain, from the House of Lords, our upper Chamber, I have received a note today of an inquiry they have launched into Europe’s young jobless. They note that the EU is going to spend EUR 8 billion over the next six years and they want to know if that will add any value to all these proposals. They note also that there is a brain drain in Europe and what are we going to do about it, with young people, without a job, leaving in such great numbers for work elsewhere? We all know that Spain has got something like 50% unemployed: 280 000 young people left Spain alone last year to seek their fortunes either in the rest of Europe or in South America. It is no coincidence that Spain, together with several other southern European countries, is struggling. Ireland, Portugal, Greece and others: what have they in common? The euro: a strait-jacket which is robbing them of their economy. No wonder they are in trouble; no wonder they have high youth unemployment. Let them sort out their own salvation with their own former currencies restored. It may lead to low-wage economies but then you have to answer the question: do you want a low-paid job or no job at all? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I did not vote on any of the amendments since there was no voting option to reject the granting of authority for the Commission to extract payments for emissions. Whether one voted ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to any amendment would have been to endorse the authority to extract payments. either for current emissions or for earlier emissions, ‘backloading’, or for both. I therefore voted ‘no’ to the whole proposal. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

  Mr President, I have recently been in contact with the President of the Caravan Club of Great Britain. He is most concerned about this possible new legislation. I personally am horrified. I don’t know how many other people here I speak for, but I was a caravanner for many years and belonged to the Caravan Club – not to attend their gatherings and rallys and so on, but to obtain advice and information, including tips on how to tow. I hardly use my caravan in the UK. I brought it across the Channel and had my holidays here. I’ve towed it all the way from Calais to the south of France. I’ve taken it over the Alps into Italy. I’ve gone around the Alps in Switzerland and other places, all without an accident of any description. Nor did I see one with any other caravan, and nor did I see a caravan on a caravan site which had obviously been damaged in an accident. Why? Because I took my caravan for servicing myself every year. I did not want to part company with my caravan down a German autobahn. Neither does anybody else! Do people not understand that if a caravan is not in good order and has an accident on its own, like snaking or suddenly departing from its pre-designed course, then it takes the car with it and everybody in the car will suffer injury if not death? Caravanners, in spite of what they might look like, are not mad. They will look after their caravans for the sake of their own necks. This proposed regulation is completely superfluous and I will oppose it with all my strength. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP strongly supports UK laws which seek to prevent, control or, where necessary, punish those who engage in domestic violence. The UK has developed an effective system of law to protect spouses and children from such acts. Such laws are constantly being improved. UKIP will always support sensible and workable developments in those laws. This measure allows the writ of foreign judges – who are in no way accountable to Parliament or the British people – to run the UK. A protection order made in any other Member State will be enforceable without further ado, potentially leading to imprisonment. As such this is an unacceptable infringement of the sovereign right of Parliament and the Courts to have exclusive jurisdiction over such matters according to UK law. Furthermore an order made by a foreign judge with no concept of the very real difficulties and practicabilities of the enforcement of such orders within the context of UK law will lead to grave injustices which will make those produced by the European Arrest Warrant seem tame in comparison. The UK Courts are the best forum for such matters, For those reasons we strongly oppose this measure, whilst abhorring all domestic violence. Derek Roland Clark,

Mr President, I speak from a UK perspective. We have a long and proud history of accepting people from elsewhere, especially those fleeing political and religious persecution.  In a time when there were no schools or hospitals, and electricity and public transport were non-existent, newcomers made their own way; but now they need these facilities, and we, the most densely-crowded country in the EU, are struggling to cope. That is no good for anyone, and we certainly cannot provide the social security they need. In these difficult times, we cannot provide properly for those who have been paying their taxes in the UK throughout their working lives; we cannot go on taking in people. So the suggestions in this report are impossible. Even my own government, which is in favour of the EU, is concerned that the number of proposals in this report are overly bureaucratic. We cannot regularise illegal immigrants. That would open the door to a flood of unmanageable proportions. Will the UK suddenly be expected to accept great numbers of Bulgarians and Romanians after 1 January next year? Especially after the Commission document presented to the Committee on Employment last April, which demands that Bulgarians or Romanians seeking work must be given prior claim over a third-country national. That excludes people from the British Commonwealth, who the rapporteur now thinks should go to the US instead.  It is also discrimination which is outlawed by the Lisbon Treaty. I do not think it is right to take in people for menial work; that is exploitation. Skilled workers from Eastern Europe may be welcome, but they are exactly what their own country needs to build their economy and prosperity. That is not fair. I do not want to see poor countries in Europe.  In truth, is not this report part of a programme to force people to move around the EU with financial assistance from the Commission, mixing up the peoples of Europe so that its countries disappear, to be replaced by a single state called Europe?

Mr President, note that unemployment in the EU is 10.5% of the working age population. Among the young it is averaging 28% across the EU, with nearly 50% in Greece and Spain. In the UK the overall unemployment rate is 7.7%, with youth unemployment at less than 20%. At the same time Britain is seen as unenthusiastic towards the EU. Indeed this morning, commenting on David Cameron, speakers said that we cannot take the parts we want and opt out of the rest. That is an echo of one of the first comments I heard in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs after election in 2004: ‘We do not want Member States to opt out of the Working Time Directive. That will give them an advantage’. But we did opt out – legally – of certain provisions of the WTD, leaving UK employers more free to employ workers. Is that why the UK figures are better than the EU average? Social aspects and growth improve when people have jobs. It is not therefore a question of policy coordination, but of keeping policy out of employment. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

The EU is not doing very well. Its economic growth is failing, which is what you are talking about today. The whole idea is falling apart. We are failing, and if we are not, why is it that so many firms are opting out of Europe and taking their business abroad, resulting in us having to spend millions of euros on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to make up for their shortfall? Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Mr President, we should be concerned that growth in the EU is fading and that companies are moving abroad. Result? A great increase in the claims under the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to help redundant workers. That must be partly the reason for the massive budget deficit we heard about this morning. Did I hear right then? EUR 60 billion? That is taxpayers’ money.  This report speaks, among other things, of disseminating good practices, improving soft regulation processes, company disclosure of social and environmental information, emphasising the importance of national and subnational policies, and more of the same. It is about time the EU stopped generating the red tape of rules and regulations. In itself that consumes resources, so cut the red tape, reduce the business rate tax burden, and big multinationals might become more responsible, inclined to pay their tax and not avoid it. They could then concentrate on marketing their goods, generating income and retaining the workforce. And we all benefit. John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark and William (The Earl of) Dartmouth  (EFD

 UKIP voted against this report as it is yet more EU legislation over criminal law. The EU has no democratic right to legislate in this area and law-making should be left to elected politicians, accountable to the public, not unelected foreign Commissioners in Brussels. Of course, victims of crime should have the strongest rights and legal protection, but that is already afforded in UK law and “minimum standards” at EU level may well create a race to the bottom which makes our criminal justice system weaker. Withdrawal from the EU, European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice would be a major step forward for victims of crime seeking swift and proportional justice.

 UKIP abstained on the final vote of this report. Although there are elements to CFP reform which will give a small bit of relief to the fishing industry – and any changes to the current disastrous CFP rules is a step forward for the industry which the EU itself has destroyed – the only way we can save our stocks and fishing industry is to scrap the CFP altogether and repatriate it back to national governments accountable by the ballot box. The EU has no democratic mandate to create law in the UK and we cannot legitimise the process. UKIP did support amendments which decentralised power back to Member States and those which would cut red tape and costs to our fishing industry.

 This is an own initiative report, which is non-legislative and not binding on the EU Commission. UKIP voted against this although we do agree with ideas such as the use of selective fishing gear, the move towards discards and we share concerns over the proposed system of ‘transferable fishing concessions’ – we cannot support calls for more powers for EU fishing agencies, the creation of EU rules as to how scientists should collect data or EU propaganda campaigns aimed at schoolchildren. The CFP has been an economic and environmental disaster and we supported amendments which will help our fishing industry, but until the CFP is scrapped and fishing regulation is given back to elected governments, our fish stocks and industry will continue to suffer. Fishing regulation should be created by politicians accountable to the people by the ballot box, not the unelected Commission of the EU. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, with fish stocks in serious decline in Europe’s rich fishing grounds, the CFP is a failure. Yet these reports are laced with the same old Eurospeak – regulation, restriction, prohibit. Before the CFP, most European fishermen, unhampered by bureaucratic interference, had been fishing responsibly, looking after their own waters and therefore handing on viable fisheries down the generations. But the EU destroyed this culture of care and so now we have rules about total permissible catch and the wretched discard policy, which has decimated stocks. If you do not like lessons from the past, then try the present. Norway and Iceland still record good catches and find many species spawning well, but then they ban discards and other destructive EU measures which, as noted in these reports, have reduced EU fishing fleets. The UK fishing fleet is barely half its former size and so much of the fish sold in the UK now comes from Iceland. What an indictment of the CFP.

– Madam President, I do not believe that spending more taxpayers’ money will solve the growing problem of youth unemployment. Nor are grand plans and schemes, like the EU Youth opportunities initiative, the answer, for these have nothing to offer. To tackle a problem resulting from its own policies, the EU is proposing another expensive Commission programme. Rather, we should stop taking money from small businesses in particular, and remove the red tape burden from SMEs, which are the employers of half the workforce. That will free their businesses up and allow them to employ young people, reducing unemployment. We should reduce taxes on big business in return for them taking on young people in apprenticeships and training. With this kind of stimulus, they will prosper as their trainees, becoming more productive in years to come, plough their skills back in. For businesses offer actual practice and training, forming the habit of working and taking home money which has been earned, creating the dignity of providing for oneself, which can only help society. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– It was not me that said this first. It was Commissioner Barroso himself who, just under two years ago, said in this House that red tape was strangling small businesses. I have since asked the Commissioner twice what he is going to do about removing or reducing red tape. I get no answer. As for what I mean, I mean all the petty, small regulations which so hamper small businesses and drive some of them to the wall and some of them to distraction as the owner sits up late at night completing this form or that form or accounting for this penny or that penny. No, it is not the complete answer; nothing ever is. But it would be a jolly good start if small businesses in particular were freed of much of this red tape so they could get on with the job of doing what they are doing and then, because they have got more capital to spend, employ young people and help youth unemployment.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the EFF has EUR 4.5 billion to spend on fishing over the period 2007 to 2013 covering scrapping of fishing vessels, aquaculture, inland fishing, sustainability and administration of the fund. But fishing managed very well before the CFP was introduced, livings were made, fish was plentiful. Since its inception in 1973, the CFP has introduced rules and regulations to control fishing. Now the EFF – why? After all, fishermen have been plying their trade for centuries without all this, and a viable industry has been passed down the generations. Fishermen are not stupid. They have looked after their stocks, just as a farmer looks after his livestock and land. This proposal, of course, is a backdoor way of giving extra financial support to countries which have been bailed out, bailout funds under the EFSM will trigger this extra support from the EFF, and yet more taxpayers’ money goes down the drain. So this whole scheme, purporting to help fishing with more funds, is really an addition to bailouts, which are supposed to be loans by way of bond issues with time limits for repayment. Does that mean that the extra EFF money will not be included in bailout repayments? Does it mean that cash will be available without issuing bonds? If so, EFF funding will be a gift to offset a debt. What kind of finance is that? Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, with the Greek and Italian debt crises under the burden of the euro, of course unemployment is rising. Spain has over 40% youth unemployment – yet there is a call for more Europe. Employment policy should be to cut regulations by half at least as the target for 2020, instead of which more legislation is being proposed. If you want growth and jobs, stop promoting the failed euro. Look at what it has done to Greece. Set them and others free, free to reorganise their own currency and to set their own interest rates. Remember the euro forerunner, the ERM? My country was in that project; interest rates rose and so did unemployment. Finally, interest rates went up to 15% – totally unsustainable – but at least the government came to its senses and withdrew from the ERM. That was on Black Wednesday in 1992, but it should be remembered as ‘Freedom Wednesday’, for interest rates fell, employment gradually recovered and we entered a period of economic growth. Now that is the model you want. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP supports democracy and human rights. However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers.

– Madam President, how many men does it take to change a light bulb? In one English council, tenants must send for council staff, who may not use ladders, only scaffolding. That is three people: one holds the rigging, one changes the bulb and one supervises. That is the crazy English, but I do have better examples. At a meeting six years ago, I was astonished to hear of the number of young people injured at work. The independent body – unconnected with the EU – which had called the meeting suggested a range of safe practices which they claimed had reduced these figures – without legislation. As I have said before, good ideas always spread, and a Latvian took these documents to use locally. But the EU legislates; we do it every day. Why – if good results can be achieved by unbiased advice from non-political sources? So I ask that elements of this draft report, such as simplifying existing legislation, implementing national strategies and adjusting to the context of Member States, carry through to the final, advisory version. Voluntary systems are always best: no infringement proceedings. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Mr President, the CFP was only introduced in 1973, when the UK joined the common market. Up to then, UK fishermen had looked after their fisheries so well, without all these regulations, that other profligate Member States wanted a slice of our action. The result? Illegal fishing. Any system of complex rules and regulations produces cheats – that is human nature. Now you want to duplicate our coastguard and to consider more rules to combat possible illegal recreational fishing. Does the EU never stop meddling? To preserve fish stocks, Member States must be responsible for their own fishing waters up to the 200-mile limit or the median line. Bilateral arrangements would be up to them and they would have to protect their own fish stocks in their own interests, under their laws and their enforcement. Norway does just that. Stocks have recovered, especially the spawning stocks of several species – but then Norway is not in the EU and does not have to obey its crazy rules. It bans discards, requiring that all fish caught be landed. Meanwhile, EU stocks are seriously depleted. I know thought is being given to discards, but after 38 years of waste, will our stocks recover? As to combating illegal fishing globally, the EU’s discard policy is the greatest illegal fishing scandal of all! That – and licensing European fleets to raid the waters of the third world, reducing those people to poverty – is what I call illegal. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– I could not support amendments 34, 35D, 36, to the Březina report on the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for nuclear research and training activities, because while these amendments appear to represent a budget cut of EUR 2.46 billion from spending on nuclear programmes, in fact the money is already budgeted and the amendments would merely redirect the money away from nuclear research to the green agenda. Instead of limiting the waste of taxpayers’ money, this amendment would simply waste it elsewhere. I abstained also in the final vote on the legislative resolution as, in the context of the ongoing budget negotiations, the financing of ITER has not yet been confirmed Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, to quote from your own documents, ‘national and local events will take place in every EU Member State’ – awareness-raising campaigns, workshops, school indoctrination and so on. The documents also say that this is mainly the responsibility of the Member State. No EU money is forthcoming, so it is Member States’ money. How do those countries most in need manage that? Only last month, this House voted to raise the take from Member States by 5%. Of a hundred budget lines, some 20 were for a reduction. With like-minded MEPs, I supported those – which would have saved European taxpayers EUR 100 million – but was outvoted by most of you on all except two lines, so only EUR 1 million was saved. If people keep more of their earnings, they spend more, helping other businesses to keep going and helping employment. So Member States who really need help for this programme will not get it. Where will they find the money? You have already raided their bank balances for bailout funds. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

− UKIP is firmly against all forms of sexual offences against children and in favour of tough, comprehensive criminal law to criminalise all forms of sexual offences against young people. The UK already has a considerable body of criminal law dealing with these crimes and remains at the forefront of developing new laws and techniques to combat perpetrators' activities as they develop in the internet age. UKIP supports the thrust of this report but cannot, as a matter of principle, concede to the EU the right to determine UK criminal law. For that reason we have abstained. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, we have been here before. Remember the Lisbon Agenda – the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world leading to more and better jobs, a 10-year programme which started in 2000? Where is it? It failed, of course: simply because you keep on thinking you can solve a problem by central decree. Sorry, it does not work that way. Such programmes need a written plan, and then rules and regulations, and there we go: straight into the red tape jungle. If you could only understand that: cut the red tape and all the restrictive regulations, and let people get on with what they do best – making things and selling them. Once again, I must remind you that big business can cope with red tape and can afford compliance officers and well-paid lawyers to bail them out if they make a mistake. SMEs, which employ half the workforce, do not have those resources, so when they get into trouble, they fold. Another one or two jobs go, and fewer youngsters are taken on to learn a trade. Take this morning’s farce in the vote on tyres for motor vehicles and trailers – not really a farce: it is another headache for the motor trade. For how many small garages will this be the last straw before they go under? This whole agenda is another one-size-fits-all idea, or rather, one-size-that-fits-no one. The euro is one of those: now falling apart before your eyes, and all you can think of is to try more of the same. The first casualties of that disaster are, of course, the SMEs – and more jobs are lost. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, I would like to ask the Minister how he can justify this proposal to treble maternity pay by requiring firms to pay new mothers their full salary for 20 weeks. Does he not know we are in the middle of one of the worst recessions of modern times? This will present businesses with the prospect of a 2 billion burden. Even my government opposes this move. In addition, Minister, you plan to extend minimum parental leave from three months to four months for each parent. That is separate from the maternity leave, with one month of the four not transferable to the other parent. Is the Council prepared to compromise on main issues like the duration of maternity leave and the level of payment? Otherwise, you intend to give Member States two years to amend their laws – though how you can say ‘their’ laws, I do not know. This comes straight from the Commission factory, and we shall oppose this job-destroying proposal. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund was invented to persuade Member States to adopt Lisbon without national referendums, but this expensive project has insufficient checks. In Antwerp, General Motors claimed EUR 9.5 million from the EGAF. Their redundant workers received EUR 150 000 each and then some found work with Volvo nearby. Of the five countries with negative growth, three have put in no claims, while stronger economies have, with Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria leading the way, and several more this week. Many firms are closing due to trade moving to the Far East. Glasfiber in Denmark closed because their manufacturer of wind turbines moved to China. This does not happen just because Chinese workers are on low pay; indeed, on Tuesday in this House, the Commissioner discounted that. More to the point, what he said was that China’s central bank sets its own interest rates, while the exchange rates make Chinese products more attractive on world markets. EU manufacturers will struggle on world markets if euro membership makes their products too expensive – ask Greece! Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, the Rio +20 Earth Summit 2012 sounds important – but is it really? The Socialist one-world agenda has been having a hard time of it of late. Global problems require global solutions: sounds good. But global governance through scare stories about man-made global warming has fallen flat. People in the UK, US and China are hugely disbelieving. Everybody knows that CO2
 is not the cause of the ice ages coming and going. So how can a little extra CO2
 be a problem now, whether or not it causes a little extra global warning? Is not a little warming a good thing? Would anyone here really prefer icebergs in the Channel and polar bears in Brussels? The same goes for the even more vague scare stories that have been peddled using meaningless rhetoric since Rio twenty years ago. No one knows what sustainable development really means – and who would want unsustainable development anyway? The environmentalists’ ‘ban everything accept windmills’ attitude is going to send us back to the Middle Ages unless we put a stop to it. You are calling in this document for tangible actions and accountable targets, but of course that is all just Soviet five-year plans all over again. It is about time we recognised these failed Communist policies for what they are and go back to the honest free-market approach which creates wealth for all by innovation and hard work, not by endless interfering and political tinkering.

 – Madam President, yet another expensive, bureaucratic monster arises by combining VIS, SIS and Eurodac, whether or not any Member State currently participates in these agencies. It is meant to develop Schengen, which itself is under pressure due to the Libyan situation. What is the use of a system to allow free movement which has to be partially suspended because of the free movement it encourages? I understand there will be a central agency to retain fingerprints and biometric records for five years, including material obtained under SIS – ‘information regarding certain categories of persons and property’. So, under the guise of facilitating the free movement of people, we have a resurrection of the Stasi. Of course, this is intended to lead to EU immigration control. In the case of the UK, many immigrants come from the Commonwealth, a unique voluntary association including every single one of our former colonies. Well, we have our own border controls for that purpose, and the EU does not have the right to interfere. Derek Roland Clark,

 Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues. In the UK in May 2008, the Misleading Marketing Regulations came into force. They outlaw using the small print of any document to hide the true cost of a service. So the Office of Fair Trading can now take action against UK companies, but there is a serious drawback. The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints. More to the point, while they may operate elsewhere due to lax policing, why can my own government not prevent what comes from mainland Europe? The answer to that lies at the heart of this useless EU, which has demolished national frontiers. The free movement of people, goods and services provides perfect cover for the people traffickers, the terrorists and for threatening, traumatising scams aimed at fleecing the unwary.

– I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments. UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent, have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy. Unfortunately, the Niebler report fails to meet these criteria. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

What do we need expensive promotions for? As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: ‘United in Diversity’. Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire? Do not push EU culture; make Italian, German, French, Dutch, British and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them, and the rest will follow. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, this review’s 10 principles include helping SMEs to benefit from opportunities of the single market, but the eurozone is collapsing, so how can it provide more opportunities? It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets. What growth? In September 2009, I asked Commissioner Andor what specific measures he would introduce to assist SMEs, following my similar request of him when he spoke to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on taking up the portfolio. I got no answers then, but now it seems I have some. The review’s five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations. The first principle of the review – creating a right environment – should not mean proposing new rules such as European private companies and state aids. It should mean ripping rules out by the hundred. After all, Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year: ‘red tape is strangling SMEs’. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 Mr President, after 30 years, the destructive practice of discards is to be addressed. Fleets at Grimsby are a few dozen fishing boats, where once there were a hundred. Two years ago West of Scotland fishermen tabled a plan to conserve white fish but, while they wait, stock depletion continues. A regional approach is suggested – why not? The EU divides the land into regions. Much worse is the renewal of licences for European fleets to raid the waters of the Comoros islands – and raid it will be, for local fishermen cannot compete with the superior EU-powered trawlers. The same thing has been done to others in that area. Is the House surprised that Somali fishermen denied a living have resumed the age-old vice of piracy? Five years ago, did Members see the TV pictures of hundreds of Western Saharans trying to seek refuge in the Canaries? EU licences had just been renewed for their waters and they too had seen it all before. In a pitiful, desperate attempt many died on the 800-mile journey in fishing boats never intended for the open sea. However, the EU does not care that people from the least-developed countries have been impoverished by its actions and, for that, it deserves to be condemned. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report claims that European solidarity and economic development will be threatened by a reduction of the budget. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory – that is why I voted against a freeze – when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break.

– Mr President, this goes beyond Ireland. Only a month ago, I reminded the House that pensions were exclusively the competence of the Member States and here we go again using the same language of coordination and retirement-setting mechanisms. Now pensions are almost always related to earnings, so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages? I hope not, because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States. It is all very well to say that ‘equal’ must mean equal pay, but should all workers doing the same job get the same pay across the EU? As an example, think ‘climate’: keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries. Add in winter clothing, snow clearance and all the rest and it is obvious that to pay all workers the same would leave some with more spare cash than others. Of course wages cannot be equal. The Commission’s intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties. I am not surprised: this is the EU at work. A harmonised wage and pensions policy is not just a dream; it is illegal. Leave it, as the Treaties demand, to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, my point of order regards the first two votes we have today on the calendar for next year and the year after. I have two points to raise, if you please. First of all, these votes simply illustrate how powerless this Parliament really is. Everybody here thinks they are getting more and more power, and more and more influence. But, in point of fact, these amendments are simply to get round the fact that we are obliged to have 12 part-sessions … (The President cut off the speaker) Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, this question mentions a territorial dimension with reference to other policies, including the CFP, which is a complete EU disaster. Fish stocks in the North Sea, part of the Atlantic, have been ruined by discards, which must be abolished. They should never have been contemplated in the first place. UK fishermen have carefully looked after fish stocks in their own territorial waters while others have ruined theirs by overfishing. No wonder the CFP was welcomed by other Member States, whose fishermen could not wait to get into the North Sea. One needs more territorial exclusion, not less. In my own region – the East Midlands – the fishermen of Boston have fished the Wash for generations, looking after the fish stocks and making sure that their trawl nets do not disturb the sea bed, for they know that this is where the immature shellfish develop and that this is where the creatures form the bottom of the food chain. This is their livelihood. Now they are forbidden to fish, on the pretext that their trawls damage the sea bottom. Meanwhile, a Dutch vessel is licensed to hoover up a million tonnes of gravel from the same sea bed, while E.ON is to dig a trench right through to the open sea to lay the line for a useless offshore wind farm. How much damage will all that do to the sea bed? How much longer will these fishermen be forced to stand by and watch their fishing grounds reduced to nothing while they are reduced to being benefit claimants? Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 22 November last year, the rapporteur said that pensions were exclusively a competence of the Member State. Now this has become something more like: although Member States have the lead, there are aspects where coordination at European level is important. In paragraph 9, the resolution stresses Member States’ competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies. There is double speak here, with EU control overturning principle. The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive – by 90% according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall. If that is exaggerated, it is certainly true that huge extra sums will be needed to prevent pensions collapsing, so premiums will rise massively. Pension firms and Member States do not need this report; they need help to keep premiums down. Otherwise, this misguided report has the potential to destroy that which it seeks to protect.

 The UK Independence Party fully supports the cause of genuine human rights. However, we note that the EU’s interpretation of human rights is a flawed one. From votes for prisoners to refusing to deport terrorist hate preachers, all in the name of ‘human rights’, the EU has damaged Britain, and now wishes to spread this throughout the world, using our taxpayers’ money. This is why we cannot support this measure. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– Mr President, I am happy to read this speech on behalf of Mr Bloom, who has – in my view – been unfairly debarred from the Chamber this afternoon. We had a fiasco a year ago in Copenhagen, when 15 000 unqualified people, including MEPs and the whole entourage, descended on the place to double its carbon footprint for a fortnight and got hopelessly embroiled in climategate, which was very neatly timed to scotch the proceedings. Yes, we all remember the University of East Anglia getting shown for what it is: a centre of bogus science churned out by bought and paid-for scientists who rely on the EU’s Research DG and the UN’s ‘super quango’ for research funds and laboratories and on the UK taxpayers for their wages. They were shown up as forgers of data, forgers of climate computer models, hiders of inconvenient data and conspirators with Obama’s green minions. The taxpaying masses learned in no uncertain terms that the EU and the global green agenda is all about raising our carbon taxes and scaring us into compliance. Cancún would be not nearly as bad, of course. It is much warmer. It is a jolly winter, and the conspirators will be much more careful to hide their global governance agenda this year.

– Considering the illegitimacy, undemocratic structure, corruption and megalomaniac ulterior motivation of the European Union in general and the Commission, in particular, we of the UKIP cannot condone the Commission’s monopolisation of public funds for any purpose whatever and believe, consequently, that any monies it directs to the repair of last year’s flood damage in Ireland will not be properly used and will merely conceal the need for relief funding that is correctly disbursed and directed by democratically elected governments. Gerard Batten, John Bufton, Derek Roland Clark, Trevor Colman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries, as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines. However, in this case, the EU is making special arrangements for governments, outside of normal State aid rules, for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines. Amendment 25 and 36 are calling for a greater period of such flexibility before normal State aid laws would apply, which UKIP can go some way to support. UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because, although we do not support any EU State aid laws because it should be up to national governments to decide on subsidy levels, giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable, putting power back in to the hands of governments to make these decisions.

– I voted against the Gauzès report on the AIFM Directive because it disadvantages an important part of the United Kingdom’s most important industry – financial services. It has lumped all funds not already covered by the UCITS Directive, from investment trusts to hedge funds, in a single mixed bag of expensive legislation. It also has created burdens for European managers and investors in Europe that third countries do not place on their managers and investors. This will inevitably mean a loss of talent from London to countries outside the EU. As usual, EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players. By punishing private equity funds, it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy. It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments. The capital requirements will be especially burdensome to PE and venture capital. Venture capital is needed to create new jobs in start-ups. Derek Roland Clark and Paul Nuttall  (EFD

– Regarding the proposal in general, UKIP do not accept the legitimacy of this directive as it should be for elected national governments to decide welfare and social policies. This directive will bring unbelievable costs to employers and the government, which we can ill afford at this time. This will also further the discrimination of women by making them even more costly to hire than they already are, especially for small businesses which are the backbone of the UK economy. UKIP is furthermore sympathetic to parents with disabled children and those choosing to adopt. However, the EU has no right to create such rules on maternity and cannot be allowed the legitimacy to do so. UKIP voted against this directive to ensure that legislation is accountable through the ballot box and not through Brussels bureaucrats. Derek Roland Clark,

– Madam President, poverty, especially the number of those at risk of poverty, has grown as the EU has grown, with each new Member State adding to the problem, so it is pretty obvious how to prevent further increases. One of your answers is to introduce a minimum income. I am in favour of a minimum wage, but only as set by each country for itself. A pan-EU minimum wage would distort the issue. In Scandinavia, for example, domestic heating must be more expensive for all income groups than in southern Europe. I oppose a minimum income because that means public funds to top up a low wage: more for the taxpayer to find in an economic crisis. How do you stop some employers paying less than they might because they know the benefit system will make it up? Answer: more regulations and red tape for businesses, falling most heavily on the SMEs who, between them, employ half the workforce. And, of course, minimum income harmonised across the EU will be followed by a harmonised tax system, reducing all to a grey amorphous mass, devoid of Europe’s greatest property: diversity. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, what is the Commissioner thinking about? Has the Commission been asleep for the last two years? Here we are, at a time of economic stringency, despite what Mr Van Rompuy said this week. There are millions out of work, some newer Member States have still not got the promised financial package, and Germany has a billion-euro bill round its neck to underwrite the Greek economy. In Britain, my government is raising taxes, freezing public sector pay and pensions and cutting back on welfare while finding GBP 45 million every day for this place. And now you want to spend EUR 1.1 billion of hard pressed European taxpayers’ money on a programme to help partner countries along the EU borders. Is that what you mean by more Europe – or is it an attempt to draw these countries into the EU? It sounds like empire-building to me. After all, José Barroso himself called this an empire. We are told that the EU is to prevent further wars in Europe, but if you look at the record you will find that such wars were due to the empire-builders. Now you are doing it all over again. Do you never learn? John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– In voting for this measure, there is no endorsement of the system of VAT. What is clear is that the timetable set for the introduction of an electronic refund procedure and a single refund request was, in practice, unrealistic – and many taxpayers and small businesses might lose as a consequence. This essential measure recognises this and, in doing so, recognises the central role of Member States – arguably hands power back to them if only for six months. It also stops an unrealistic timetable causing the UK’s and other Member States’ SMEs from financially suffering due to EU incompetence. For these reasons, we are voting for it. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, the only guideline is for the EU to stop interfering. The Working Time Directive is a disincentive to work. Why cannot you let people work overtime when they want to? Please do not tell me that this is to protect workers from exploitation, when the EU’s puppet court, the ECJ, has ruled in favour of companies exploiting groups of workers by paying them less than a minimum wage in no less than four countries. Are you aware that more than a fifth of newly qualified junior doctors in the UK are turned down because the WTD means they lack experience and that more are dropping out of training for the same reason? This House passed a report on independent truck drivers recently which will result in many of them packing it in. In voting today, MEPs have approved a paragraph in the Bové report – which will add a massive reporting burden to SMEs – hours after President Barroso had complained that SMEs were being strangled by red tape. The EU is the problem, not the answer, as the people of Europe are beginning to realise. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 UKIP voted against the Alvaro report today because we do not want to give the EU greater power over personal data. This measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy. Confidential and private financial data belongs to the individual and not to the EU or the European Parliament. We are resolutely opposed to the spread of terrorism, but personal confidentiality must be protected where there is no prior suggestion of wrong-doing. If the UK is to enter into an agreement with the US it must be a fully reciprocal arrangement and not the almost one-way-traffic one that the EU has signed up to here. This is a matter for national governments to decide, and not for the European Parliament. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

 I abstained on the vote on Amendment 80 because, while the case for national governments to scrutinise the control of EEAS must be guaranteed, this amendment also guaranteed the right of the European Parliament to do the same.

– UKIP voted against Amendments 1 and 29 so as to restore the Commission’s intention to exclude independent drivers from this directive. We believe that requiring independent drivers to account for the time spent arranging their schedules and bidding for new business will be impossible to monitor, especially when this is done at home, as well as using part of their allocated maximum working hours per week. This will result in less driving, causing them to become less competitive and resulting in unemployment. UKIP also believes in the freedom of individuals to set up in business and to work for themselves, but this directive will prevent that from taking place. Since this is not a health and safety issue, the only winners will be big businesses. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the Sommer report in the European Parliament because it is badly drafted, with inadequate definitions. The country of origin statement was badly worded, giving rise to confusion. UKIP policy is to support country of origin labelling to help producers and consumers to know with certainty where their food is coming from. We rejected the report because it fails to defend the interests of farmers and consumers, while allowing large retailers to confuse the public. UKIP believes MEPs are acting without sufficient information on this matter. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, it is essential that Amendment 30, with special regard to paragraph 7(a), be adopted. Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions. It is not a road safety issue. All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph. Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency. Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business. If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers. Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector. The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce. I therefore support the rapporteur in Amendment 30 as well as the Commission in this respect. You do not hear that very often from this part of the House.

– UKIP regards the safety of nuclear power generation as being of great importance, but perceives the EU’s assistance to Bulgaria, ostensibly for this purpose, as being motivated by political considerations (preventing the reprocessing of fissile material, conveniently close to Bulgaria, in neighbouring Russia) and doctrinaire ones (the imposition of unrealistic wind-power policies) as well as by a desire to fund local conservation projects, which are not relevant to the remit of decommissioning. Consequently, UKIP members have voted against the extra funding asked for in this report. John Bufton  (EFD

– We oppose the Union for the Mediterranean. This would facilitate mass immigration from impoverished countries in North Africa.

– UKIP believes that ongoing development and improvement in the present international network of facilities and agencies for organ exchange will not be facilitated by the EU’s attempts to invade and regulate this network. On the contrary, organ donation in the few countries where there are many donors is likely to decrease if demand for organs from the many countries where there are few donors becomes EU-mandatory. In the latter countries, moreover, the resulting relative abundance of foreign organs is likely to reduce organ donation there also. Consequently, UKIP members voted against this report. Derek Roland Clark,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, why does this report seek more international cooperation at university level? Universities have shared information with each other for centuries, before the EU existed. The Renaissance, spanning the 14th to 17th centuries, was a surge in intellectual development spreading from Florence right across Europe through the universities. The arts, music, literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today. So what of modernisation? Do you look for the technological developments of the future? If so, the scene today is just as promising. Universities elsewhere may be overtaking us, but they owe their beginnings to European universities. This tide of higher education often returns home. The universities of Britain take postgraduate students from across the world, pursuing their studies further and sharing their information, not least with commerce and industry. But we do not need to politicise higher education through programmes such as the Bologna and the Erasmus processes. We do not need programmes on multiculturalism or multilingualism or any other ‘-ism’, that will happen anyway as students from around the world meet and mix on campus. If you wish to serve the modern and future worlds, see that universities are funded properly, encourage those students who wish to study abroad, then simply leave them all alone to get on with it.

– Madam President, in anticipation of your calling the next vote on the Lehne report on deontology, may I please ask why this vote is being taken? It was due for debate last night under catch-the-eye. That was cancelled, so here we are voting on something which has not been debated, although it does not say so. For your information, Madam President, when this came before the Employment Committee a short while ago, nobody on that committee knew what deontology meant until I tried to explain it to them – not even the Chair! I think it is highly improper, therefore, to take a vote on this unknown, undebated motion. Derek Roland Clark  (EFD

– UKIP voted against the report on simplification of the CAP because, although the implementation of the report would make the policy more comprehensible, transparent and workable, simplifying farm inspection, adding to flexibility to payment arrangements and making it more farmer friendly, to do so is to keep the CAP on track and potentially help to extend it for another generation!

However, we cannot support the EU using people-trafficking as a pretext to harmonise immigration and border policies over the heads of elected governments. It must be up to electorates through the ballot box, and elected politicians, to decide national policy on these matters, not for the EU to make yet another policy grab that will take away democratic accountability. If there were not open borders within the EU, and each country had its own immigration policy, serious organised crime and people-trafficking would be much easier to stamp out.

– UKIP is gravely concerned with the situation in Iran and calls for governments on both sides to come to a diplomatic, but above all, peaceful solution to the ongoing political and humanitarian breakdown in the country. The EU must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate the tense situation. Unaccountable EU bureaucrats, instead of elected politicians leading the negotiations, will end up with a bad outcome for Iran and the rest of the world. Negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments, not forced upon from above by the EU.

Of course, we encourage government and individuals to give relief and money to help those affected and rebuild the country. However, this must be done transparently with the public and not by secretive, unelected bureaucrats with international ambitions of grandeur. Derek Roland Clark,

– Mr President, like charity, rights begin at home. I ask about the rights of Europeans Sikhs. Because they wear the kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger, beneath their clothing, they have been prevented from entering the European Parliament. The kirpan is an act of faith which they may not remove, so their exclusion is a matter of religious and racial intolerance. In successive years, I have written to each of the two previous Presidents and the Commission who all replied that the exclusion is on security grounds. In celebrating her diamond jubilee, Queen Elizabeth came to my region, the East Midlands, where in their place of worship in Leicester, she talked to Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan, standing as close to them as you are to your colleagues. I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago, I was at the Palace of Westminster. There, in our democratic parliament, very close to both the House of Lords and to the House of Commons, I met several Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan. With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know. His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears, fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours. As a result, you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place. So what of the Lisbon Treaty which speaks of a Union founded on respect for freedom, equality, the rights of minorities, values of non-discrimination?

− I acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, and deplore the refusal of the UK Government to assist its farming community on this important issue. This report contained provisions related to this situation. However, this report also contained provisions totally unrelated to farming, which would have had a disastrous impact on the UK. In particular, this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol, agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law. It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts. Thus, I could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains my vote on the subject. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Thursday 17April is the 30th anniversary of the murder of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher in London. She was killed in a hail of shots into a crowd from the Libyan Embassy. The murderer has so far not been brought to justice. Information has come to light that a suspect living in Jordan has confessed to the murder and his identity is known to the British security services and to the Metropolitan Police. So far, no action has been taken by the British authorities to question him and, if the evidence so demands, to request his extradition from Jordan to face trial. Contrary to popular belief, most of those in the Libyan Embassy at the time did not have diplomatic immunity and the suspect is not protected. PC Yvonne Fletcher deserves justice and the British authorities must now make every effort to bring her murderer to justice without further delay. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the Stockholm Programme includes the objective of constructing an EU system of criminal law. It is laughable that the EU should presume to create an area of so-called freedom, security and justice in England. The English already did that for themselves over the last 800 years and it served as a model for much of the civilised world. That system is now being subverted because of our subordination to an inferior continental system. This report euphemistically refers to the various so-called imbalances within the emerging EU system. These imbalances are caused by the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition which states that all EU Member Statesʼ police, judicial and penal systems are of equal value. This is absolute nonsense and is causing a growing number of cases of gross injustice. To protect ourselves, Britain must leave the European Union. And to bring that day forward the British can vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, the EU intends to create a Public Prosecutor’s Office with vast legal powers across the Member States. The British Government has already announced that it will opt out of the public prosecutor scheme. However, the Government has already announced that it intends to permanently opt in to the 35 EU police and criminal justice measures. As I said here last month, those 35 measures are the most important and the most dangerous to our traditional freedoms and liberties. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the Government’s decision to opt out of the Public Prosecutor’s Office is both worthless and dishonest. The Prosecutorʼs Office will have at their disposal the use of all the existing legal instruments, such as the European Arrest Warrant, and the new ones, such as the European Investigation Order. Although the Prosecutorʼs Office will have no direct authority in the UK, it will have de facto power by means of the use of these legal instruments. The Tory-led coalition Government knows it cannot defend accepting the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the UK, so it seeks to achieve the same thing by the back door. There is still time for the Government to reverse its decision and opt out of the 35 measures. But to fully protect ourselves, we have to leave the European Union. To do that, vote UKIP on 22[nbsp ]May. Gerard Batten,

  We hear a lot about fundamental rights in this place. In England we had very good fundamental rights long before we joined the European Union. These were established over centuries under Habeas corpus
, the Bill of Rights, the presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt, to name just a few. These safeguards are now being destroyed by the creation of the EU’s own system of criminal justice. The European Arrest Warrant has been the cause of numerous cases of gross injustice, and these will continue to grow. Now we have the European Investigation Order, which will empower foreign police forces to require British police forces to carry out investigations on their behalf, which we will then have the privilege of paying for. The coalition government has the option to opt out of the existing 135 EU criminal justice measures. Instead it has announced its decision to opt out of 100 but opt in to 35. The 100 they are opting out of are of no consequence, being purely rhetorical, redundant or superseded by later legislation. The 35 measures they are opting in to are the worst and most dangerous, including the European Arrest Warrant. None of this is necessary, because there are already existing mutual assistance measures in place that allow police forces and judicial systems to cooperate with each other across national borders. This is not about cooperation. It is about harmonising our legal system in pursuit of the great ideological goal of a United States of Europe. If David Cameron is serious about repatriating power from the EU, he has the golden opportunity to do so now. There is still time to change the decision and opt out of all these measures, thereby protecting the real interests and freedoms of the British people. But I fear the Tories will do what they always do and sell their fellow countrymen down the river to the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Claude, can I ask you to retract something that you said in that speech? You referred to the Crete case and Mr[nbsp ]Hughes and you said that his attackers are on trial in Greece. No, those accused of attacking him are on trial in Greece and they are innocent until proved guilty. Some of them have alibis showing that they were not even present at the place where the attack took place. Nevertheless the lack of evidence against them has not stopped them being extradited. I know that you are a very fair man so would you like to retract the word ‘attacker’ and say ‘accused’ instead? Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Sarah, you spoke about the excessive length of pre-trial detention and I would agree with you: that is to be avoided. But would you agree that one of the reasons for this is because, when people are extradited to Britain, the police must be case-ready. They have to have a case fully prepared to go to trial before they can extradite somebody. Whereas under some continental systems investigative judges may hold people while they investigate, which results in sometimes weeks, months or years of them being detained. Would you agree with me that every police force in the European Union should be case-ready before they request somebody’s judicial surrender? Gerard Batten,

 Madam President, this report calls for a directive which will allow judicial authorities to confiscate someone’s assets without a criminal conviction. What happened to the presumption of innocence until proved guilty? The bedrock of the English constitution is the Bill of Rights, 1689. It clearly says ‘that grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of particular persons before convictions are illegal and void’. That means that no government or judicial authority can impose a fine or take away someone’s property for an alleged criminal activity, but must first secure a criminal conviction in a court of law. The Bill of Rights is a constitutional act and is still in force. Our freedoms and liberties are being eroded and destroyed, and the pretext is always the same: that we have to be protected from crime and terrorism. But the single biggest reason for the increased threat of crime in the UK and Europe is the EU’s open borders policy. Open borders mean that we cannot stop criminals – big and small, organised and disorganised – from coming to our country. Indeed, it will be illegal under the EU’s freedom of movement directives to discriminate against criminals. All UK MEPs should vote against this report. If a directive is adopted, then the British Government should unilaterally refuse to transpose it into UK law. It would be illegal and void. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, on the one hand, it is good for once to be able to agree with the report in that it opposes the merging of the European Police College and Europol. On the other hand, UK Independence Party MEPs cannot vote for it because it calls for yet more powers to be given to Europol. This report wants to increase Europolʼs powers to participate in the investigative and judicial proceedings of Member States.  Europol is of course the European Union’s emerging cross-border police force – the United States of Europe’s own FBI – but there is no need for it, or to enlarge its powers. Bilateral agreements between nation states are a far cheaper and more effective way of achieving the desired results, and by these means nations can retain democratic control and accountability over their own police forces.  Existing mechanisms and Interpol already exist to provide cooperation between the police forces of nation states. Few people in Britain realise that Europol officers have immunity for anything that they do or say in the course of their duties. Such immunity is a concept unknown under English law, where it is a centuries-old principle that no one is above the law. We need genuine cooperation between nation states, police and judicial authorities. We do not need a European police force, leading eventually to a European police state. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Madam President, on 10[nbsp ]February an article by Yasmin Alibhai-Brown appeared in The Independent
 newspaper. The headline described certain people as ‘hideously white’, while the text included a description of them as ‘pompous, backward and white’. These derogatory descriptions associated with race would appear to be an offence under the Race Relations Act. On that basis I have written to the Metropolitan Police.  The Independent 
is, I believe, on sale on the continent. If an EU citizen outside the United Kingdom complained about the article then Mrs Alibhai-Brown could find herself the subject of a European arrest warrant issued under the category of racism and xenophobia. She could find herself locked up for a considerable amount of time on the order of an investigating magistrate while the case is looked into. I would, of course, oppose her judicial surrender under a European arrest warrant as being contrary to the principles of English law. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, this morning President Barroso restated the European Union’s commitment to open borders as a fundamental principle. A sensible immigration policy in Britain would allow entry only to those people we might actually want: people with the skills to fill jobs that genuinely cannot be filled by our own unemployed; people who have a legitimate right to marry British citizens; people who are hardworking and law abiding. Instead, what has the EU given us? We also get criminals, drug addicts, alcoholics, beggars, vagrants and benefit-seekers. Decent British people see their living standards being driven down, while benefits and social housing are given to people who have never paid a penny in tax in the UK. That is what the EU has delivered for us, and next May the voters of Britain will deliver their verdicts on you, fellow Members, when they vote for the UK Independence Party in massive numbers.

Mr President, the subject of public procurement brings to mind the problems with the Brussels hemicycle. The hemicycle was, of course, closed in September 2012 because cracks were discovered in three of the beams holding up the roof. In December 2012 we were told that Parliament was having difficulty in finding a builder to do the repair work. This was, apparently, because they were concerned about the ten-year guarantee required. If the Chamber is reopened in April, as promised, it will have been closed for 18 months. Surely Parliament’s public procurement procedures should have been able to find a builder willing to do the work, given that money is no problem? Some might suspect that the long delay was deliberate, in order to prevent the Brussels Chamber being used as the sole meeting place of this Parliament, thereby ending the monthly and expensively monstrous trek to Strasbourg. If Parliament cannot organise its own public procedure policies, how can it possibly hope to organise everybody else’s? Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, some of you in Europe may need an area of freedom, security and justice. We already had one in England under our Constitution, our common law, protected by such things as the presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, the trial by jury and under the Bill of Rights. These are now being superseded and overridden by the EU creating its own system of civil and criminal law.  Any British citizen can now be carted off to any other EU Member State purely on the strength of a piece of paper: the infamous European Arrest Warrant. All of these rest on the idiotic doctrine of mutual recognition, which says that any EU legal system is equal to any other EU legal system. This is obvious nonsense. The British Government had the opportunity to opt out of 135 of these measures in mid-2014; instead, it intends to opt into the 35 worst and most dangerous. Mr Cameron could have genuinely repatriated some powers; instead, he is going to hand to the EU on a plate powers that endanger all our traditional, centuries-old liberties and freedoms.

 Madam President, this report marks another step on the way to the European Union having its own armed forces. The Treaty on European Union of 1992 laid down the foundations for a common security and defence policy leading to a common defence. Common defence means only one thing: common armed forces, a European army. That goal is being steadily pursued by means of common procurement procedures, common communications systems and common command and control structures.  The British armed forces are being deliberately run down so that their resulting weaknesses can be used as an excuse for eventually merging them into a common EU army. The British army now has fewer soldiers than the German army had after the Versailles Treaty. Meanwhile, they are stretched to breaking point and expected to perform miracles. If Britain’s service men and women understand the writing on the wall, then they will vote en masse
 for the United Kingdom Independence Party. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

I do not think that this actually matters, because ever since I first sat in this Chamber in 2004 – and I spent the first four or five years on the Subcommittee on Security and Defence – it has been obvious that this is the goal that is being pursued. How many other constitutions have been overridden and changed in order to accommodate EU integration? Our own constitution in England is overridden and set aside by what is happening in the European Union, so I do not think they are going to worry about a few other smaller countries’ constitutions when pursuing their ultimate goal.

 Mr President, the regional development funds are some of the most expensive items in the EU budget. These schemes are often just a waste of money, but a waste of money used to promote the EU’s identity as a political state. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has also been a gift to organised crime. In Bulgaria, the mafia profited massively from ERDF funding being channelled into projects in which they have financial stakes. And now the criminals of candidate countries are keen to get in on the action too. The ERDF is a key part of EU propaganda. Legal requirements say that EU flags and placards must be fixed in places where the money has been spent, but there is no such thing as EU money. There is only taxpayers’ money. Member States would be better off spending their own money in their own way in a democratically accountable manner. Britain cannot afford this and it is yet another reason why Britain has to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, in his book In Praise of Folly
, Erasmus castigates various establishment groups of his day, and it still makes amusing reading 500 years later. In his criticism of theologians he says: ‘They will proclaim me a heretic. With this thunderbolt they terrify the people they don’t like. Their opinion of themselves is so great that they behave as if they were already in heaven; they look down pityingly on other men as so many worms. A wall of imposing definitions, conclusions, corollaries, and explicit and implicit propositions protects them. They are full of big words and newly-invented terms.’ It is unintended irony, surely, to associate the name of Erasmus with the European Union, the greatest folly of our age. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, by its nature, citizenship can only be of a political state. All British citizens were made citizens of the European Union in 1993 without their consent. Few realise that this also includes our supposedly sovereign Head of State, Her Majesty The Queen. Under the still-existing English Constitution, the Head of State cannot be subject to a higher political authority. The English monarch is the physical embodiment of the sovereignty of the nation, and that is the fundamental problem at the heart of British membership of the European Union. The British people still imagine that they are a free and sovereign people, and yet they are not. The issue can only be resolved by them, by a democratic decision accepting their new status as a region of the European Union, or by leaving and re-establishing our national democratic independence.

Mr President, if people have been illegally transported across European borders by the CIA, then that is wrong. Every criminal suspect is entitled to open justice and a fair trial. However, this oral question is not about that. It is about asking the Commission to introduce more measures to bring national security services under its control. The public can read more about this plan in the Commission’s own document entitled ‘European Security Strategy: A secure Europe in a better world’, published as part of the Stockholm programme.  These proposals are just another step along the road to creating a United States of Europe. Just as the EU now has its own foreign policy and is taking control of Member States’ armed forces, so it needs control of their security services to complete the picture. The EU does not yet have the power to do that and we must ensure that it never does. Gerard Batten,

Madam President, in the previous debate, Commissioner Malmström, if I heard her correctly, said that she wanted to open up more legal avenues for migration into Europe. Mrs Malmström, why do you not go to countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, France and Great Britain and ask ordinary people how they feel about that? I imagine that the vast majority would tell you that they are ‘immigrationed out’ and that they actually want fewer – not more – waves of people coming to their country. Maybe you should try stepping outside of the Brussels ideological bubble and, dare I use the term, show some solidarity with the ordinary working people of Europe. You talk here about border controls, but you have no intention whatsoever of actually trying to control immigration. Britain is swamped by continual waves of immigration from outside and inside the European Union and the only way we can control that is to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, between 1958 and 1962 tens of thousands of women gave birth to babies with severe birth defects, including missing limbs. The cause of this was the drug Thalidomide, prescribed to pregnant women. In the UK there are about 467 surviving victims. As they age, their health problems are made worse by their disabilities. Some compensation was paid by the Distillers Company Ltd, the UK distributors, but the German inventor of the drug, Grünenthal, has never properly accepted its responsibilities or paid compensation to the British victims. The compensation the victims did receive is now inadequate to meet the rising costs of their care.  The survivors are an extraordinary group of brave, resilient and independent people. All they want is for Grünenthal to face up to its responsibilities and to arrive at a fair settlement. Please register your support for the Thalidomide victims’ campaign by going to their website http://www.showyourhand.org" . This gross injustice has gone on for 50 years too long. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, it has long been the reality that the USA could intercept any electronic communication anywhere in the world but the advent of the Internet and digital communications has created a whole new treasure trove of information which can be plundered by the security services. The reason that so many terrorist attacks in the UK and elsewhere have been thwarted is precisely because the security services have accessed the terrorist communications. Now that is on the plus side, but on the minus side the state now has the technical means to know almost everything about individual citizens. Now the challenge for democratic nation states is to ensure that access to personal information is only used according to strict legally established and internationally observed rules which protect the individual from the state. What we do not need is the EU using this issue to further assert its pretentions to be a political state. Equally it does not help that the British Government is now nothing more than a lapdog of the USA. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, I think that it was the IRA who said to the security services ‘you have to win every time, we only have to win once’. The security services have a tremendously difficult job in thwarting these attacks, and in the UK we know that there have been many – some we know about and some we do not – which have been stopped because of the security services’ ability to look at people’s communications. I think there are two issues here. There is the issue of what they can do by looking at people’s communications, and then there is this totally indiscriminate collecting of information on everybody, which I think is extremely dangerous. Can you imagine if Hitler, Stalin or Mao had had access to this information? I do not think that I am disagreeing with you; we probably agree more than we disagree on this. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, there is no rule of law in Russia. The Russian Government is a gangster regime which is successfully exporting the rule of lawlessness to the West. Meanwhile Western Governments follow a policy of appeasement. In 2006 agents of the Russian State murdered my constituent Alexander Litvinenko in an act of state-sponsored terrorism. David Cameron has broken his earlier promises to help uncover what happened; instead, he has made a deal with President Putin. The British Government is to withhold vital evidence from the coroner’s court proving the involvement of the Russian State. Russia blatantly murders people on the streets of London and the British Government agrees to look the other way.  Law enforcement in Russia is just a tool of organised crime. Any cooperation with Russia in security and legal matters should be out of the question until the rule of law is properly established there. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, last year we saw the Schengen system buckle under the strain of mass migration, and some Member States sought to introduce unilateral controls. The revision of the rules is an attempt to keep the lid on a boiling pot, but it is too little and too late. It only allows some controls in very exceptional circumstances for a limited period of time. It is too little, too late.  An open-borders policy could only work between countries with very similar and stable economic and cultural natures. The EU’s open-borders policy is a disaster for ordinary people, and has created enormous social problems. This has all been done in pursuit of a political ideology not shared by the people of Europe. That ideology is that the continent of Europe is a single country, a United States of Europe, which obviously it is not. The EU is out of touch with reality and in a contest between reality and ideology, reality always wins in the end.

Mr Goebbels, you asked about border controls. Yes, Britain is not in the Schengen system, but we still suffer from the effects of it because it is very much easier for people to get to Calais and make that final hop over to Britain. You are quite right: even though we are supposed to have border controls, immigration policy is a disaster in my country. This is not just because of the European Union, it is because of the complete inability and lack of will on the part of British governments to actually put in proper immigration controls and carry them out. So I agree with you that this is a disaster in my country that is not entirely of the making of the EU. In answer to Ms Morvai’s question regarding the free movement of people: no, we do not believe in the free movement of peoples in my party. We believe in controlled immigration and controlled border policy. We do not want to stop immigrants; we do not want to stop people coming. But we want this to be controlled by our government in the interests of the British people, and not in the interests of a political ideology which they do not share. If you are going to control people, it is a lot easier to do that than capital, which is often numbers on a computer, so I understand the problems there. We want to see policies in a whole range of areas that are in the interests of the British people, and then ultimately in the interests of everybody else. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, the economies of Europe are in deep crisis, and unemployment is reaching record levels. But there is one boom industry offering unprecedented employment opportunities. That of course is organised crime. This report recognises the seriousness of the situation and offers the solution we have come to expect on every occasion, namely a common European approach and more harmonised laws. But it is precisely the common European approach that has helped create the problem in the first place. Every annual Europol organised crime threat assessment report since 2009 has said that the root cause for the growth of organised crime across Europe is the EU’s own open-borders policy. This report suggests the creation of an ‘intelligence training centre’. However, the intelligent thing to do would not be to set up another institution expanding the power of the EU, but to reintroduce border controls to prevent the free movement of criminals in the first place.

Mr President, I would like to apologise in advance for digressing from the subject of this debate and using my time to make reference to a shocking incident that has happened in my constituency, London, today. There has been a particularly cowardly and disgusting terrorist murder of a man in Woolwich. Initial reports indicate that the victim appears to be a member of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. I am sure that all of you, like me, will offer your deepest sympathy to the victim’s family, friends and colleagues. It is not possible to express the depth of outrage that all decent people will feel at this latest expression of barbaric and mindless terrorism. This crime will be condemned by all decent people.

Mr President, as this question makes clear, the report calls for the Commission to publish its proposals on a voluntary permanent Union relocation scheme, as promised since December 2011. It is the intention of this scheme that Member States can request assistance in the relocation of refugees and asylum seekers across EU borders. The UK, of course, has a long history of accepting refugees and asylum seekers in very significant numbers over centuries. If the proposed scheme is voluntary then what is the point? Member States could continue to determine their own responses to particular circumstances in relation to their own ability to respond, which is exactly what they should do. Asylum and immigration policy should remain under national control. It is easy to understand why the Commission does not want to come up with a scheme that will be unworkable in any case.

 Madam President, the next meeting of the Bilderberg Group is to be held in England. The location is thought to be the Grove Hotel, Watford, and the dates to be 6 to 9 June 2013.

The biggest mystery surrounding them is why the mainstream newspapers and broadcasters have chosen not to report on them since 1954. In the internet age, however, their existence can no longer be kept secret. I have written to all the mainstream media outlets in the UK asking them if they intend to report on this meeting and if not, why not.

 Madam President, this is just a public relations exercise to paint a veneer of democracy over the undemocratic European Union. The best definition of democracy that I know of was given by Abraham Lincoln, who said that it was ‘government of the people, by the people and for the people’. There are no common people in Europe; there is no political identity with which they can identify, so you can never have a true democratic system in the European Union as a whole. The only democracy that makes any sense is the democracy of nation states, where people identify with a common political identity. All democratic governments in different countries take different forms. They all have different structures. But in order for a country to be called a democracy, it must have one single characteristic: the ability not only to elect the government but also to sack the government and replace it with a different government. Of course, that is the one thing you cannot do in the European Union. The people do not select the Commission, who are the effective government of the European Union, and they cannot sack them. Therefore no country that is a member of the European Union can claim to be a functioning democracy. We are seeing our democracies destroyed. All the governments of the western world, and in particular those of the European Union, are disconnecting from their own people and imposing policies on them which they do not want – like mass uncontrolled immigration and idiotic climate change legislation, which is destroying their economies. The only Citizens’ Initiative which makes any sense is the initiative to leave the European Union. People in Britain have the opportunity to do that by voting for the UK Independence Party, and they are doing it in increasing numbers. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, why does Turkey want to join the European Union in the first place? I expect she hopes to benefit from EU handouts and subsidies like so many before her. As a relatively poor country, I also expect that she hopes to offload some of her poorest citizens – her surplus population – by means of mass immigration under the EU’s open borders policy. Turkey has over 72 million people, and if she joins the EU we can expect a large number of them to migrate to countries like Britain. Perhaps they will come to work, or to go on the benefits or housing system again like so many before them and use our public services. The British public must beware that the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democratic parties are all in favour of Turkish entry and of yet more waves of mass immigration.

Mr President, over the last decade the international community has spent an enormous amount of money in assistance to Kosovo. At a rough estimate this is about EUR 4.7 billion. This includes about EUR 2.3 billion from the European Union and Member States. One of the key targets for this aid has been to combat organised crime and establish the rule of law. Now, how is that progressing? The EU office of criminal intelligence has said that ‘the situation regarding organised crime in Kosovo has not changed considerably since 1999’. A Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly report in December 2010 linked senior Kosovan politicians to criminal gangs involved in human organ trafficking. We already have plenty of criminals from Kosovo in London, despite the fact that it is not yet a member of the EU. EU entry would enable yet more to come. We already have enough, thank you very much.

Mr President, mutual societies and building societies were an excellent idea that originated in 18th century Birmingham, and the idea caught on and enabled millions of people to buy their own homes when otherwise they would have been unable to do so. But they were not intended to be cross-border international entrepreneurial businesses. A much better idea is for individual nation states to adopt the idea and adapt it to fit in with their own national requirements. This statute, if adopted, will mean more unwanted EU legislation and probably lead to unforeseen, unwanted consequences and unintended consequences. If there is any case for international cross-border operation, then there is no reason why this could not be accomplished by sovereign nation states with intergovernmental agreements.

Mr President, if I am in good shape it is not because I play football. I would happily admit that I know absolutely nothing about sport, but I do know a little bit about match-fixing.  First of all, let me say that this report calls for a specialised law enforcement unit to combat match-fixing. Well, I am pleased to tell you we have already got one in the United Kingdom, it is called the police force.  Having said that, in terms of match-fixing, the EU has been involved in a few fixed matches itself. Back in 1975, in the referendum in the UK on membership of the EU, that was a fixed match, when the Central Intelligence Agency of the USA put enormous amounts of money into the ‘Yes’ campaign and there was a concerted effort by the BBC and other organs of the media to actually fix the result. There was a fixed match in 1992 in Denmark when the referendum delivered the wrong result and they were told to go back and have a re-match until they came up with the right result. There was a fixed match in France and Holland on the Constitution when they came up with the wrong result, but rather than have the re-match, actually they changed the terms of the game and declared it a win anyway. And, of course, Ireland had a match fixed when it delivered the wrong result on the Lisbon Treaty, and then had to go back and have a re-match until it got the right result. So if there is going to be some kind of investigative body to look at fixed matches, I suggest we start with the European Union.

 Yes, I happily admit I know nothing about sport. I pretend to have no knowledge of it whatsoever.  In terms of international crime, there is already an international crime organisation called Interpol, which is there to share information, and there are national police forces that are there to pursue crime in their individual nation states. So I cannot see why you need yet another new body to do something that is already catered for by existing police forces and Interpol. I do not know why you imagine that some other body, created by the European Union, is going to be any more efficient than all the other bodies created by the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Regarding the composition of Parliament in 2014, I would like to make one prediction: the UK political party most likely to come first and return the highest number of MEPs will be the UK Independence Party. This will reflect the growing mood of the British population and will be another important milestone on the road to achieving Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, what does social security coordination mean? Does it mean that the benefits systems of all EU states are brought up to the British standard at their taxpayers’ expense? No, it means that the British benefits system is made available to any EU citizen who wants to use it. My constituency – London – particularly feels the impact of foreign claimants on the housing, health and benefits systems. David Cameron has had to respond to public outrage by saying that he wants to limit EU citizens’ access to benefits, but he cannot do so, and he knows it. It is not often that I can agree with an EU Commissioner, but Viviane Reding has said that this is against EU law and that he cannot discriminate on the basis of nationality. England is now the soup kitchen of the world, and the soup is running out. This is just one of the reasons why we have to leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Many of my constituents have contacted me in desperation because their disability payments are being cut or stopped altogether. One lady rang to tell me of her young adult daughter who has a learning disability and whose disability benefit payment was being stopped because she has been assessed as fit for work. She took her daughter to the Job Centre to look for something she might be able to do. She found that all the low-skilled, low-paid jobs were taken, often by migrants without the disadvantage of a disability. In the same queue were EU citizens signing on for the Jobseeker’s Allowance. She asked me to explain why we, as a country, cannot afford her daughter’s benefit but we can afford to pay benefits to migrants from the EU. I told her that this was because our Government’s spending decisions and priorities are not decided in the interests of their own citizens but rather in order to comply with EU law and their ambitions to build a borderless United States of Europe. I further explained that the only solution to the problem is for Britain to leave the European Union. Following our conversation that lady, like some many more people, will be voting for the UK Independence Party at their next opportunity. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr Van Orden, if in your report five years ago you highlighted all these problems – which were very serious problems then and which you now say are still very serious problems and in fact even worse probably than when you wrote your report – why did you then feel it necessary to recommend Bulgarian entry to the EU when it clearly did not fulfil the criteria that one would expect, the most basic criteria about rule of law and democracy in an entrant country?

Mr President, in January 2014 the final restrictions will be lifted on immigration into Britain from Romania and Bulgaria. A further 29 million people will be given the automatic right of entry, and it is estimated that this will result in at least 50 000 extra immigrants per year over the next five years. Britain is already overwhelmed and swamped with immigration because, as a member of the European Union, we have surrendered our right to control it. The British have nothing against Bulgarians or anyone else: we do not blame them for wanting to better their lives. But why do so many Bulgarians want to leave their country? Bulgaria is a desperately poor country under the control of criminals. Let me quote from the New York Times: ‘Politics is played to the death in Bulgaria, where the lives of politicians can be as cheap as spent bullets and murky business groups wage a murderous struggle for their cut of everything from real estate deals to millions in European aid’. Atanas Atanasov, a former counter-intelligence chief, has said, ‘Other countries have the mafia; in Bulgaria the mafia have the country’. How can democracy prosper under these conditions? There is a lack of a free media and press, a corrupt judiciary and legal system, widespread electoral fraud and criminal control of business. It is no surprise that many Bulgarians will choose to move somewhere else. One good thing that the EU did do was to suspend payments to Bulgaria. It is not right to send millions in aid for their criminals to plunder and make them richer. I feel desperately sorry for decent Bulgarians, but I feel even sorrier for my own country, which is being destroyed by membership of the European Union. The British political establishment is dedicated – or seems dedicated – to turning Britain into a third-world country. Britain cannot solve Bulgaria’s problems by importing Bulgarians.

Yes Mrs Dodds, I would agree with you. I think that we should designate groups like that as terrorism because the last thing that we want to see is what happened in Northern Ireland. Terrorism and politics often go hand in hand and I would hate to see it happen in my country, as it did in Northern Ireland, that the terrorists actually propel people into government, where they are now. Of course, I would like to see action taken against Islamic fundamentalism wherever it raises its head because it goes hand in hand with terrorism. In London we now have Sharia patrols intimidating people on the street on what they can or cannot do or can or cannot wear, and gays have been intimidated in the Bethnal Green area. I think it is very important, I take your point and I totally agree with you. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, this report proposes a regulation to reduce noise from motor vehicles and, like all legislation from this place, it will entail more bureaucracy and cost. For example, the report says that the quality of road surfaces may be the solution to the problem. Perhaps, but how much would it cost to alter them? Given the current state of Member States’ finances, one wonders where they would find the money to carry out this momentous task.  This is a regulation. It will have automatic, binding, legal effect in every Member State. Democratically elected national governments do not have the right to decide whether they want to apply it or not: they have no choice. Perhaps control of noise pollution is one of those powers that David Cameron wants to renegotiate the return of to the British Parliament, among those many thousands of others long ago surrendered to the European Union. Meanwhile, he must continue to obey his masters in Brussels. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, Mr Imran Firasat is a Pakistani who converted from Islam to Christianity. Spain granted him asylum in 2004 because as an apostate his life was at risk. The Spanish authorities are now threatening to deport him to Pakistan under hate speech laws mandated by the European Commission.  Mr Firasat produced a film entitled ‘The Innocent Prophet’, as part of his critique of Islam. An altered version of the film was released last December without Mr Firasat’s consent. This appears to be the extent of his transgression. If Mr Firasat is deported he may face the death penalty for alleged blasphemy.  Individuals and organisations across Europe and the world are calling on the Spanish authorities not to take any action until Mr Firasat’s lawyers have lodged his appeal with the Spanish High Court. It would be a betrayal of all western liberal and democratic values if Mr Firasat was sent to his death for criticising a belief system. Gerard Batten,

Mr President, this is yet another unwarranted and unnecessary transfer of sovereignty from the nation state to the European Union. There is a highly respected patent court in the UK which is currently worth something like GBP 750 million per annum and this is now in danger. Patent specialists in the UK strongly contend that there is no demand in the UK for this change. There are serious concerns about judicial appointments to the new court and therefore about the quality of the decisions that will be made. Instead of a meritocratic appointment system, it seems that subscribing Member States will be entitled to a judge. Many of the smaller countries have tiny patent jurisdictions, few patent judges and few legal practitioners in this field from whom to choose judges. As with so much legislation from this place, this is being done in favour of very large companies at the expense of small and medium-sized businesses. SMEs and individuals will be seriously disadvantaged in protecting their innovations, by reason of cost and inconvenience, bearing in mind that they will have to go to France and Germany to protect their work rather than to local courts.  We are told that there will be cost savings, but that is not the opinion of experts. One estimate is that litigation costs will increase by a factor of three. UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this measure. ( The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr Karim, of course, unlike you I am not a great devotee of the European Union, but I have got my information from Dr Jochen Pagenberg, who is an expert in the field, admitted to the Munich and Paris Bars; the author was a member of the EU’s Committee of Experts and withdrew from this body by the end of 2011.

Mr President, England had fundamental rights under the common law for centuries before the concept was dreamed of by the European Union, and we do not need the European Convention on Human Rights to bestow them on us. Those ancient rights and liberties are now being destroyed by the creation of an EU system of criminal law, for example under the infamous European Arrest Warrant. What have your fundamental rights given us in return? Suspects against whom no evidence has been presented to a British court can be extradited and imprisoned for months or years without trial. Meanwhile, we have been prevented from extraditing non-British suspect terrorists and criminals to their own countries outside the European Union because of legal judgments made under the Convention. Those of you who lived under Communist dictatorships prior to your joining the European Union might think that this is an improvement. The English do not. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, of course SIS is an international police database system but also associated with this is an EU police organisation called SIRENE (Supplementary Information Request at National Entry). Now this is a little known organisation and it has been described by some of its operatives as top secret. It has executive powers and although Britain is not yet a member of the Schengen Group, the UK is expected to joint SIRENE in 2013. It already has officers working within Member States’ police forces and our German SIRENE officer is attached to the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency and his name is Jan-Per Ruehmann. Under Schengen an alert placed on an SIS database should be treated as a European Arrest Warrant. Therefore within the Schengen area, at least, extradition may now simply be on the basis of the hit on a database. European Arrest Warrants will rise sharply after we join SIS in 2013. If I may conclude: the noble Baroness Ludford referred to a europhobe, possibly myself. I do not hate Europe. I love Europe; I dislike the European Union and what I love most are the ancient liberties of my countrymen which I want to preserve. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 – Mr President, this report seeks to generate a regulation to restrict members of the public from purchasing, and to require notification concerning sales of, a large number of substances which are commonly used for legitimate purposes. Unfortunately, the UK has extensive experience of the use of home-made explosive devices – for example, terrorists have used fertiliser as a basis for bombs for many years. The UK does not need the EU to tell it how to manage the availability of such substances. This is a regulation which seeks to extend the power and dominion of the EU using the prevention of terrorism as a pretext. I and my UKIP colleagues will therefore vote against. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 – Mr President, I would like to comment on an article in today’s Daily Express
 by Leo McKinstry. He writes that the Tory Party should offer some kind of electoral deal to the UK Independence Party. Now UKIP should never accept any such deal for the following reasons: The Tories can never be trusted. They have betrayed Britain for over 40 years and they would betray anyone. If the Tories wanted to offer the British people a referendum on continued membership of the European Union, they could easily do so. They do not need to make any deal with UKIP. If UKIP entered any such pact, it would destroy our credibility with the electorate. UKIP would end up in the same position as the Liberal Democrats, facing electoral annihilation, and the cause of Britain’s exit from the European Union would be lost forever. UKIP must never compromise its campaign to restore Britain’s status as a sovereign, independent, self-governing democracy. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– The horrors of forced abortions in China is just the latest in decades of abuse and torture of Chinese citizens by their communist Party government. We should not forget that since July 20 1999, former Chinese communist party President, Jiang Zemin, ordered the start of the systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which is still going on. The Amnesty International Annual Report 2012 on China, published on 24th May 2012, states that the Chinese authorities continued to pursue a systematic, nationwide, often violent campaign against Falun Gong; The US State department reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 published on 24th May 2012, where it states that overseas and domestic media and advocacy groups continued to report instances of organ harvesting, particularly from Falun Gong practitioners. All of us who care about democratic government should speak out about the last 13 years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China and democratic governments and societies everywhere should send a strong message to the Chinese Government to immediately stop persecuting Falun Gong practitioners in China.

Mr President, since we are discussing justice I would like to raise a disturbing issue that has come to my attention today. Mr Roger Hayes has been summarily sentenced to 21 days in Liverpool prison following a cursory appearance before a magistrate on Monday. Mr Hayes was arrested at 8.30 a.m., taken to court, sentenced and locked up by 6 p.m. that evening. No members of the public or witnesses were reportedly allowed at his hearing. Mr Hayes’ family have reportedly been refused any direct access to him. Mr Hayes is the founder of the British Constitution Group and is a prominent tax protestor. His case arises from his withholding of Council tax on a legally-based objection that the revenue is being illegally used. Mr Hayes’ imprisonment may well be illegal under English common law. Mr Hayes must be freed without delay and the issues behind it widely publicised. I hope this helps. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I have had literally hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails from around the world on this subject, at least 99.9% of them asked me to vote against it. I can assure these people, and especially my constituents in London, that I and my UKIP colleagues will vote against ACTA. But one element of ACTA which particularly concerns me is the criminalisation of offences under Article 23. Of course, genuine copyright and intellectual property right infringements must be prevented and owners’ rights protected, but the European Union is creating its own comprehensive police state with provisions such as the European Arrest Warrant and the European Investigation Order. Criminalisation opens up all kinds of sinister possibilities for suppressing free speech, dissent and alternative points of view. We only have to look at the case of Julian Assange to see where that can lead. All things considered, I urge my colleagues here to vote against ACTA. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, David Cameron has suggested that there might be a referendum on the European Union, but he does not know when and he does not know what the question should be. He only knows what the question will not be: should Britain leave the European Union? This is because he does not know what the EU will look like in the future. But we all know, do we not? Those of us here on both sides of the EU argument know exactly that it is intended to be a single European political state, a United States of Europe. The current eurozone crisis is being used to bring about financial and economic government and full political integration. The only person who apparently does not understand this is David Cameron. The UK Independence Party can explain it to him, exactly as we are explaining it to his voters. The only referendum that the British people want is a straight question on whether we should stay in or get out and we want it sooner rather than later. Gerard Batten,

– Mr President, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania are threatening the EU-Canada trade agreement unless Canada lifts its visa requirement for visitors from those three countries. Canadians do not need visas to visit EU countries, whereas Canada has imposed visa restrictions on these three EU Member States. This is because of a previous influx of people from those countries who outstayed their welcome. Canada takes the quite reasonable view that not all EU countries are the same, and that some pose a particular risk when it comes to unwanted visitors and guests. The Canadians want to pick and choose who they admit and who they do not. However, this realistic view of the world falls foul of the EU ideological view that the EU is, in fact, one country, and to discriminate against one of its regions is not permissible. The Canadian Government already has a very generous system of allowing visa-free entry for 24 EU Member States, but perhaps it has looked at my constituency, London, and seen what a completely unrestricted open-door immigration policy actually delivers. They will not get the visitors and migrants they want – the decent, hard-working and law-abiding – they will also get the down-and-outs, the deadbeats and the criminals. In Marble Arch, the very centre of London, we now have migrants living on the street, with all the unpleasant social and sanitary consequences that involves, which I will leave to your imagination. This is what indiscriminate, visa-free travel can deliver. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement put in jeopardy by Canada’s reluctance to open its doors to allcomers is reputedly worth a potential USD 12 billion per annum, and would boost two-way trade by 20%. What does the world need now? Does it desperately need increased trade? Does it desperately need increased economic activity, jobs and increased prosperity? I think we would all agree that it does. Does it desperately need even more uncontrolled and unlimited migration? Most rational people would think that it does not. Let the Canadians choose who they want to let into their country, and on what terms. Let Canada and Europe get on with increasing the trade between them that can help us all out of the dire economic situation that we find ourselves in. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this report confirms what I have been warning my constituents in London about, and the British people generally, for some years, which is that the EU intends to create its own system of criminal law. This project is already very well advanced and very comprehensive and I have written about it in a report of my own, Freedom, Security &amp; Justice? or The Creation of a European Union Police State
. We do not need an EU system of criminal law in England. We have something called the common law which has taken a thousand years to evolve. We have safeguards under the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights and habeas corpus, which are being swept away under this new system. They are being set aside. A British citizen can now be sent off to any corner of the European Union on the strength of a piece of paper with vague accusations. They can be imprisoned for months or years. The English and Scottish courts have abdicated their duty to protect their own citizens from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. Your system of EU criminal law would do for our liberties what the European single currency has done for your economies. Gerard Batten  (EFD

Mr President, we see increasing moves by governments to limit our personal freedom and privacy, citing the need to protect us from the threat of terrorism and organised crime. However, we have to be extremely cautious in allowing our freedoms to be removed, because once they are gone it is very hard to restore them. We also have to ask if we have any particular reason to trust our governments. Legislation intruding into the citizen’s right to privacy should be proportionate, limited and controlled. Once it is enacted we need to be sure that its scope cannot be widened at the whim of government. This kind of legislation should never have been proposed by the Commission in the first place. It probably comes under the jurisdiction of international law. It should be devised under international agreements by sovereign nation states. The legislation is also unacceptable because it is one-way traffic between Europe and the USA. We have to give them our citizens’ personal information, but they do not have to supply theirs. The motion for a resolution wants the final decision to be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union to rule on its legality and compatibility with the EU Treaties. The UK Independence Party’s MEPs will vote against this legislation. We will not vote in favour of the motion as we do not accept the legitimacy of the European Court. Gerard Batten,

Madam President, last year I wrote to David Cameron urging him to oppose the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The coalition government replied that they were obligated to accede to it and that in any case it would not change the existing situation regarding the UK. EU accession to the ECHR is required under Article 6(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Cameron could have given the decision to the British people by honouring his promise, indeed his cast-iron guarantee, of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. He reneged on that promise after the Labour Government had ratified the Treaty. But treaties are ratified by acts of parliament, and any act can be repealed. If he had wanted to, he could have repealed the ratification act and then submitted Lisbon to a referendum of the people. Instead he betrayed his promise and his guarantee turned out to be worthless. Now the government tells us not to worry anyway, because it makes no difference. But this is not true either. Britain could not opt out of or reform the Convention even if it wanted to, because we are bound by the Treaty of Lisbon. As usual the Tories betrayed Britain. Now they are in denial about the consequences of that betrayal. They had a solution and they did not use it. Now the only solution is the one advocated by the UK Independence Party, which is for Britain to leave the European Union.

Madam President, I have never advocated that Britain should leave the United Nations, which is a properly-constituted international body.

So I think I and my party have been entirely consistent in that. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 We come from completely opposite views on this and I do not think we are ever going to agree, but I have come across a curious anomaly which I would like your view on. The European Convention on Human Rights has been used by people like Abu Hamza and terrorist suspects to prevent their extradition to countries like America on the basis that their human rights might be abused. But I have sat in courts dealing with European Arrest Warrant cases, and one in particular where the European Convention was invoked because it was almost certain that, in being extradited to Greece, suspects would be held in the Korydallos Prison, where it was 100% guaranteed that their human rights were going to be violated. But the government prosecutor put the point that since Greece was a signatory of the Convention on Human Rights it could not be deemed to be in breach of it. The appeal court agreed and the suspects were extradited. Is it not odd that foreign countries are covered by the European Convention on Human Rights but it does not seem to apply in European countries and does not offer the protection that we would give to people being extradited to the USA? Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, the harmonisation of EU social security systems does not, of course, mean the harmonisation of the benefit systems themselves – that would be unachievable – but rather the harmonisation of access to those systems by all EU citizens. What this means is that many social security claimants will gravitate to those states with the most generous systems. In Britain, nearly five million people are on the council house waiting list, with little prospect of getting a home, but in some London boroughs, almost 50% of social housing is given to people not born in the UK. Many of these people will never have paid a penny in tax and will be living on state benefits. Of course there is no point in homeless Londoners emigrating to other EU Member States to seek homes and income on their social security systems because the benefits will not be as reciprocal. No one should gain public housing or benefits in Britain until they have paid tax for a considerable period of time. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, jobs which could easily be saved are being lost in London because of EU legislation. The Tate and Lyle sugar refinery in the borough of Newham has been forced to cut back on production and lay off 30 staff. This is because, under EU quota rules, they cannot buy the raw sugar they need within the EU. However, the Commission has the power to change the rules and allow Tate and Lyle to buy what they need on the world market. I wrote to Commissioner Cioloş on 14 March, asking him to urgently meet with Tate and Lyle so they could put their case for resolving the problem. So far, I have not had a reply. We cannot afford to lose these jobs in one of the poorest parts of London. I urge Commissioner Cioloş to meet with Tate and Lyle as soon as possible in order to reach a solution. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, I know that Mr Helmer is something of an expert on this subject, and wonder whether he can confirm or deny something that I have read in the press, which is that if Britain closed down all of its industry, took every British aeroplane out of the sky and every British car off the road, this would not actually make any discernible difference to the world output of CO2

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution.

For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, this regulation is the thin end of yet another wedge. The danger is that it will lead to an EU law of property ownership. An EU certificate of succession is a short step away from a European probate registry and the introduction of an EU property tax. Now, I doubt that many people in England realise that we are debating the EU’s intention to take control of inheritance law. The one good thing I can say about this is that the British Government has exercised its opt-out. It has not done that out of any principle – it does not have any any principles where the EU is concerned and there is only so much that you can get past the British public at any one time. What amazes me is not that they have opted out but that there was ever any serious intention of opting in. I was going to address myself to the MEPs here but as there are so few of them it is quite a redundant statement this evening. Anyway, some MEPs might like to consider the wisdom of handing yet more control to the EU in this area and vote with MEPs from the UK Independence Party against it. Gerard Batten  (EFD

I am reliably informed that this is the first time this appears to have happened in the experience of our assistants in five years of preparing voting lists. Not all Members may be aware of its existence, and I wish to draw your attention to it. If you vote for this, then the whole of the rest of the motion falls.

Madam President, I have had hundreds of e-mails from my constituents on the subject of ACTA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. ACTA intends to take alleged infringements of copyright, patents and trademarking from the jurisdiction of civil law to criminal law. Intellectual property rights have to be protected but ACTA, like so much legislation that comes from this place, favours the interest of big business over small business and individuals. If this comes under criminal law, the great danger is that alleged transgressors could be extradited on European arrest warrants to the four corners of the European Union to face months or years in prison. I and my colleagues in the UK Independence Party are once again the voice of the people in this place. UK Independence Party MEPs oppose ACTA and we will vote against it when the time comes. We urge all MEPs to do the same. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, the BBC is currently broadcasting a series entitled ‘Putin, Russia and the West’. In the second programme, Tony Blair’s former aide Jonathan Powell recounts the famous ‘spy rock’ scandal story. The Kremlin had accused MI6 of funding Russian human rights groups and other NGOs and using a fake rock located in a Moscow square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents. Mr Powell confirmed this story (whether it is true or not), and the BBC elevated it to the status of a scoop by issuing a press release. The FSB reacted promptly, publicly accusing two leading NGOs – Memorial and Golos – of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by the West. Both organisations are now under systematic harassment by the authorities. Powell’s claim is either untrue or illegal under the Official Secrets Act. The BBC is guilty of gross journalistic irresponsibility, and this shows once again that Putin’s is a gangster regime. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, this directive calls for common rights for third-party migrants working in the EU. If adopted it would remove what little rights remain or are still left to Member States to determine their own immigration policy. It wants third-party migrants to enjoy comparable rights to those of EU nationals, including working conditions, social security and access to public services. But of course not all Member States have the same level of social security and public services, and of course a citizen of a state, by definition, enjoys the benefits of that citizenship, or should enjoy the benefits of that citizenship that non-citizens do not. If citizens do not have exclusive rights, then the concept of citizenship itself is meaningless. What this will mean is that third-party migrants will flood to those states that have the highest levels of public housing, social security and public services. No prizes for guessing that Britain will be top of their list as a destination. Equally unsurprisingly, I can tell you that UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this directive.

Blue-card answer

 I know that may be technically true, but we seem to get saddled with these directives in time anyway. I am sure that we will not be able to wriggle out of it for very long, in the same way as we get all kinds of people turning up in our country and taking benefits in the social security and housing system, although they have got no rights to them. We know that for a fact. So while I hope that you are right and there will be a way of avoiding this, I think that in practice we will not. Gerard Batten,

 Mr President, this directive includes the right to information for persons facing a European arrest warrant. In the case of an EAW, it will have to be a short letter. Subjects of EAWs effectively have no meaningful rights. Provided that the form has been correctly completed, the court has no power to refuse extradition. The court cannot base its decision on the prima facie evidence – or the lack of it – against the accused person. What is worse is that some people are being extradited, not after being charged, but to face investigation. One of my constituents in London, Dr Miguel-Ángel Meizoso, is facing extradition to Spain, not for something that he is alleged to have done, but for something he is accused of that he might possibly do in the future. If you do not believe me, I can give you the case papers. An English court would reject his extradition if it had any power to do so. Giving Dr Meizoso a nice letter will not protect him and will be small consolation. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Mr President, I would like to address Mr Barroso. You always tell the same story which is more of the same: more Europe, not less Europe. Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity was to keep on doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. You propose yet more swathes of legislation and yet more power to the EU. You have previously said that the EU must assume economic and financial fiscal governance of the Member States. Where has all this centralisation of power actually got you? The EU underperforms economically with the rest of the world, mainly because of the burden of job-destroying and prosperity-restricting legislation. The crises in Greece and Italy have been, in part, caused by their membership of the European single currency. Instead of organising an orderly exit, they have had to sacrifice democratic government and have it replaced by rule by economists and technocrats. You propose yet more of the same thing and expect different results. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to predict the result. Gerard Batten,

– Madam President, the European Union is becoming increasingly unpopular with citizens across the continent. It is rightly seen as out of touch, undemocratic and dictatorial. The euro, its grand unifying political project, is collapsing round its ears. Greece and Italy are the first to pay the price by having undemocratic government imposed on them. So what does the Commission do to halt this decline in popularity? It comes up with vain and crass projects in an effort to make itself appear more relevant to Member States. First, it attempted to place the EU flag – which is not meant to exist anyway – on the sports kits of national teams. Then it calls for the EU flag to be flown at sporting events, and now it comes up with the crackpot idea of EU heritage labels. In the report, it says that these EU heritage sites would be monuments, cultural landscapes, archaeological sites, and even places of remembrance. What an insult! Are you really suggesting that war memorials which honour the brave and fallen in two World Wars should have an EU plaque placed on them? There is only one memorial in England I can think of where it would be appropriate to stick an EU plaque, and that is the gravestone of Ted Heath, the man who betrayed Britain into the European Union. I do not think anyone would object to that, least of all him. The report also says that the plaque’s aim is to strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU. It will not: it will just enrage the natives. It is just desperate propaganda from an organisation to which more and more people do not wish to belong. I urge all MEPs who are proud of the heritage of their own nations to vote for my group’s rejection amendment tomorrow. Let us stick the European Heritage Label on the dustbin of history. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Madam President, this own-initiative report on the Professional Qualifications Directive is another piece of ideologically-driven harmonisation. It calls for minimum training requirements, automatic recognition and the removing of formal obstacles to recognition of professional qualifications. It goes on to say that ‘only if necessary should language tests be part of the recognition process and cannot be an additional border to mobility’. Most normal people would want professional qualifications, especially medical qualifications, to be subject to maximum, not minimum, standards – and not speaking the language properly should very much be a bar to practising and mobility. There is a case that clearly demonstrates the dangers. In 2008, a German-qualified doctor, Dr Daniel Ubani, was convicted in England of gross negligence and manslaughter after he over prescribed drugs to a patient. This directive means we cannot discriminate against EU professionals, while we must discriminate against properly-qualified fluent English speakers from the Commonwealth. This is another good reason, if we needed one, why Britain should leave the European Union. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in recent months, England has seen a series of despicable crimes: memorial plaques recording the names of the heroic dead of two world wars are being systematically stolen for their scrap metal value. Decent English people wonder how these revered monuments which have stood safely in cities, towns and villages for generations have become the targets for thieves. Today’s Daily Express
 reports that the police believe that these crimes are predominantly carried out by Romanian gangs. The EU’s open door policy is directly to blame; we do not just get the decent, honest, hard-working migrants that we might choose. We are forced to take the lowest forms of criminal life merely because they are EU citizens. Membership of the EU is destroying my country. What more revolting proof of that could there be than the melting down for scrap of the monuments to those who gave their lives so we could be free. Gerard Batten  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, demographics, of course, is a fascinating subject, and behind great historical developments and changes there is often an untold demographic story. Britain is now undergoing a massive population explosion which, until very recently, went unreported. When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997, we had a population of just over 58 million. That population has now grown to over 62.4 million and, on current trends, the population will grow to over 70 million by 2030 and thereafter spiral ever upwards. Demographers calculate that all this unsustainable population growth is down to migration and births to migrants. There is nothing wrong with some appropriate, moderate and sustainable immigration, but the UK is adding over one million people to its net population every four to five years. England is more densely populated than India, China and Japan. Britain does not have a cohesion policy, but if it did, it would leave the European Union and regain control of its borders and its immigration policy. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 Mr President, and thank you, Mr Bisky, you mention in your speech that anti-Europe sentiment and feeling was gaining ground. Can I ask you to accept that there is a clear distinction between anti-European Union feeling and anti-Europe? The people who are anti the European Union of the political construction, like me, are very pro-Europe. Would you please accept that there is a clear distinction there and we should stop talking about anti-European sentiment and start talking about anti-European Union sentiment? Gerard Batten  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the so-called ‘six pack’ imposes economic rule on the Member States via the European Union. The English Parliament established in the reign of King Edward I that its key reason for existing was control of the public finances. In 1642 the English fought a Civil War and then cut off a King’s head precisely in order to establish its sole right to levy taxes. Now, not by means of an Act of Parliament, but by means of a regulation from the European Union, the British Government is expected to meekly accept financial control by the European Union. If it does, there can no longer be any pretence that Britain is a sovereign nation or a democracy. The British Government should reject and repudiate these regulations and defend the rights of Parliament. To do otherwise is abject surrender. Gerard Batten  (EFD

 The architects of the European Single Currency are to blame for the crisis that now faces the eurozone. The euro was never an economic project. It was a political project designed to help bring about a United States of Europe. Once of the vital attributes of a state is its currency and that is why the European Union forced through the introduction of the euro against all the sensible advice against it. You do not have to be an economist to know that to constrain a number of completely different economies within a single interest rate and exchange rate will, over time, bring nothing but problems and eventual disaster. That is what we are seeing now, and of course Mr Barroso is calling for full economic and financial governance of the eurozone countries by the European Union. The crisis was entirely predictable and so was Mr Barroso’s proposed solution. The euro is going to come apart. It is just a question of time. The longer it takes the worse the crash is going to be. The people to blame are those who forced the economies of the eurozone into an economic straightjacket in order to serve a political dogma. Gerard Batten,

– Madam President, there is indeed a massive problem with illegal immigration into Europe. The effects of this problem are especially felt in England and, in particular, in my constituency of London. England attracts immigration – illegal and legal – because of the possibilities for work and our generous benefits and housing systems. The UK Independence Party would not be opposed to genuine cooperation between European nation states to counter the problems of illegal immigration – but this proposal is not about genuine cooperation. It seeks to change the legal basis on which Frontex operates and gives it more so-called competences. It will, for example, give Frontex the ability to cooperate with third-party countries on behalf of the EU. This proposal is yet another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. The proposal is another step in introducing the European Union’s common immigration and asylum policy as enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. As I will never tire of saying, the Lisbon Treaty was undemocratically imposed on the peoples of Europe without their consent. The Lisbon Treaty was illegal under existing English constitutional law, and everything that stems from it is therefore illegal in England. There is another problem here, which is the European Convention on Human Rights. British courts are obligated to protect the human rights of foreign nationals in the UK. Once in the UK, they only have to claim that their human rights are likely to be at risk in their own country and the courts will not send them home. As a result of this, we have given refuge to all kinds of criminals. If I heard him correctly, Mr Busuttil said that all operations would be suspended while a human rights issue was being considered. This is like baling out a boat with a bucket that has an enormous hole in the bottom. The UK Independence Party will vote against this proposal. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Frontex report because it is nation states and not EU agencies which should control and patrol national borders. Frontex is an affront to British freedom. This latest move is simply a power grab by the EU to give Frontex more money, personnel, equipment and powers. This vote gives the wrong powers to the wrong people. This proposal is another way of increasing the power and dominion of the European Union over its Member States. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– I voted against the Galileo programme as an expensive, useless and void EU project which alleges to replace the GPS system and, for example, enhance border security, but, in fact, is an ambitious project which merely seeks to promote the EU brand globally. Taxpayers’ money must be spent on more reasonable projects than sending into space EU-labelled satellites in order to compete with the USA. The purpose of Galileo is to further the EU’s plans for one military force to which I am totally opposed. Gerard Batten  (EFD

in writing. 
– I voted against this report as it reflects yet another example of an EU attempt to grab sovereign prerogatives of the nations in the region of the South Pacific. The EU is usurping the right to decide on matters which should remain in the hands of poor communities perfectly capable of managing their fishing and maritime preservation. Poorer nations from the South Pacific should keep the right to use their fishery resources freely to retain their independence and avoid the risk of massive emigration. Gerard Batten  (EFD

– Women over 50 are a great asset to society. We do not need the EU to interfere in our national life to enable these ladies to make the most of their potential and abilities.

Mr President, I am minded to quote the great American philosopher Murray Rothbard here, that the state is an institution of theft writ large. Tax is just about a system where politicians and bureaucrats steal money from their citizens, to squander in the most disgraceful manner. This place is no exception. Fascinatingly – and I really do not know how they manage to keep a straight face when they are talking about tax evasion – the whole Commission and the Commission bureaucracy avoid their taxes. They do not pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. They have all sorts of special deals – composite tax rates, high tax thresholds, non-contributory pension schemes. They are the biggest tax avoiders in Europe and here they sit pontificating. Well, I would point out to the Commission that the message is getting home to the people of the European Union. You are going to find that Eurosceptics are coming back in June in ever greater numbers. And I can tell you worse: as the people get your number, it will not be long before they storm this Chamber and they hang you, and they will be right. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Mr President, not for the first time I rise to give the House the benefit of my 35 years’ experience in financial services – rather more, I suspect, than the rest of you put together. Let me put you right on how this all started. It started with something called the Community Reinvestment Act in the USA, and the reason the whole thing has gone wrong is political interference. We have been talking today, have we not, about due diligence in banking? Well, the Community Reinvestment Act actually stopped banks carrying out due diligence checks. It became illegal to inquire of a borrower whether he could or could not repay the loan, and that is when you saw the invention of subprime mortgages, which had never existed before. It was political interference in the market which caused the subprime crisis. Add to that the bubble in the property market created by criminal, fraudulent central bankers printing money and artificially restraining interest rates, as central banks are still doing now. The US Federal Reserve is still doing it, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England: they are all at it, counterfeiting money. So we are lending money now at far too cheap a rate. We just print more money, and we are going to have another bubble and we are going to do the whole thing all over again! Allow me to close with one point which you clearly do not understand: if it is impossible to foreclose on a mortgage, nobody will give you a mortgage. That is how the market works. Leave it to the market, caveat emptor, and let people get on with it without interference from politicians who, frankly, do not know what they are talking about. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Mr President, I wonder if you will permit me to gallop through the working day of the average Englishman. He wakes up and turns on his taxed television to get the news; he leaves his heavily taxed house; gets in his heavily taxed car; he fills it with heavily taxed diesel. He then gets to work to earn an income which, after income tax, employer and employee national insurance, is reduced by a third. He drives home and stops on the high street for a few articles for the house. His purchases are taxed at 20%. He calls in for a pint, over two-thirds of the cost of which goes in tax. He dreams of a family holiday abroad, but he cannot afford the airport tax. He longs for the day that he can retire, but the politicians will not let him go.  We must steal his savings, must we not, through the financial transaction tax? The poor sap does not even know we have nicked it. Of course, with the Commission’s top income-tax-free salaries and non-contributory pension schemes, it is difficult for you to imagine his distress, is it not? You are not in this game, are you? You do not pay any of this. You do not pay any of this. On a more technical note, I draw the House's attention to my own lunatic committee’s Amendment 39 to Article 4a on the withdrawal of legal title to untaxed transactions anywhere in the world. This is sugar in the petrol tank, if you will. We are very much looking forward to the vote. We are watching to see which imbeciles commend it. I suspect it will be usual parliamentarian flat-earthers. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Madam President, as a matter of fact, I am not without some sympathy with the Council on this because you are trying to do the impossible. I think Parliament is trying to make you do the impossible.  The long and short of it is – as well known in Austrian economics – that, in order to regulate financial services, you would need perfect knowledge of the market. That is impossible and cannot be done. It is sometimes know as the fatal conceit. What we need to go back to is liberty of contract so that the individual, the investor, can contract under law in a property-owning democracy with whomsoever banker or investment manager he wants, without the interference of the state and the implicit guarantee of the taxpayer that goes with it. Central bankers and retail bankers hide behind regulation. They are not dominated or guided by regulation. It is what keeps these people out of prison when they cheat the general public. You are part of the conspiracy. For goodness sake, move away from prescriptive regulation and let the law of the land take its course. Godfrey Bloom,

Mr President, my sincere apologies for not being on parade. It is quite unlike me. I do apologise for it and thank you for your courtesy. Interesting, is it not, that one of the great political questions in the United Kingdom when it comes to discussion of the euro is: cock-up or conspiracy. Is it a cock-up or is it a conspiracy? We are still arguing about that in the pubs of England. We are not quite sure. It must be completely obvious to anybody with even the remotest bit of economic understanding that this common currency was doomed to failure from the outset if it was not accompanied by fiscal policy. It must have fiscal policy to have one currency and one interest rate. It comes with the package. It must be part of the same phenomenon. The conspiracies theorists say, ah: they knew that this would happen, that this would collapse and that this would bring grief to many countries unfortunate enough and stupid enough to be part of this common currency, and what will happen is, when it collapses – when it catches fire, when it all goes wrong – they can then (‘they’ being the conspirators) push through an undemocratic system of government on people, whether they like it or not. I think this is the first part of it. This is what we are looking at with this document. It is the first bit of an undemocratic procedure so we can cut ordinary voters – members of the electorate – out of the system.

. – 
It depends on your perspective really, does it not? I would argue that there is no remit for a common fiscal policy. It has not been put to the people, either in a referendum or in any political way that I can see – certainly not in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, as you know, we have been promised but denied in reality a referendum for many years. I can only speak for the United Kingdom, but I would argue that there is no democratic remit for this and therefore you cannot push a common fiscal policy through. If you ask the people on the streets of Rome or Madrid, or Lisbon or Athens, I think you will get your answer. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Madam President, I find it interesting when I listen to these debates. The House always seems to imagine that there is some huge tree with money on it and you just pick the money off. Well, we have heard all about poverty, we have heard all about unemployment – all of it is true. Perhaps you will bear with me while I explain why. We have a crazy system of both corporate and social welfare. It is a failed post-war experiment. We have a system in the United Kingdom where we pay perfectly fit, healthy young men and women not to work. We import people from Eastern Europe to do that work. So we are pouring money into a complete dead-end of our economy and, in order to pay for it, we have to have things like 20% VAT, monstrous income tax and monstrous national insurance, which actually hamstring the economy from recovering. The only way out of this terrible mess is growth, and we do just about everything we can possibly do here to stop the economy growing. If it is not social welfare, it is corporate welfare. We have a sort of crony capitalism. We do not have real capitalism; it is crony capitalism. I have got landowning friends in Yorkshire, with 1 000 acres of mixed, who get GBP 100 000 a year and a single farm payment. They shove a couple of windmills on it and they are getting GBP 200 000 a year before they get out of bed. Of course people are in food poverty with this crazy system. For goodness sake, get rid of regulation, get rid of tax and free the thing up from this stranglehold, this cancer in society of welfare and get our young people back to work. Godfrey Bloom,

. –  
Madam President, Commissioner, I rise again, I am afraid, to make the same old hoary speech that I have been making here for several years. That is: it is my opinion that you do not really understand the concept of banking. All the banks are broke. Bank Santander, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland: they are all broke. And why are they broke? It is not an act of God; it is not some sort of tsunami. They are broke because we have a system called fractional reserve banking, which means that banks can lend money that they do not actually have. It is a criminal scandal and it has been going on for too long. To add to that problem you have moral hazard – a very significant moral hazard – from the political sphere, and most of the problems start in politics and central banks, which are part of the same political system. We have counterfeiting, sometimes called quantitative easing, but counterfeiting  by any other name – the artificial printing of money for which, if any ordinary person did it,  they would be sent to prison for a very long time. Yet governments and central banks do it all the time. Central banks repress the amount of interest rates so we do not have the real cost of money, and yet we blame the retail banks for manipulating the LIBOR rate. The sheer effrontery of this is quite astonishing. It is central banks that manipulate interest rates, Commissioner. Plus, underneath all this, we talk loosely – in a rather cavalier fashion, do we not – about deposit guarantees. So when banks go broke through their own incompetence and chicanery, the taxpayer picks up the tab. It is theft from the taxpayer. Until we start sending bankers – and I include central bankers and politicians – to prison for this outrage, it will continue. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, what we are dealing with here is a triumph of hope over experience. We are talking about things which are not the problem; the problem which we have is a flawed banking system – a fractional reserve banking system where bankers can lend money that they do not have. If you go back in time to the United States in the 1850s, that was a capital offence. You could hang for it. We have this extraordinary situation where we have had regulation – lots of regulation – which has been the wrong sort of regulation, has it not? And so we have had another disaster. None of this is actually going to save us from another disaster further down the line. It is bound to happen, because we have not addressed the real problems, and that is the EU’s fractional reserve banking system. We must have a commodity bank on the one hand and an investment bank on the other. So, Commissioner, you talk about the banks’ ability to withstand shocks. Well, by that definition – by your definition – a shock is people turning up wanting their money back. That is not a shock; that should be a day-to-day occurrence and should be dealt with accordingly. We are talking about bankers’ bonuses, which is an absolutely wonderful way of taking everybody’s eye off the ball. What we have actually had here is criminal activity by banks – and not a single banker has been sent to prison. That is extraordinary: billions of pounds have been taken away from taxpayers, taken away from depositors and bondholders, and yet not a single banker is in jail. That is a disgrace! We really have to use the law of the land, not so much regulation and printing money – and central banks are equally culpable, make no mistake. I would like to see some central bankers in prison. I call ‘quantitative easing’ counterfeiting. Printing money is counterfeiting. It is illegal; if a private citizen did it, they would go to jail. So let us look into our own hearts. All the very unpleasant arrangements that politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers have between them at the expense of the taxpayer, let us end them and let us end them now. Godfrey Bloom,

Madam President, Commissioner. You know, Mr Draghi, that I am always impressed by your totally non-compromising support for the euro, doomed though we all now know it to be. It appeals to this certain Englishman – there is a sort of Shakespearian quality, I have to say: Lear-like. It puts me in mind of his great speech: ‘I will do such things, – What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be the Terrors of the earth’. Can I make a plea for my friends and their families in Cyprus? A micro-brewer who had his savings in a bank to start a micro-brewing company – not a rich man at all, but of course it was more than EUR 100 000, because it was his life savings. A retired British army officer whose life savings have now all but disappeared in the great Cypriot bank heist. Of course the big boys got their money out early, didn’t they? It is always the little people who get shafted, isn’t it? I am not totally convinced that you really care about them. Can you give me an assurance that you will do whatever it takes to get these poor people’s money back? We now have a situation which the previous speaker, Mr Eppink, alluded to quite rightly: the FED, the Bank of England, the ECB and the Bank of Japan are all completely bankrupt, and they are holding mountains of junk bonds bought with counterfeit money. Let us all blame the retail banks – but it is the central banks where the cancer starts. Politicians, bankers and lackey bureaucrats should be arraigned at an international financial tribunal in The Hague in the same way as war criminals.

 Let me assure you that United Kingdom politicians and central bankers are no less stupid than the people out here or the people in Washington. Believe me, they disgust me just as much.

 Mr President, well what do we know about carbon dioxide? Not carbon – carbon dioxide is a different thing for those people in this Chamber who have not had the benefit of a formal education. They are different things. We know that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere always follows periods of global warming. We know, do we not, that the hypothesis that man-made global warming was going to cause totally apocryphal boiling in 2050 now is completely nonsense. The hypothesis is dead in the water. It is facedown. There has been no statistically significant global warming now for over fifteen years. There is not a single independent scientific institution which does not acknowledge that fact. So all this debate is a lot of nonsense, because it simply is not happening. And Commissioner, you say that the weather is getting worse and worse; that climate change is getting worse. Madam, where have you been? It has not been. Why are you in denial? You are in denial! If I may lapse into the vernacular of the loony Greenies and their fellow travellers on this complete money-making nonsense: denier! Denier!

Mr President, let us look at VAT, shall we? What is it really? Well, of course it is a tax, so it is just a form of extortion by the State confiscating money from ordinary working people for the State to spend on itself. It is bureaucracy, politicians, subsidies for cronies and donors to party funds. The tax is regressive and monstrous – 20 % in the United Kingdom. It is inflationary, obviously, with 20 % on all goods. It is closing down retailers in the high street. Manufacturers are on three-day weeks. In the UK manufacturing has fallen 35 % in the last few years.  And what a silly tax it is. It is paid and reclaimed throughout the life of a transaction. It is not applied when value is added, whatever that may mean, but at the end so the customer pays it or simply withdraws his custom. So you get a recession. Notwithstanding the draconian powers given to VAT collectors, worthy of the old East German secret police – and I know some of you want to bring that back – fraud is rife. As criminals are always more clever than politicians – hey, what is the difference? – fraud will remain. If you really want to get rid of fraud, get rid of the tax. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

 Thank you for taking the question. I just thought that as we are talking about waking up and we are talking about climate change, I would draw it to your attention – you keep missing the point I think – that there is no scientific institution now in the world which does not accept that there has been no significance statistical climate change since 1995. I am just wondering when you are going actually to wake up to that fact? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Madam President, I get the impression that Members think that if they use the word ‘growth’ enough, it will somehow magically manifest itself. The reason that growth is unacceptably low is actually quite simple, as anybody from the Pacific Rim could tell us. The reason it is low is that we are overtaxed, overregulated and over-governed. Most Members of this House and the Commission have never had a job in the commercial sector. This is an Achilles’ heel of gargantuan proportions. We have a suicidal energy policy. Employment legislation makes it impossible to employ anybody, especially small businesses and particularly young people. There will be no economic growth until we can close down this place, and the Commission. This is part of the problem. We are the problem and not the solution. Yet perhaps it will close itself down. Perhaps, and maybe sooner than we think. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Mr President, we are very interested to see how people vote on what is a very important subject. I draw your attention to Rule 161(5). A little transparency, even in this place, would not go amiss. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – 
Mr President, this is a very complicated subject. Of course the credit rating agencies were not blameless in the subprime crisis, nor in the credit crunch that followed. Lord knows I have castigated them in this Chamber enough, but since 2008 they have improved. They have been honest with the markets about the worthless government debt of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, if not yet the United Kingdom and the United States.  But are we to crush the rating agencies with regulation?  Recall how they rate government debt: you require the rating agencies to get the prior approval of the regulator, ESMA, for their methodologies so that you can manipulate the calculations behind the scenes. Then, in order to control when they publicise their work, you force the rating agencies to disclose to ESMA the dates on which they are going to provide ratings on government debt and to limit those dates to three times a year. This is so that you will not suffer the embarrassment of a downgrade or negative outlook just before a critical auction of government paper. Then, to control where the rating agencies work, you insist that some of the work is done in the jurisdiction of government debt so that you can intimidate the analysts in the same way that the offices of credit rating agencies have been raided by government bodies in places such as Italy. Then, to control who does the work, you insist not only on the rotation of credit rating agencies themselves, but also on the individual analysts who work and have experience on particular debt and the assets that back them. Finally, to control the purpose of providing credit ratings, you seek to remove references to and reliance upon ratings, both within the workings of government and in private investment funds. Much of this is actually an attack on free speech. The world is watching you, frankly. Can you be trusted? I believe that this is a regulation to castrate the rating agencies and turn them into government eunuchs to vainly protect the chastity of the euro, a currency born out of wedlock and without a dowry. I fear that we will find ourselves back exactly in the position where we started. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

Mr President, I rise somewhat wearily to explain yet again the banking crisis to this House. Banks lend long, but borrow short. Central banks encourage malpractice by printing money – counterfeiting by any other name. Politicians use this fake money to prop up corporate and social welfare, basically bribing people with their own money. Financial regulation has become a shield to protect crooked bankers, while politicians, central and commercial banks spend money they do not have. The problem will simply fester. So what of banking union? Will national parliaments have any say? I take this opportunity to ask, as there are British Conservative colleagues in the House tonight, will Cameron stop this? Will he invoke Article 127 of the TEU or will he, as form suggests, sit like a paralysed rabbit in the EU’s headlights? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, a financial transaction tax sounds like a very good idea, does it not? It plays well politically, and we can hit those greedy bankers, whom we all hate in public while we shovel money into their pockets in private. However, I do not think it is quite going to work out that way. All taxes are passed on to customers at the end of the day – sorry everybody, but that is just how it works – so again it will be the little people who pick up the tab. It will be savers, it will be pensioners and it will be ordinary folk who pick up the tab for this tax, not the greedy fat-cat bankers that you are trying to get at. It is interesting, when you look at the small print, to see they are saying that some of the money raised can perhaps go towards saving future failed banks. So we know – we concede, do we not? – that more banks are going to fail. We know this because we have the same ridiculous, fractional-reserve banking system, the same crooked, money-printing, criminal behaviour at the central banks, and so on and so forth. So nothing has changed. This is another strong signal to bankers and politicians to continue the theft. But beware those who think that taxing London is a risk-free game – and we mean London don’t we? When it comes to financial services, other EU countries are Mickey Mouse. Financial services account for 14% of UK GDP, and the UK contributes GBP 50 million pounds a day to this crumbling institution. Do not kill the goose that lays your golden eggs! Zurich, Geneva, New York and Hong Kong are licking their lips wondering what piece of glorious stupidity we will come up with next. An FTT is a special tax, so what next? A special tax on sunshine holidays in Spain; high fashion in Paris; luxury cars in Germany; mobile phones in Finland; and perhaps a justifiably special tax on dreadful flat-pack furniture from Sweden? It is coming to your street next! The greedy bureaucrats just want your money. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take two blue-card questions under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

Blue-card answer. 
– How dare you! You – the British Conservative Party – transferred the regulation of the City of London to this place, and you fiddle about in your silly little committees having betrayed my country. You scoundrel! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
),  
Blue-card answer. 
– Mr Maňka, no, the problem we have is fractional-reserve banking, which means that banks lend money that they do not have, and that central banks and politicians print money, degrading currency. That is your problem. It is not regulation, it is not taxation. It is because of criminal behaviour, frankly, at the world’s central banks. Until that stops, nothing is going to change. There are a lot more bank failures coming down the road, believe me. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, harmonised taxation is simply a ploy to enable bureaucrats to steal even more money from the wealth-creating sector. Like vampires, they prey upon ordinary folk, sucking the lifeblood out of the economy – and for what? Tax-free salaries, non-contributive pension schemes, winter sunshine trips to Durban and Cancún, suicidal remote energy policies and constant rescue packages for failed banks. Without tax competition, Europe would be bled white in pursuit of a maniacal political crusade. High tax would banish manufacturing to the Far East, the Indian subcontinent and North America. The Baltic States, Ireland and fellow entrepreneurial ex-Warsaw Pact countries would slip back into the abyss. Athens and Madrid would become Dublin and Warsaw, but I suspect that before that time, ordinary folk will have cried enough and the parasites will have to head for the hills, as well they may. For certain the Irish, I suspect, will have their own way of dealing with them when they eventually awake from their slumber. Godfrey Bloom,

 Mr President, in the 1970s the Community Reinvestment Act in the United States made due diligence in banking illegal. To pursue a political goal, the Administration laid open the pathway to what we now know as sub-prime debt. It proved to be – as I said it would at the time – a pathway to hell paved with good intentions. It was conceived to make banks lend to people who could not possibly repay. We politicians now love to blame the banks, but it started with politics. Sadly, politicians do not understand money. How else could we have got ourselves into this appalling mess? Yet we have learnt nothing; we are now advocating a form of Eurobond, a sub-prime debt instrument by any other name. Again, we are bailing out the banks at the expense of the taxpayer. The ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed are all at it: print money; give it to the banks to buy junk bonds – bogusly rated as double A – to shore up their reserves and guarantee salaries and bonuses that ordinary people can only wonder at. We have learnt nothing from the 2008 crisis. We are desperately clinging to a failed political ideal as our cities riot and burn. The day must surely come when politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers must be called to account by a fiscal crimes tribunal and sent to prison for a very long time. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
),  
Blue-card question. 
– 
Mr President, as a supporter and sponsor of Cambridge University’s Ladies’ Rugby Club for, I guess, 15 to 20 years, I wonder whether they should wear the logo on the front of their shirts or on the back? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I hope I may call you ‘shipmate’ in private! I would like to welcome the President of the Bank and to thank him for turning up, even if nobody else has. I have read this report, unlike most of my colleagues probably: power to suspend credit ratings, a European Monetary Fund to exclude the IMF, a single European Treasury issuing eurobonds and a single European Finance Minister, all of which, of course, would be unelected. It is a manifesto for European economic dictatorship, which is why I rather suspect the British Conservative Party will welcome it with open arms. If they do not vote for it, they will abstain in a marked manner, as they usually do, and talk a good story back in London. The President of the Bank reminds me a little bit of the poem by Siegfried Sassoon, the great war poet: ‘He’s a cheery old card’ said Harry to Jack, ‘As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack, But he did for them both with his plan of attack’. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, Ms Gáll-Pelcz mentioned the purchase of risky assets and I am a little bit confused. I am a professional economist. With whose money would you buy these risky assets? With whose money? Where would you get the money? Is it from old age pensioners in Yorkshire – my constituency – on GBP 100 per week? Where are you going to get the money to save this already failed project? Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I certainly do not want it to fail but there is a feeling in the House that we have been hit by an asteroid or a tsunami, that this is not a problem of our own making. The reason the country and the European Union is in a shambles over the euro is of our own making: we have brought this upon ourselves. It is not an act of God. When will this House wake up to the fact we have done it to ourselves? Wake up, I beg you! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, one thing we do know about climate is that it is a pretty odd old thing. We know that it was warmer on the globe in the Holocene period; we know it was warmer in the Roman period; we also know it was warmer in the medieval period. It was cooler in the Little Ice Age in the early 19th century. We also know there has been no significant change in climate over the last 6 000 years and we also know that most scientific organisations have confirmed that there has been no significant statistical global warming in the last 15 years? I have these figures in front of me. They are the same figures that Mr Davies quoted. He is very careful in what he selects. What I would like to suggest before everybody disappears to Durban, saving the world as they travel on first class airfares and sip their martinis in expensive hotels, is that I have old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week … and you are picking up the tab. I would suggest, given this fiscal crisis that we have, that it would be a nice gesture – particularly from you, Commissioner, who does not pay much income tax and is on a very good salary – for you to offer to pay for your own trip. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, it is a shame that the Commissioner has gone. He would learn so much from me, since, unlike most of the people here, I actually have commercial experience. I have actually run companies. I actually know what I am talking about. I am going to talk about jobs now. We have 40% youth unemployment in parts of the European Union, and it is being suggested by people here that this is some sort of act of God. It is not an act of God: it is sheer, unadulterated incompetence. Look at what the EU is doing. Look at the barriers it is putting in front of companies, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, preventing them from employing people. We have minimum wages. We have pensions. We have holiday entitlements. We have a job tax – called national insurance in my country – which is absolutely huge, so the employee does not actually get half the money that is being paid by the employer. Trying to get rid of lazy and incompetent workers is virtually impossible, so sacking people is very difficult. And if you cannot hire, you cannot fire, so you lose flexibility. We have maternity leave, paternity leave, stress leave and all the rest of the nonsense that is invented by people here who have absolutely no commercial experience at all. It is not an accident that we have 40% of our young people unemployed: it is your fault. And let me remind you of liberty of contract. In a free society, we should have liberty of contract so that an employer and an employee can get together, sign a contract and get on with their lives without interference from this place. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, Mr Sturdy is an eminent businessman very close to where I live. He is one of the few exceptions and I apologise to him. (Laughter) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I rise with some humility as representing a country which managed to elect a Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, a Scotsman, the only Scotsman in the world who actually does not care how much money he spends: it is an interesting phenomenon! So as I say, I rise with some humility. However, I look forward with the great British sense of humour which is one thing nobody can take away from us in this place which gave us an energy policy, an employment policy, a fisheries policy, an agricultural policy that have been – as almost everything that this place has done has been – a complete and total disaster. We are now contemplating a response to disasters, most of which of course we create for ourselves in this place. So I can say I look forward to seeing how this develops, how it goes forward in the future, and I am just interested to see what kind of pig’s breakfast you are going to make of this one! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I am a baby boomer. I was born just after the war. From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally. I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on – largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned. I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard. It always seems to me to come as a complete surprise to politicians how countries get in debt. Let me explain, because I do not think you really understand. It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation – more money than they can possibly raise in taxation –, most of which, in point of fact, they actually waste. The reason we are talking about countries which are broke – and they are broke – is because their ridiculous, ineffective, ignorant politicians consistently spend more money than they can raise. Then they borrow, and they borrow, and – worse – they then print money, because politicians and their central banks have a machine which prints money. If you do that as a private citizen, it is a criminal offence. You would go to prison for that, yet politicians and their central banks do it all the time. Let me explain to you that these countries are broke. They are broke because of their own stupid leadership and politicians. It is immoral – immoral! – to ask ordinary taxpayers of any country to pick up the tab for failed politicians and failed banks. They have defaulted. They are broke. For God’s sake, let us all admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Absolutely right. I was not suggesting my politicians were any less stupid than anybody else. It is an absolute disgrace, and there was not even a debate in our national parliament on actually rescuing these bust banks. If you want to invest in bust banks, do so with your own money, not money from my old age pensioners in Yorkshire on GBP 98 a week, you scoundrels! Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I rise before the House today to mention one or two things which might perhaps be of help. I spent 35 years as an investment banker, investment manager, investment adviser and economic strategist, and I never bought a dud bank in my life. I never bought a dud bank for my clients, but over the past few years, I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head, as a taxpayer, and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at. These are not even British dud banks, they are foreign dud banks, and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal. If I want to invest overseas, I will buy an emerging markets fund. I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force. I say ‘Mickey Mouse bank’, Mr Maystadt, because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life. I do not know where you get your advice from, but statistically, the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years, so what are you going to shovel all this money into? I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people. I would counsel you, if you want to keep your AAA status, to ignore the pleas of this House – full of eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives – in particular, in relation to paragraph 48 of the report. Solar panels in the land of the wildebeest, giraffe and bongo drum will lose you your AAA rating in no time at all. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
–
 Mr President, I would like to go back to the matter of Libya if I may. When did the political class and the great and the good suddenly catch up with the fact that Colonel Gaddafi is an evil man? When, since that wonderful photograph with you embracing him, Mr President, did you suddenly come to realise that he was a “wrong’un”? I can tell you that the victims of Lockerbie in Scotland and the victims of IRA atrocities in my country knew very well what sort of scoundrel this man was. But he has got oil and he has got money so you all turned a blind eye, didn’t you? Well, the chickens have come home to roost. The most absurd figure in all this is the British Prime Minister, who stands there rattling his empty scabbard – having disestablished the Royal Navy, having disestablished the Royal Air Force – making threats from the sidelines, with no aircraft carriers, nothing, and calls himself a Conservative but is just a superannuated schoolboy whistling in the dark. We talk a great deal about violence against the people, we talk a lot about democracy. And yet we have had a homicidal baboon in Zimbabwe for years now, and we do not do anything about it, do we? We do not care because there is no money and there is no oil. That is so typical of this place: full of hypocrisy and humbug. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have been here six and a half years, and, my goodness, I have heard some nonsense. But I have not heard so much nonsense spoken as I have today. Many years ago, I used to lecture on this subject at Cambridge University, and I would suggest that you would do well to read some of my old lecture notes. None of you, it appears, seems to understand the concept of international money. Herr Brok, who has not come off the phone since he came in only to listen to himself, was rather interesting. He started off this debate by suggesting it was a great success – the euro. One wonders what planet Herr Brok lives on. Dear oh dear! It is a complete disaster. If he thinks it is such a success, I would argue that he speak to the millions of unemployed people, youngsters mainly in the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the rest of Europe, who are suffering from this disgraceful, fraudulent and deceitful currency which was rammed down the throats of the people of Europe against their will. There is no mandate, Mr Duff. There is no mandate, with your blue card hanging up there, let me tell you. There is no mandate for this. The British people have not been given a vote on this whole shebang of European Union, and neither has anybody else. There is only one way this ridiculous currency spanning many different economies against a whole background of failed ideals can survive – and if you understood international money to any degree, you would understand this – and that is by having a financial, central, statist fiscal policy. If you think you have a mandate for that, you are a disgrace and a scoundrel. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I have to say to Mr Duff that at the time, in the mid-1990s, some of the class greeted my views with some scepticism. I still now go back to the occasional reunion dinner and most of them come up to me and say, ‘My god, Godders, you were right’. And I am, by god! I was right in spades, was I not? (Applause) Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, there is a lot of self-congratulation going on here in the European Union on International Women’s Day. It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog’s breakfast of it. You talk about maternity leave. All that is happening with draconian maternity leave, let me tell you, Madam, is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business. So you have done them no favours. We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court, which means that even if young women could get a job, they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled. And now you are talking about quotas. What kind of madness is this? Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business – professional women – are being patronised on quotas. Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say, are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business? The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, this is simply not true and is not borne out by the statistics in my country. Speak to any small businessman you like in my country. I am not interested in the honourable Member’s country or other people’s countries, I am interested in my country and my economy, and I can tell you that all businessmen and women will say that they will not employ young women because of the draconian maternity laws. I wish, I desperately wish, you would come into the real world; hands up any of you who have had a real job! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Oviir, I would simply counsel her to let companies do their business. The less you regulate, the less you tax, the less you interfere, the quicker our economy will recover. That is what it is all about, and that is something the honourable Member does not understand. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Estrela, I can assure her that the problem with my country is that we have given up self-government and we are Members of the European Union: that is my country’s problem. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, in reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki, I would say that I believe that children are the responsibility of their parents and nobody else. I do not accept that somebody takes responsibility for his neighbour’s children. It is for the parents to take responsibility for their children and that is how it should be. The more self-responsibility we had in Europe – and indeed, the world – the better it would be, in my view. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– The views expressed by Herr Schulz meet the case. He is an undemocratic fascist. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, yet again there is one rule for Herr Schulz and one rule for everybody else. This is a disgrace. I have been elected – re-elected – to vote in this Chamber by the people of Yorkshire (your own constituency, I might add), with a democratic mandate which you yourself do not enjoy, Mr President, because you switched parties and they voted for the Conservatives. I have no intention of apologising, I have no intention of leaving this Chamber: you must have me escorted out, Sir! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, about five and a half years ago, I caused something of a furore by suggesting that any small businessman with his brain in the right place would be mad to employ a woman of childbearing age. Since then, it has got worse and worse as the balance in favour of employees versus employers has got completely out of control. One of my constituents from York wrote to me last year saying never mind about employing women of childbearing age, any small businessmen who employs anybody has got to be out of his mind. We have an extraordinary situation here, do we not? We have young women desperately keen to get into work, desperately keen to work for companies, especially small companies – which are the driving force of the United Kingdom economy – and we have employers who are too terrified to take them on. That is the problem we have. We are making it – here in this place with so little commercial experience amongst our Members – almost impossible for small businesses to employ young women, which is something they want to do. I used to think it was some sort of Chinese conspiracy where this place made it almost impossible for a European economy to function, and that behind the scenes the Chinese were making it so bad that eventually we had to import absolutely everything from China. Well, I have another hypothesis here, namely, that perhaps the women who are making it so difficult in committees, in the Commission and in this place for small businesses to employ young women have an eye to the main chance. I would suggest that when the electorate quite rightly look at them and boot them out in a few years’ time for their incompetence and their stupidity, they will only be able to get back into the workplace because they are in middle or late middle age. The game will be cleared for them. That is my hypothesis. I can think of no other sensible answer to this sort of ludicrous interference between employer and employee. If you think that is a weird hypothesis, anything that puts up with the way you talk about climate change, believe me, nothing is too stupid for this Chamber. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, when last I met the Commissioner, I expressed grave concern that regulation of the City of London was going to move to Brussels. He seemed surprised that I was so concerned, but since he has taken office, he might have come to understand that a significant portion of the United Kingdom’s GDP actually comes from its financial services sector. It is very important to the United Kingdom. Indeed, it picks up most of the tabs. The GBP 45 million a day we send to this place to support the rather suspicious European Union project, which has not given any of our electorate an actual say, is one of those tabs. In fact, you must understand that big salaries and big pensions do not grow on trees. Commissioner, I also mentioned to you that we could learn something from the old dominions – Australia, Canada – who have not suffered from this problem, and you rather charmingly, and in a very Gallic way, suggested that Australia was a long way away. I hope, now that you have been in office for a little while, you will understand that perhaps such a parochial approach will not do. I still worry, Commissioner. I still fret that we will have regulation from the usual mishmash of ignorant bureaucrats, parliamentary committees with their usual complement of cryptocommunists, anachronistic socialists, journeymen politicians, fringe greenies, a sprinkling of well-meaning housewives, and grandmothers exploring their new third age. The outcome will be the same as all the other EU projects: fishing, agriculture, energy, employment, immigration and, horror of horrors, the ticking time bomb of the single currency. It is an astonishing litany, is it not, of failure? You would think the European Union would get something right once by accident. I am sorry, but I am not satisfied. I am desperately cross that the British Conservative Party has given away the City of London regulation. If Dave Cameron had been the Admiral at Trafalgar, it would be Admiral Villeneuve on the plinth in Trafalgar Square now. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Commissioners – the three amigos if I may call you such – last session, Mr President, you had to scamper away. I think you had an urgent appointment. You missed my words of wisdom and I am glad to see that you are here to receive them today because I feel I have some wisdom to offer. You are in such a pickle actually, are you not? One could almost feel sorry for you but of course, you know, you bring some of this on yourselves. The common currency experiment – which is an experiment that was doomed to failure; I remember lecturing at Cambridge University back in the 1990s, explaining why it was deeply flawed and could not work and I gave it about 10 years and I am afraid it looks as though I was right – was flawed even by your own rule book. What in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book. You threw it away! You welcomed every fiscal dysfunctional economy into the eurozone, including Greece – which was going to hasten the demise of the eurozone, and it thus comes as no surprise. I am not a johnny-come-lately to the demise of the euro. It was always written in the runes, as it were. To suggest now that we have only just found out that Greece was broke is intellectually dishonest. I was in the City at the time and we were buying Greek bonds at 10% coupons, they fell to five and it was a one-way bet – a bit like having the winner of the horse before the race had even started! Our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy junk debt. They redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple A ratings. What are our central banks doing now? The very same thing. They are buying in the secondary market and buying junk bonds, repackaging them as triple A. This is just how we got into this pickle to start with. If you want to get out of this mess, you need to get rid of the political-establishment support for commercial banks and get rid of central banks, which are actually part of the problem, not the solution. Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, credit rating agencies sold their souls to the devil some years ago when they started to rely on those companies whose bonds needed grading for payment. He who pays the piper calls the tune. It inevitably led to misgrading. Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet. They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all. Paradoxically, it is usually the hedge funds who find out the truth behind the numbers. They exposed Enron, for example. But the truth about numbers can be unpopular, especially here, which is why we hate them. However, even the coke-sniffing youngsters at the credit agencies know that Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and Portugal are broke. Kaput
 is kaput
 in any language! So what does this House propose? Our own credit rating agency paid for by us, guaranteed to dance to our tune. It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone’s failed economies. The question is, who would these fool? I suggest, with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents, virtually nobody. When the people of Europe realise that they have been the guinea pigs in a gigantic failed currency experiment, they will burn this place down and guillotine the lot of us, and who could blame them? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Madam President, it is a shame that Mr Barroso has fled the Chamber. I feel he would have learned so much from me this evening! I would counsel you all not to worry too much about the EU in 2020 because I rather fancy it will not be here! It will go the same way as the Soviet Union which it so resembles, and for the same reasons: it is centralised; it is corrupt; it is undemocratic and it is incompetent; it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats; it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as ‘climate change’. Whenever the people of Europe get the chance of a referendum, they reject it. The British, of course, have not been given the chance to have their say, thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country, aided and abetted by an EU-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the BBC. The EU is already crumbling. The scenes in Greece today will spread through the other Mediterranean countries sooner than we can imagine, and they will eventually reach northern European countries, which are being left to pick up the tab. Our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles! Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I appear to have been living in some sort of parallel universe here, hearing about the success of the euro. Let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we? Unemployment, youth unemployment in the Iberian Peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic. It has been at 30-40% for years. Nothing to do with the crisis at all. A complete disaster. GDP per capita in the USA is miles ahead of the European Union. GDP in the Pacific Rim is miles ahead of the GDP in the Union. No, the euro has not been successful at all. It is already failing. It is already crumbling before our eyes. Just look at some economic basics. There is no lender of last resort, which is why we have this Greek crisis and a Portuguese crisis round the corner. There is no lender. This is impossible in global, in currency management, whether it is an optimal currency zone or not. There is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak. Let me just remind everybody here about something else if I may. There are two sorts of people: wealth creators, those people that go out and work in the private sector and create wealth, and there are the others who spend wealth, which are politicians and bureaucrats and there are too many of us. Far too many of us. We are the monkey on the economies’ back and, until these currency zones start cutting down public sector spending, it is going to get worse and worse and worse. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, a few weeks ago, my estimable friend and Yorkshire colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, brought the chairman of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to this assembly and presented him as a legend in his own lunchtime and a top climate science guru – and I have to say that he certainly looked like a guru to me – but it turns out that he is a railway engineer who writes mucky books. Now, I have nothing against railway engineers. Some of my best friends are railway engineers and no doubt they read mucky books – that is not the point – but it might explain perhaps, does it not, why the IPCC has come out with so much absurd nonsense in the last few years. Would it not be a good idea if the Commission, perhaps, were to write to the IPCC and suggest they get a new chairman, perhaps a tad better qualified? Godfrey Bloom,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, taxation as a concept has not really changed very much in the last 3 000 years, has it? The rich and the powerful stealing money from ordinary people to make their own lives more comfortable. Where there has been a change in modern times is that now taxation is ‘for the benefit of the taxed’: that somehow we are being taxed pro bono
. In order to perpetuate this myth, we invent periodic scares to frighten people into submission. The latest of these scares is of course that, if we do not cough up green taxes, we will all boil to death – reminiscent of the medieval religions, is it not, which played the same game: pay up or burn in hell. Tax harmonisation is a concept dreamed up by the modern political class to make sure that no government steals too little from its people: a sort of thieves’ cartel if you will. May I suggest, if you really want tax harmonisation, that the Commission and the bureaucracy pay the same taxes as the electorate, that they bear the same burden of tax as the rest of us, before the electorate storm this building and hang us from the rafters, as they have every right to do. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, you can, of course, tell that I am a sceptic because I do not dress like a scarecrow. I fought my way through the blizzard in Copenhagen, like many of you did. It is interesting, is it not, that we have had the coldest winter so far on record in London for 30 years? It is the same in Poland, Korea and China. We have had the coldest temperatures in Florida, Arizona, Texas – the first snow in Texas, I think, for a hundred years. Of course, as Giles Coren of the London Times
 said, my goodness me, we simply do not get it – of course that is what global warming is all about: we have got to get used to freezing temperatures. Well, we have seen the Al Gore hockey stick, which is still, I gather, being shown in London state schools – Al Gore, snake oil salesman, crook! We have seen Professor Jones from the University of East Anglia – crook! And now – you will not know about this yet because it has been kept out of the public domain – the New Zealand National Climate Database: I have the figures here – all fraudulent. When are you all going to wake up? Scam, scam, scam! (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, I rise very quickly and on a point of order. You said a few minutes ago that you were bound by the rules, and what can you do when you are bound by the rules? I fully understand that, and so does the House. Can I assume, and can we assume, that you will be bound by the rules of this House for your whole term of office? Because your predecessor felt he was not bound by the rules, and on the basis of explanations of vote he tore the rule book up because he did not feel bound by it. I leave it with you, sir. Godfrey Bloom  (EFD

– Mr President, I take this opportunity of wishing well the east European cities in the coming of the very early skiing season, with the snow and ice that have come there. Of course, this is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, and temperatures have been broadly flat since 1998. So we are all talking here about something which is not happening. Time and time again I have heard Members here talk of CO2
 as a pollutant. A pollutant! It is a life-giving natural gas. It gives me the impression that some of our Members have not had the benefit of a formal education. Isn’t this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people’s trouser pockets to steal yet more tax from them? Isn’t this all about political control? Isn’t this all about politics and big business? The whole thing is a sham – this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2
 is causing global warming. Enough please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy. Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, the influx of workers into the UK must be controlled by the UK Government. It is a simple matter of sovereignty. Britain already has a housing shortage. Hospitals and schools are not coping with the ever-growing immigrant population. Britain must protect its own citizens who have paid their taxes and built the country. The massive influx of immigrants produces an oversupply, adding to the unemployment problem, reducing job availability and reducing pay for working people. And yet, here we are facing yet more rules. These rules take control away from UK authorities, making management of the infrastructure impossible. Britain has not discriminated against foreign workers, and those willing to integrate with the existing population have been accepted, but now enough is enough. You say the free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom of EU citizens, a cornerstone of the internal market. I say a fundamental right of the UK is to roll away this stone and gain independence from Europe. We need our independence now. Sadly, a great British trade unionist and defender of working people, Bob Crow, died today. I wish the Left would embrace his views in this debate. Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, the Fourth Railway Package removes choice and dictates how to run a railway. Currently, Member States choose to directly award public service contracts or organise competitive tenders. This is yet another EU one-size-fits-all imposition inflicted on the UK, stopping any government from even considering alternatives to the current failed UK privatised model of railways.  So this EU package imposes: one, a dramatic cost escalation due to fragmentation; two, tax increases due to private train company subsidies; three, passengers facing the highest rail fares in Europe; four, minimal investment because profits are given to shareholders instead of reinvesting.  Directly-operated railways on the East Coast mainline prove that publicly owned and operated railways deliver increased performance, with much lower subsidy than private operators. UK governments must have the freedom to implement alternative models in line with the interests of passengers and of taxpayers. The UK Government must run its own affairs without EU interference in UK sovereignty. All the UK really needs is independence. Mike Nattrass  (EFD

  Mr President, here we have more legislation from the EU sausage machine to waste UK civil servants’ time and confuse citizens. I have listened to debates on the length of chickens’ beaks, inquiries into how much wine there is in a wine[nbsp ]gum and facts about rotten fruit leading to drunken reindeer which then savage people. The message-tapping CIA must be bored out of their tiny minds. You would serve your countries better by staying at home and chewing cardboard. There was a time when the British thought the Italians were amusing: ignoring the rules after making so many. We now understand that an over-supply of silly rules leads to disrespect for the law, and pedestrian crossings become suitable only for those with a suicidal tendency. We have far too much law. EU rules are openly broken and are not enforced by the Commission. This puts those who obey the rules into an adverse trading position. The failure to enforce EU law on the size of chicken cages, causing problems with egg production, is just one very costly example. Should you have further rules and mad-cap ideas up your sleeves, I suggest you shove them up your armholes or, like the Italians, make love not law. UKIP backs Westminster as the place where UK law must be made. For these reasons, UKIP will vote against this new law. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, you will be aware that many in the UK object – object – to the imposed EU citizenship and do not want it. They love Europe but they hate the EU because it is dictatorial and undemocratic. The following letter from constituent Alan Sheath illustrates this point. ‘Dear Mr Nattrass, on 7 February 1992, Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty. Unbeknown to myself and the vast majority of British subjects, every person in the UK, including Her Majesty The Queen, became a European citizen by ratification. Neither I nor 60 million other British subjects were consulted or asked to vote. I do not want this citizenship, so please advise me what measures there are in place to renounce it. I remain content with my British birthright’. I see from the papers on this debate that the EU is now forcing the UK to wreck its social security systems by opening the floodgates to Europe and the UK is being forced to abide by the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We do not want foreign legal frameworks, so when can the British people have a democratic vote please? Mike Nattrass  (NI

 Mr President, between 1958 and 1976, Iceland fought the cod wars with Britain. Now, cod stocks are rising because of Icelandic fish management. Compare that with the former UK fishing grounds, now in EU hands. Lost and ruined. The UK’s European dream turned into a nightmare. Established fishing communities die when the EU boats move in. My message to Iceland is obvious. If you join, you will lose your fish, your freedom and your currency and there is no regard for quotas or regulations in the EU. For the love of cod, do not do this. Say no. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Madam President, increasing the independence and powers of national bodies is good. The failings of the railway package are laughable, and the share of freight being moved by rail has actually fallen since the first railway package in 2001. Are the EU regulations enforced? The Commission will not enforce the regulations on battery cages for hens, which may well force producers who have complied out of business. So what is this about enforcement? Will cash-strapped national governments pay their fines? Some pay fines then continue to break the same rule, because the annual revenue collected exceeds the amount of the annual EU fine. The Commission has taken 13 Member States to the European Court of Justice for failing to correctly implement various parts of the railway package. Was anything enforced? Here, the EU sought control over national policy-making decisions on railways: for example, stopping the political will to run nationalised railways. These are matters of national sovereignty and the freedom of the voters – not the EU. The report criticises Member States for lack of investment to meet this package, but we are in the middle of an economic crisis. The legislation does not require clarification or improvement. It clearly should be scrapped. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President: So the EU seeks to raise EU revenue by taxation on trucks? Well, I ask UK voters what they think of the EU and the usual answer is ‘I do not think we should join’. The UK has been politically taken over. UK law is made in Strasbourg, a monster red-tape factory is closing industry, and now we have tax but, because it is not football, the people are not informed. The UK media avoid EU reality, brains are fed with TV soaps and reporters say the EU does not affect local issues. The EU is not news. This report seeks to raise tax from tolls on trucks, partly funding the trans-European TEN-T project, which includes linking high-speed EU trains. So, when the EU raises taxes in the UK, will the people respond by kicking the EU in the ballot box? No, because they are not informed. The final EU superstate takeover by stealth will be a taxpayers’ sleepwalk into Europe. The defences are down, the press do not care and the UK is asleep, so get those unfortunate truckers taxed. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, Mrs Kalniete wants to relaunch the Single Market and makes it sound like a V-2 rocket: extremely dangerous but never on target. Mr Correia de Campos is concerned about movement of workers. Well, so am I. The EU has swamped the United Kingdom with extra workers. The United Kingdom sees the world as the market. The straightjacket of the EU regulation is closing our industry, stopping innovation when it is ahead of the regulations and closing traditional industry, where the product is good but different from the approved continental version. Small business is the victim here. The United Kingdom is amongst those which do comply, yet it suffers because it does: for example, expensive compliance in the pig and egg industries with regulations that the Commission will not enforce, making our product uncompetitive. I have many more examples, but have been allocated just one minute to save small businesses. Mike Nattrass  (NI

– Mr President, in view of what we have just been speaking about, I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us. I would like your reassurance that the investigation into Brussels security breaches, some involving firearms, is being vigorously pursued. These breaches have put our staff, our guests and ourselves at serious risk. May I also have your assurance that senior management will be held accountable where appropriate, and that these soldiers will not be sacrificed in order to protect the generals? (Applause) Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages, but it is about the ability of the EU to oversee the single market. States were given 10 years to comply by 1 January 2012 or the product would be illegal. The Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, British and others have complied, but certain large producers have simply refused. This involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money. The regulation has put about 15 pence on a dozen eggs. Those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage. Eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the EU. One producer borrowed GBP 10 million to comply with this directive. He did the right thing. Is the Commission going to renege and make his eggs uncompetitive? If more time is given, then the moral of this story is that, if the EU makes a directive, it pays to ignore it. Mike Nattrass  (NI
).  
– Mr President, the Commission proposed this directive in 2008 and there were concerns about placing excessive burdens on the scientific research industry. The proposal will dilute certain restrictions and I note that the requirement for sharing animal research data has been removed. Some 12 million animals are being used in experiments in the EU each year and this proposal could increase their suffering. We must reduce the need for experimentation on animals. Civilised human beings will try to strike a balance between the need for research and the obligation to respect the lives of other creatures on this planet. These decisions require the wisdom of Solomon. I regret, I have to say, I have to ask the question: does the EU Parliament have such wisdom? Mike Nattrass,

 Madam President, the British public are aggressively against whaling. If Britain’s hands are tied to one harmonised EU abstention on whaling, it will guarantee a return to slaughter. The inhumane Japanese are giving incentives to Third World countries to stop: and look at the return to whaling. It is murder. The Japanese Government should be regarded as socially unacceptable for doing this in a modern world. The British were once heavily involved but have consigned the mistake to a previous century. If the UK is stopped by the EU from voting against this, while the Japanese and others murder these beautiful, sensitive and intelligent mammals, the UK public will vote to leave the EU in uncontrollable anger. It will be the kiss of death for Britain’s membership of the EU. John Stuart Agnew, Marta Andreasen, Gerard Batten, John Bufton and Mike Nattrass  (EFD

 While we recognise that Cuba is a Communist tyranny and while we want to see Cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state, we do not recognise the EU in this process. Mike Nattrass,

– Mr President, to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom, the UK Government has implemented the EU rail package. This is mainly because, these days, the Lib-Lab-Con sit at Westminster and like to be told what to do, having given away control to the EU. The separation of train operators and separation of the rail network is leading to major problems, courtesy of the EU. No wonder 21 countries are too wise to get caught in an EU rail web leading to mayhem on all stations to Brussels. I am not a Socialist, but if you need an integrated transport system, then state ownership is best – and not separation into multiple private hands. Having six different companies on the network between Birmingham and Berlin will create a complete ‘dog’s breakfast’, or should I say a ‘Dachshunds Frühstück
’. When Eurorail is broken up to allow the surplus capacity to be run by different companies, we will no longer have rolling stock, just laughing stock. Brian Simpson, who is responsible for this debate, is a member of the Labour Party. Labour was once Socialist, and he was elected by people who still think Labour is Socialist. Yet here he is, hiding in the EU, away from his faithful supporters. What is he calling for? He is calling for privatisation. More than that; he is calling for an EU model which does not work and is against the wishes of his own voters. He is, in fact, the ‘Fat Controller’, creating fat pay packets for fat cats. The one thing that we can be sure of is that there is fat chance that this EU directive will be accepted, as it will derail the EU rail network. Mike Nattrass,

– Madam President, I come from the West Midlands, the home of the so-called ‘Tipton Taliban’, who were detained at Guantánamo. As a UKIP MEP, I must agree that seizure and deportation of people from one country to be tried in another, without judicial oversight, and to face foreign imprisonment, is an alien process. It is an affront to liberty, democracy, accountability and natural human rights. I can give you a list of British citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way, into squalid and unfit jails, not at the hands of the CIA and its rendition programme, but at the hands of the EU Member States under the European arrest warrant which this House created. It was made in the EU. So, before you condemn the USA, look in the mirror and see your own hypocrisy.

 Mr President, in his introduction President Barroso said that the First World War was an industrial war. Indeed, you have only got to drive two hours up the A4 motorway from here and visit the battlefield at Verdun to see exactly what he was talking about.  For those who have not visited, I think it is probably the grimmest battlefield on the Western Front or indeed anywhere in the world, and certainly the grimmest I have visited. It was something that had such a huge psychological effect on France that it very much dominated the thinking of Monnet and Schuman post-1945 – that this awful thing must never happen again. Those of us in politics will all remember that famous photograph of a quite large German Chancellor Kohl and a rather small French President Mitterrand holding hands, standing in front of the ossuary at Douaumont. The whole European project comes from the disaster that was sparked by the First World War. It is entirely understandable that people should have sought ways to prevent such awfulness. The difficulty is that they chose the wrong target. Monnet and Schuman decided – and this view is shared today by Mr Barroso, Mr[nbsp ]Cohn-Bendit and others – that it was the existence of the nation state that led to war and therefore we had to abolish the nation state. Actually, what we should have focused on, post-1945, was not the abolition of states, but making sure that the European states were democratic, because democratic nation states do not go to war with each other. So I have to say that I believe the whole European project is based on a falsehood. It is potentially a dangerous falsehood, because if you try to impose a new flag, a new anthem, president, army, police force, foreign policy – and whatever else – without first seeking the consent of the people, you are in danger actually of creating the very nationalisms and resentments that you sought to snuff out in the first place. We have done all this before. We did it after the First World War in the Balkans. We said that we could not have all these little Balkan states going around fighting with each other. We said that we should bring them together and give them one flag, one anthem and one president and call it Yugoslavia. It led to horrific wars from 1990 and the deaths of tens of thousands of people, as they fought to get out of a false state.  The European Union is making a very similar mistake, because there is no consent for this project. I have heard people this morning talking about the need for a United States of Europe on a federal model. You can only have that if people give consent for it, and nobody has done so. When the EU put the constitution to the peoples of Europe – the first time it really came clean with the electors – they rejected it.  I am not against Europe, but I am against this Europe. I want a Europe of independent, sovereign nation states that trade together, work together and cooperate together. I believe the European elections this year will mark a turning point. The tide is turning. The EU is backing an outdated model that seeks to get rid of a problem that actually has not existed since 1945. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, even by the standards of this place, today’s atmosphere has been leaden. A great global political leader, Mr Barroso, comes along and out of 750 Members, 44 people turn up to listen. Why is that? Well, I have noticed something: I have been here fifteen years, but in the last five years something really big has changed. The European dream is crumbling, absolutely crumbling. There are a few maniacs in the front row here and in your Commission who of course still want a United States of Europe, but actually out there in the Member States they do not. And most of the MEPs here, yes, they want a job, yes, they want to be re-elected, but the enthusiasm for this project is dying. Why? Well you have made two big mistakes. The first mistake was of course to extend the eurozone. It would have been OK had it just been Germany and a few northern European countries, but to bring the Mediterranean into the eurozone has been a disaster. The second mistake was to allow the free movement of people to southern and to Eastern Europe. We in the United Kingdom – who have been the most open country with regard to immigration of any European country through a history that has lasted hundreds of years – now have 4[nbsp ]000 migrants a week who come to Britain from the European Union and stay for a year or more. These are the two realities that have hit home to people: the EU does not work economically, and open-door migration is fundamentally changing societies in ways that people do not want. Listen to the economics. Mr Barroso, you talked today about the possibility of an industrial renaissance in Europe, which sounded good. Lighter-touch regulation – all very encouraging. And then you say: but we must pursue our climate-change carbon targets. The Americans have gone for shale gas and reduced energy prices. The Chinese are digging up coal in quantities we cannot fathom and building two coal-fired power stations every week. This policy of economic unilateralism on climate change is what is destroying jobs in Europe, and the electors are going to have a chance in 72 days’ time to give their verdict. I suspect the next European Parliament will be very much more exciting than this one has been this morning. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Had there been a proper question there, I might try to answer it. Euroscepticism is growing right across the European Union. Nobody here, not even the maniacs that believe in the project, would question that. It is coming in all shapes and forms. It is on the right, it is in the centre, and it is on the left. The reason is of course – and you come from Ireland, so you should know better than anybody – that actually no one has ever given consent for a political European Union. The French clearly – followed by the Dutch – rejected the Constitution. They rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty, and only one country had a referendum on that. That was Ireland, and the people of Ireland rejected it. So you cannot tell me that there is popular support for a United States of Europe. Mrs Reding may believe it, Mr Barroso may believe it, one or two in the front row may believe it, but the peoples of Europe do not believe it. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I have sat here this morning feeling like the odd man out. To me it is beyond parody for the Greek Finance Minister, Mr Kourkoulas, to come along here and tell us our fortune: the policies are bearing fruit, we are going to tackle unemployment. And no-one says anything! No, because, of course, everybody here is tied up with the same obsession that the euro must and will work; the obsession that you will use the crisis to build a United States of Europe. What you could have told them, Mr[nbsp ]Kourkoulas, is that, according to the respected medical journal The Lancet
, there are now 800[nbsp ]000 people in Greece without access to welfare or medical care. You could have told them that. But even if you had, they would not have listened, so obsessed are they with building the euro. OK, a simple lesson in economics: when you have two countries that are at completely different stages of the economic cycle, one currency needs to devalue. But if those countries are pegged or tied inside the same currency and they cannot devalue, you have to devalue the country – and that is what is happening to the Mediterranean. We are devaluing the Mediterranean, and it is leaning towards Third World status. No amount of socialist state spending can mend this imbalance. It is about time, if people here cared for the citizens of Europe, particularly in the south, that we admitted the euro does not work for southern Europe and it is time we broke it up and gave countries currencies that reflect their current economic status.

 The point that the late Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, made is that it is tough enough to have an interest rate that works for Newcastle and London, let alone to have one that works across the whole of Europe, so there is a valid economic argument.  However, the taxpayers in London do not object strongly to transfers going to Newcastle or Scotland or wherever they may be needed because we are part of the same country. The problem you have with the euro area is not just this huge economic imbalance between north and south, but that increasingly the taxpayers of the north do not want to go on subsidising the south because there is no sense of European identity. We are very different countries. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, I must congratulate you, Mr Samaras, for getting the Greek Presidency off to such a cracking start. I am sure your overnight successful negotiations in the trialogue on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) will have them dancing in the streets of Athens. No matter that your country, very poorly advised by Goldman Sachs, joined a currency which it was never suited to; no matter that 30 % are unemployed, that 60 % of young people are unemployed, that a neo-Nazi party is on the march, that there was a terrorist attack on the German embassy. No, do not worry about all that, because the trialogue on MiFID has been a success, and in many ways it sums up the two Europes: the Europe that is talked about in here by the dreamers, who want to impose a united states of Europe with an identity and currency, and the real world out there. And you come here, Mr Samaras, and tell us that you represent the sovereign will of the Greek people? Well, I am sorry, but you are not in charge of Greece, and I suggest you rename and rebrand your party. It is called New Democracy. I suggest you call it No Democracy, because Greece is now under foreign control. You cannot make any decisions, you have been bailed out and you have surrendered. Democracy: the thing your country invented in the first place, and you cannot admit that joining the euro was a mistake, because of course Mr Papandreou did that, didn’t he? He even said there should be a referendum in Greece – and within 48 hours the unholy trinity that now run this European Union had him removed and replaced by an ex-Goldman Sachs employee puppet. We are run now by big business, big banks and, in the shape of Mr Barroso, big bureaucrats, and that is what these European elections are really going to be all about. It is going to be a battle of national democracy versus EU state democracy. Whatever you may say in this Chamber, the people out there do not want a united states of Europe, they want a Europe of sovereign states trading and working together, and I believe the European elections are going to mark a watershed. Until now everybody has thought – much as they may not like the development of the European Union – that it was inevitable. That myth of inevitability will be shattered by the European elections this year. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, I know it is seasonal to talk about the 12 days of Christmas, but I want to talk about the 21-day count down to the opening of the doors to 29 million poor people from Romania and Bulgaria. It does, I think, mark a pivotal moment in British politics. Very often in Britain, MEPs complain that they do not have a high enough profile with the public. I want to try and change that today because Brigadier Geoffrey Van Orden sitting behind me here, British Conservative, was the rapporteur, the sponsor for Bulgaria joining the European Union and for us having a total open door to all of those people. So well done, Brigadier, I want all the British people to know who you are and what your achievements are and of course what free movement means – it means free health care; it means free education; it means free access to the benefit system; it means an open door to the criminal gangs and the modern day Fagins who will of course benefit from the fact that London is the most successful and wealthy international city in Europe. Already the situation is so bad that 92% of ATM crime in London last year was committed by Romanians. I am not scapegoating in any way and I know that a lot of people that come from Bulgaria and Romania will be very decent people who want to work hard and want to better their lives, but free movement does not work in the European Union now that we have countries that are poor. For a man that comes from Bucharest and works in London and gets child benefit for the two children back home: that child benefit is worth more than he can actually earn doing a menial job in Bucharest and that is the reason why the numbers that come to Britain will indeed be absolutely enormous. I have said for some time, and now the British people agree, enough is enough. 80% of the British people do not want those borders to come down in 21 days’ time. It is unfair. It is unfair on working people. It is leading to lower wages. It is leading to higher youth unemployment and it is leading to divided communities. But of course it does not end here, because our Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, with the full support of Labour and the Lib Dems, now wants to extend this principle of open borders, as he says himself, from the Atlantic to the Urals. So it means countries like Kazakhstan, indeed the Ukraine, joining the European Union. I see that Tony Blair is now helping Albania join the European Union. Well good luck to them with that. We even want to extend it to Turkey joining the European Union. Our message is that a turkey is just for Christmas; it is not for political union; we do not want open borders. And, Mr Cameron, do not, next week at the summit, surrender in any way to deeper European military integration. Many in this room would have bombed Syria had Europe had that capability. Thank God it did not. On open doors, on European armies, the voters will have their say next May, and I think there is going to be a radical change. I think there is going to be an earthquake in British politics next May. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr Brons, thank you for the question. Can I make something clear to you? UKIP is not against immigration. We welcome immigration. We want immigration; but we want an immigration system based, as the Australian one is, on saying we want people who have got skills to bring to our country. We do not want people who have got life-threatening diseases. We do not want people who have got criminal records – though of course in Australia, in the old days, that was a prerequisite – and we want to make our own decisions on who comes to Britain. We are not discriminatory, we are not scapegoating, we just want to control our own borders and live in our own democracy and we cannot do that as members of this European Union. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, there is only one real debate going on here this week in Strasbourg: it is the fear stalking the corridors, the concern you have got about the rise of euro-scepticism. Years ago you were less worried. The few of us here who were euro-sceptics were treated as being mentally ill and sort of patted on the head. Now we are evil populists; we are dangerous; we are going to bring down western civilisation. It is clear that you do not get it, you do not understand why this is happening. Well, let me help you. In 2005 it was the pivotal moment of this project: the French and the Dutch had said ‘No’ to the EU Constitution. Mr Barroso stood up and said: ‘They did not really vote ‘No’. They did not understand what they were doing’. But they did. You see, ever since 2005, the real European debate has been about identity. What we are saying – large numbers of us – from every single EU Member State is: ‘We do not want that flag. We do not want the anthem that you all stood so ramrod straight for yesterday. We do not want EU passports. We do not want political union’. If you think about it, there is nothing extreme about that position. There is nothing right-wing about that position; there is nothing left-wing, indeed, about that position. It is a normal, sensible assertion of identity. What we are saying on our side of the argument – you see, you can scream and shout all you like, which really rather proves to me why you are going to do so badly in the European elections next year, because you are not listening – we want to live and work and breathe in a Europe of nation-state democracy. We want to trade together, we want to cooperate together. We are happy to agree sensible common minimum standards and, yes, we want to control our own borders, which is the rational, logical and sensible thing for any nation state to do. We are not against immigration or immigrants. We believe there needs to be a degree of control, and that is the message that is picking up support right across this continent. I genuinely think that there is an opportunity for an electoral earthquake to happen in the European elections next year, with a large number of people from all sides of this House who will come with a nation state agenda, who will come saying: ‘Let us have a Europe, as de Gaulle might have said, of the patries
; let us not have a Europe of political union’. You can abuse us all you like, but what we stand for is fair, principled and democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, not one in a thousand British people would know who Commissioner Andor was. They would not be able to pick him out of a line-up and yet he is really rather powerful. He is the governor. He is the man who decides who can come to Britain and who can claim benefits. He has more power than a British Government Minister. But I have to thank him for his study, because he is the one who has told us that there are 600 000 economically-inactive Eastern Europeans in Britain – something our own government was not able to tell us. I suppose I have to admire his commitment to his job. After all he is going to take the UK Government to court to make sure that we do not treat Eastern Europeans any differently to our own people. So it is certain that he means business. I know that this is a very complex area, but let us just look at one in-work social benefit, shall we? Child benefit. From Eastern Europe, at the moment, there are people to whom we are now paying child benefit for 50 000 children who do not even live in the United Kingdom. There is no possible justification for us doing that. It is costing us GBP 1 million a week, and it is yet another pull factor. But of course, this whole issue is going to get bigger, because we appear to have learnt nothing from 2004. If you allow the unrestricted free flow of people between poor and rich countries, do not be surprised when you get a big result. We had a government prediction of 13 000 people a year, and it was something like 400 000 a year for the first two years. So we open the doors next year to Romania and Bulgaria. It means more oversupply in the unskilled labour market, a greater burden on the National Health Service and our schools and, yes – sadly – it is going to mean more crime too. This issue will be the central issue of the European elections next year. It will be the central issue of whether Britain remains a member of the European Union. We are not against anybody from Eastern Europe, but we do believe that it is right and proper that we should restrict and decide who comes to live in our country. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the problem is not just Mr Barroso but the entire unelected government of Europe – and perhaps there is a chance for our citizens to reflect on where the real power lies in this Union. I have listened to Mr Barroso for nearly 10 years and I give him full marks for consistency. He is a man who likes fixed ideology. He probably picked it up when he was a Communist or a Maoist, or whatever he was, and for the last 10 years he has pursued Euro-federalism combined with an increasing green obsession. And yes, it has been good! For bureaucrats, big businessmen and landowners it has not been a bad decade, but it has been a disaster for poor people, unemployed people and those on low wages. The euro, which you, Mr Barroso, believed would give us monetary stability, has done the very opposite. It was a misconstruction from the start and it is pretty clear that youth unemployment, at nearly 50% across the Mediterranean, is probably nearly double what it would have been, as a direct result of the misconstruction that is the euro. The countries in question are in the wrong currency, but I know that you will never admit to that. I think the euro will die a slow and painful death, but you are all in denial about that. However, it is the green agenda that I really find more interesting. You keep telling us, Mr Barroso, that climate change is an absolute top priority and you have been greeted with near-hysteria in this place over the last 10 years. Those of us who have been sceptical have been mocked, derided and called deniers. We argued from the start that the science was not settled, and we have argued very strongly that the measures we are taking to combat what may or not be a problem are damaging our citizens. We have been proved to be right. Tens of millions have been forced into fuel poverty; manufacturing industry is being driven away because our competitors in China and America are going for cheap fossil alternatives; and wind turbines are blighting the landscapes and seascapes of Europe. Yet still today you go on about green growth. Well, the consensus is breaking down behind you. Commissioner Tajani said the other day that we face a systematic industrial massacre. It is time to stop this stupidity. To help you, there is the NASA photograph taken last August of the northern ice caps and there is the NASA photograph of the ice caps taken this year. The ice has increased by 60% in one year. Leading American scientists are now saying that we are going into a period of between 15 and 30 years of global cooling. We may have made one of the biggest and most stupid collective mistakes in history by getting so worried about global warming. You can reverse this in the next seven or eight months. You can bring down people’s taxes. If you do not do so, they will vote on it in the European elections of next year.

 Oh no, I’m sorry, old son, I haven’t accused you of not working – far from that. I have accused you of doing far too much and actually, collectively in this House, forming a consensus, and I am going to come back to this green agenda. You all formed the view that carbon dioxide emissions were leading to rapid global warming and that it was the greatest crisis that has ever faced mankind, and therefore we had to start taxing carbon. There has been no global warming, Sir, for twenty years. The ice caps have grown significantly over the last twelve months, and I am making a positive proposal that would put back into work tens of thousands of people, and I am saying: let us scrap these climate levies and let us see where the science goes over the course of the next few years. I cannot think of a more positive thing that has been said in this House this morning. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, next year’s European election will not be contested on the old division lines of left and right and several group leaders have agreed with that today. Frankly, that is all irrelevant. It will be contested between those of us that believe in national democracy within the nation state and those that believe that the 28 countries that are part of the EU are better governed by these institutions. That in a sense is what this comes down to.  But, Mr Barroso, those of us that believe in national democracy do not want to take us back to the Western Front or 1914. Those of us that believe in national democracy will say to you it is a healthy assertion of identity, but it also shows a deeper understanding of why the problems of Europe were caused in the past. It is democratic nation states in Europe, that are stable, that will not go to war with each other, which are a force for good and I would remind people that, without the vote in the House of Commons two weeks ago, we would now be at war in Syria. What better proof can there be that nation state democracy can be a force for good? Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, I represent a group which is against military action in Syria. We are against it not because we are pacifists; we are against it not because we do not care about the awful things going on there. We are against it because we think there is some pretty poor thinking going on. The idea that somehow the rebels are the good guys and Assad’s regime are the bad guys really is an over-simplification of a situation in which we know that al-Qa’ida has significant representation amongst the rebel groups. Of course, we have seen it all before: an endless series of military adventures over the course of the last 10 to 15 years. One such, in Afghanistan, is still going on and is not achieving any of the original aims. I was worried when I heard the Americans telling us, to begin with, that it was about punishing Assad and then, within a week, that it was about regime change – a position which I know the noble Baroness herself supports. We think that firing a thousand cruise missiles is likely to make an unstable situation even worse than it is now. In a sense, Baroness Ashton, you are sitting pretty because, as the highest-paid female politician in the world, luckily you have a non-job because the EU, thank goodness, has not yet got a foreign policy and, as a result of that, what we saw two weeks ago in the UK House of Commons was a nation-state democracy standing up and saying something. As a direct result of that vote in the House of Commons, we have not gone to war in Syria: we have entered a period of negotiations and Assad has a chance to prove to all of us whether he is a good man or a bad man. I do not know how this will play out but at least, Mr Verhofstadt, there is a chance of peace, and I know that you represent the kind of political class who believe that global influence can be achieved only through bombing. Well, luckily – unlike extreme EU nationalists like yourself – British democracy has proved that nation-state parliaments can actually made people rethink. And, Mr President, I have to say, as somebody who has been here now for 14 years, it is ironic that the view which I used to represent was called extreme, but you can see who are the extreme militarists now.

The ‘good guys versus bad guys’ story is really something I take from your own Foreign Secretary and party member William Hague, who was urging the international community to arm the rebels – which struck me, given that we know of al-Qa’ida’s involvement, as total and utter madness. I will remain cynical and sceptical, like much of the European public, about who has used those weapons until we get the full report and we get the intelligence right. We went to war in Iraq being told that Saddam had weapons of … (Interjection to Mr Verhofstadt, who had been shouting objections: ‘Why don’t you shut up and listen for a change? You really must be the vilest, rudest man in European politics and you rant on and the Chair lets you get away with it because you are the former Prime Minister of Belgium. Well, there we are.’)
 So, Mr Tannock, I understand what you are saying. I understand that something ghastly has happened here, but before you take military action you need to be certain you are going to make things better and not worse.

 Sir, I would say this to you. I have never described the Romanians as living like pigs. What I said was that the Romanians treat their Roma minority like pigs. All right? So let us get that absolutely clear. You and your country discriminate against a large group of people in a way we have not seen in Europe since the 1930s. All right? Now, look. I am not taking sides in this civil war. But I am saying this: that whether it is through the use of gas, or whether it is through the use of other forms of high explosives or bullets, there are terrible things happening in Syria – I understand that and I agree – but rushing to war as we did in Afghanistan, as we did in Iraq, was a mistake and Mr Cameron tried to bounce us into war and, thank goodness, the House of Commons has given us pause for thought. Surely that must be a good thing. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, for the first time this year not just Mr Barroso but also President Van Rompuy have come to the Chamber, and yet look around you. What have we got? Five percent turnout amongst Members? They have not missed much. Just the usual drivel about the fight against youth unemployment.  With 62% youth unemployment in Greece, and with Spain not far behind, it is perhaps about time we were honest and admitted we are causing it ourselves. We are doing it through the misconstruction of the euro, through the obsession with global warming and the over-regulated business model. Yet your recipe is more bureaucracy: a youth guarantee scheme, another six billion for the youth employment initiative, the setting-up of the European alliance for apprenticeships, backed up by the quality framework for traineeships, and the list goes on, and on: yet more highly-paid civil servants setting up organisations that will achieve nothing.  Until the euro is broken up, until you reverse the social market model you will not help youth unemployment. However I must concede you have had one great victory. A couple of years ago Mr Barroso said that the European Union was an empire, and your empire has just expanded. Indeed David Cameron appears to be the biggest cheerleader for the EU extending all the way to the Urals. No, you have got Croatia. You have planted your flag on Croatian soil. Not that there was much public support for this: only 22% of Croatians turned out to vote in the European Parliament elections. But there was plenty of support from the Croatian political class.  Oh yes, the Prime Minister who negotiated entry, Mr Sanader, who was jailed for ten years last year for selling national assets, has been backed up by the whole of Croatia. They have sold out their country for personal gain and to be on a bigger stage. A country that fought for 800 years to be independent has given it away after twenty years to these guys in front of us today. Well you may be getting away with it for the moment, but it is not going to last very long. There is a gathering electoral storm. It is coming on the left, in the centre and on the right. You can hardly fail to notice what has happened in big countries like France or Italy, what is happening in Finland, the Netherlands, and even in Britain. The European elections next year present the opportunity for us to show you, Mr Barroso, that the European project is reversible, and it needs to be reversed for the betterment of the peoples of Europe.

 Well there was a referendum in theory. You will notice that less than 50% of people turned out to vote; you will notice that millions of euros from the European institutions were poured for many years into Croatia; and you will notice that there was something called pre-accession aid – we can call it bribery if you like – that was poured into Croatia, and there was a prize.  We, in turn, offered a prize for the first Eurosceptic article that appeared in a Croatian newspaper. In the three years leading up to the referendum we did not have to give away any money. That is the point: it is a one-sided political debate and it is all about the power of Brussels and the greed and vanity of politicians in Member States.  I am paid by the European Parliament and what I am doing – just as the Scottish National Party do, and just as the Irish Nationalists in the 19th century did – is using that money to expose the waste, the fraud and the extent to which our countries are now governed by these Chambers. The sooner I get the opportunity, Sir, to be the turkey that votes for Christmas, I will do so! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, well, there is a great degree of unity here this morning. A common enemy: rich people and successful companies evading tax, which is of course a problem – avoiding tax, which is not illegal but gives this whole Chamber this morning a high moral tone and, as Mr Barroso says, it is all about the perception of fairness. There is the added bonus, of course, that it drives a wedge between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Caymans. But before we declare our virtues, perhaps we ought to look just a little bit closer to home, and I hope that the taxpayers all over Europe listen to this. If we look at the officials that work for the Commission and for Parliament, the highest category are people that earn a net take-home pay of just over GBP 100 000 a year and yet, under EU rules, they pay tax of 12%. It is tax fraud on an absolutely massive scale, and I would say to Mr Barroso: how can that be deemed to be fair? How can people out there struggling – the 16 million unemployed in the eurozone – look at these institutions not only paying people vast sums of money but allowing them tax and, also of course, pension benefits on a scale not seen anywhere else in the world? So I suggest we have a bit less of this high moral tone. And what have these officials given us? Well they were the architects of the euro, which is a complete disaster. Their obsession with global warming, which chimes very strongly here, means we are despoiling our landscapes and seascapes with these disgusting wind turbines and driving up energy prices. But never let it be said that I cannot acknowledge success when I see it, and I am sure the citizens of Europe will all clap and cheer loudly that the grave mortal danger of olive oil in dipping bowls has been removed by the officials. Well done, everybody! (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

I agree with you that tax evasion is a problem and is costing governments money, but we should remember that tax avoidance is legal. The biggest reason that tax havens are allowed to prosper is that we have got this very statist mindset that we must try to get as much tax out of successful individuals as we possibly can. If you do that, and if you have a very complicated tax system, people will do all they can within the law to avoid paying tax. The answer for Western governments is to learn some of the lessons from the 1980s in Britain and America: bring taxes down, simplify taxes, and then those who wish to obey the law have no need to use tax havens.

Madam President, 25 years ago Mrs Thatcher recognised the truth behind the European project. She saw that it was about taking away democracy from nation states and handing that power to largely unaccountable people. Knowing as she did that the euro would not work, she saw that this was a very dangerous design. We in UKIP take that same view, and I have tried over the years in this Parliament to predict what the next moves would be as the euro disaster unfolded. But, even in my most pessimistic speeches, I would never have imagined, Mr Rehn, that you and those in the Troika would resort to the level of common criminals and steal money from people’s bank accounts in order to keep propped up this total failure that is the euro. You even tried to take money away from the small investors, in direct breach of the promise you made back in 2008.  The precedent has been set, and if we look at countries like Spain, where business bankruptcies are up 45 % year on year, we can see what your plan is to deal with the other bail-outs as they come. I must say, the message this sends out to investors is very loud and clear: get your money out of the eurozone before they come for you.  What you have done in Cyprus has actually sounded the death knell of the euro. Nobody in the international community will have confidence in leaving their money there. And how ironic to see the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, say of your actions: ‘I can only compare it to some of the decisions taken by Soviet authorities.’ And then we have a new German proposal that says that actually what we ought to do is confiscate some of the value of people’s properties in the Southern Mediterranean eurozone States. This European Union is the new communism: it is power without limits. It is creating a tide of human misery, and the sooner it is swept away the better.  And what of this place? What of the Parliament? This Parliament has the ability to hold the Commission to account. I have put down a motion of censure debate on the table. I wonder whether any of you have the courage to recognise it and to support it? I very much doubt that. I am minded that there is a new Mrs Thatcher in Europe, and he is called Frits Bolkestein. He has said of this Parliament – remember, he is a former Commissioner – that it is not representative of Dutch or European citizens any more, and is ‘living out a federal fantasy which is no longer sustainable’. How right he is! Nigel Farage,

Mr President, the air is thick with denial in this Chamber this morning. There has been a major political event that has happened since we last met and no one has mentioned it: Italy had an election. 55 % of the electorate voted for euro-sceptic political parties. Indeed, Mr Grillo’s movement managed to get 26 %. It is quite tough in European politics these days to tell who the comedians are.  What is absolutely clear is that eurozone membership is completely incompatible with nation state democracy. You can do what you like to take away the powers of national parliaments but people will go on voting, and there is a trend developing right across Europe towards euro-sceptic parties getting and stronger.  There is complete denial about the eurozone crisis. You would think listening to everybody this morning that it is over. Mr Barroso comes out with a technocratic speech that everything is fine and dandy. Mind you, this was far better than the unutterable drivel we had from Olli Rehn yesterday, which sent many Members to sleep. But the EU is not facing up to the consequences of what it has done. Mr Verhofstadt talks about a lost generation in Spain; Mr Daul talks about youngsters struggling to be fed by their families in Greece. All of that is true, but it is being caused by the euro – and that is what the EU is failing to recognise.  The eurozone has been a complete economic disaster. But the real problem that the EU will not face up to though is the state of the French economy and the fact that France is now diverging by the month from Germany. So right at the very heart of the European project and the eurozone project there is a disaster coming down the track. I am afraid that, in the end, the whole thing is going to break up.  I would also point out that you are in denial over Romania and Bulgaria. Those countries are wracked with corruption and organised crime. They should never have been allowed to join the European Union and I want to make it absolutely clear: we in UKIP do not believe it is right and fair to have total open borders from next year for unlimited numbers of people from those countries to come to Britain to work but also, if they want, to claim benefits. As the results in the recent Eastleigh by-election showed, the British electorate are increasingly saying that enough is enough. It is not just us: the Mayor of Duisberg in Germany has now publicly said that the massive influx from Romania and Bulgaria is causing huge social problems. Ladies and gentlemen, we have to face up to it. We should not be in political union with Romania and Bulgaria. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

Let me give you
 some figures. They are not ones that I really feel comfortable talking about as they are so shocking. There are 68 000 Romanians living in Britain. Over the course of the last five years in just one police area, the Metropolitan Police, there have been – believe it or not – 27 000 arrests of Romanians. Over 90 % of ATM fraud that takes place in London is now being committed by Romanian criminal gangs, and that is just the Met figures. We have not got the figures from across the rest of the country. Whilst with immigration you can get good people coming from other countries, you can also get bad people. The point I made in my speech is that I am afraid that Romania and Bulgaria are in the grip of organised crime. We do not want those people coming into our country. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, the highlight today of this debate was the Liberal leader, Mr Verhofstadt, comparing the seven-year EU economic plan with the Soviet Union’s five-year economic plan – and it was said without any sense of irony at all, which I thought was delicious.  Well, as the leaders meet tomorrow to discuss this budget, what a curious position David Cameron finds himself in. He made the big speech; he talked about a referendum in the future, and yet he has been criticised at home for making us wait for perhaps up to five years before we can have our say. Most people doubt his Eurosceptic sincerity, indeed he emphasised in that speech how pro-European Union he is, and yet here today he is met with a sort of venomous attack as if he is some terrible wrecker. I would have thought his chances of renegotiating very much look pretty limited, so I feel a bit sorry for him. He is like piggy in the middle, and you all remember from childhood what a frustrating and difficult place that is to be.  But he has made the speech, and we are going to have a proper debate in Britain about EU membership; but it is a debate that is changing. You see, the budget is not our top line issue. We pay in GBP 53 million a day. Whether that goes up to GBP 60 million or not, many of us are saying: why pay in a penny piece? Mr Barroso’s idea that a pound or a euro spent at European level is worth more than a pound or euro spent at national level – well, perhaps he has invented nuclear money, I have no idea. What perhaps we should recognise is that unemployment is actually being caused by Europe’s policies, in particular the mistaken euro project. The debate in Britain has changed and now it is about immigration. People in Britain are shocked at the change in every single city and market town since we opened the doors to eastern Europe in 2004. I have nothing against Bulgarians or Romanians, but it is unacceptable that we should open our doors to them unconditionally from 1 January next year. If Mr Cameron does not get a substantial renegotiation on the free movement of peoples then Britain will leave this Union. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, despite his own views, President Hollande is are doing rather a lot for the eurosceptic debate in France. President Hollande, the decision to reduce the retirement age, to increase the minimum wage and above all, of course, to introduce the ‘hate tax’ to make sure that all of your successful entrepreneurs – and now footballers – flee France, these all mean that the competitiveness gap between France and Germany is getting wider. That is now being reflected in a flight of capital from French banks. And people are beginning to notice that, ultimately, the euro is not just doomed in the Mediterranean, but it is going to be impossible for France and Germany to stay together inside the same economic and monetary union.  So, when your Employment Minister says the country is bankrupt, what do you do? The old trick of launching a foreign military intervention. Your troops go off to Mali; and yes, it is very good to see the smiling faces in Timbuktu for the moment, but you have done this on behalf of the European Union. It is now an EU mission. Just two days ago, Tony Blair said that the European Union is not about peace, but about power. I think what he meant is the European Union increasingly will be about war because the response to Mali, the response to it being an EU mission – and we have heard it all around the the Chamber today, the Liberals urging us to intervene militarily in Syria, support from right and left in this House – is that the EU should intervene militarily.  I have to say this: if you really think that taking on fundamentalist radical Islam in battle is something that we can somehow succeed in, I suspect we will launch ourselves in the same way we have in Afghanistan on a decade of unending, unwinnable misery. I do not want the United Kingdom to be part of a militaristic, warlike European Union, and that is the speech that I have heard both from you, President Hollande, and from most people in this Chamber today.

Mr President, we see there is nothing to worry about! Mr Barroso told us last week – I think I can say – that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome. Nothing to see here; move along – crisis over. Mr Draghi and Angela Merkel may well have committed the German taxpayer to unlimited sums of money in order to prop up the eurozone, and certainly ahead of the German elections there is perhaps not much else she could have done – and I do accept that the pressure from the markets, Mr Barroso, has eased for now. And from your perspective, Mr Barroso, and from everybody’s perspective I suppose, the champagne is still flowing, the chauffeur-driven cars are shiny, the salaries and of course the expenses are attractive, so everything is rosy in the EU garden. But I do not think we should be kidding anybody, Mr Barroso, because the fundamentals have not changed. In fact things deteriorated in 2012 – substantially. Unemployment has soared, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, with youth unemployment now up to 58% in two of those countries. Manufacturing, both in the north and south of the eurozone, is eroding with every single month that goes by, and there are the levels of human suffering that we are seeing – with pensions having been cut back, with soup kitchens growing all over the place, and with people in despair – and the prospects for 2013, particularly for the Mediterranean, are that it will be worse still.  And yet what the Commission and you, Mr Barroso, from your ivory tower, are saying is ‘let them eat cake’. You are showing that the European political class are out of touch, uncaring and simply plain wrong. But I am pleased to say that in Britain there is a proper European debate that is starting, driven I suspect by the rise of UKIP in the polls, and Mr Cameron, having postponed it for a few times, will speak this Friday on the issue. He wants to renegotiate the EU’s deal; he wants us to have an à la carte menu. Well, you may give him some concessions and you may not. His real plan is of course to deflect all of this so that there is not a referendum for five years. That or not, actually the longer this debate goes on, the more likely the UK is to leave the European Union. This debate will not stop and I am pleased to say that democracy, the arguments for democracy, are now staging a fight back and I look forward to when the United Kingdom does get that referendum. And I hope that many other countries will follow our lead, including Ireland, in claiming back their rights of democracy and self-government. Nigel Farage,

Mr President, there is a certain sense of irony here this morning because this is of course the week when you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, this great achievement. I thought the award bizarre, particularly as what we are discussing this morning is a new range of measures that will further pile on the agony for those southern euro zone states. Europe is now split from north to south, with increasing violence and enmity between the peoples of the north of Europe and the south of Europe, so I do not think the Peace Prize was really very appropriate. Not, of course, that that will pose you a problem tomorrow, because there are no leaders in those southern European countries who, frankly, have got the courage to stand up to the might of Brussels and challenge the euro zone project. However what you will have at tomorrow’s summit, yet again, is the curious case of Mr Cameron. On the one hand, he is a big ally. He resists having a referendum. He publicly states again and again that he wants Britain to remain a member of the European Union and, surprisingly, he has supported every one of your moves towards a fiscal union and banking union. Mr Verhofstadt indeed called Mr Cameron the greatest federalist outside the euro zone. Yet, on the other hand, he cannot go along with any of this because, politically, the financial transaction tax and the banking union are quite impossible in Britain. But every time there is a summit and the euro zone moves that little bit further forward, it leaves Britain — and Mr Cameron — even more marginalised. In fact it is barely worth him turning up tomorrow.  The great debate in Britain has always been that the single market has been the victory of our membership of the Union, and that we have great influence over that single market. Well, increasingly we are going to be excluded from the key decisions that affect that single market. Given the hostility – and I am sorry to disappoint my Conservative friends here, but there is hostility towards Britain in this place now, where people blame their economic problems on our City of London — frankly, the argument that the single market benefits Britain and that we have any influence over it is now disappearing, and very shortly I think you will be glad to see the back of us.

The story goes – Mr Cameron’s story and Mr Barroso’s story and the story of most people here – that the euro is something that needs to be saved. Therefore, the more money we throw at it, and the more guarantees we put behind, the better it is, because the break up of the euro zone would be a very difficult and perhaps perilous course to go down.  I am afraid that there is a problem with this. Nothing that is being done, whether it is the banking union or the fiscal union, does a single thing to change the problem that there is a massive gap in terms of competitiveness between the German economy and the Mediterranean economies. If we carry on down this route of saving the euro, we will probably finish up with violent revolution in those southern Mediterranean states. So I would say that it would be better, if we were good Europeans, to break up the euro zone and recognise that Greece, Spain and Portugal should never have joined in the first place. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, when I first starting standing up in this place and saying that I thought the euro project was flawed and would end very badly, I was met with a wall of derision in this House, and I must admit it was a very lonely old game. But now there is a growing number of people here who recognise the flaws in the euro project, and out in Europe roughly half the population of the EU and the euro zone now regret going into the currency.  But I was pleased to see this week that an even bigger voice is now being heard amongst the experts in the financial community. The Danish Bank – Saxo Bank – said that the euro zone leaders are behaving like drug addicts and alcoholics. And how right Saxo Bank are, because you keep on taking that same drug that is doing you and the peoples of Europe so much damage. It is time for some recognition. The Mediterranean states do not fit into the euro zone, and if this summit pushes on towards banking and fiscal union, it will not help anybody: it is going to break up in the end. Nigel Farage  (EFD
). -  
Mr President, it is received wisdom here that all the economic problems in the European Union, and in particular the shambles of the euro zone, are all caused by the Anglo-Saxon capital markets and therefore they must be attacked. That is what the financial transaction tax is really all about. And it says two things to me.  Firstly, this unilateral approach on financial transaction tax, on global warming policy, on all of these things, is rendering Europe the low-growth economic disaster zone of the world. This is a self-inflicted wound. These countries that are doing it are damaging their ability to do this business.  Secondly, even though the British Government sensibly are not going along with this, the very fact that this was proposed and that over two thirds of the tax would have been raised from the City of London, tells me we should not be in this club at all. It was put in place to damage financial markets and in particular to damage Britain. It is a bad idea for us and it is a bad idea for you too. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Prime Minister Cameron heads to Brussels tomorrow – I think, on ‘Mission Impossible’ – but it is a remarkable debate, in that the European Union is talking about taking another trillion euros from European taxpayers, despite the fact that the accounts have not been signed off for 18 years in a row. If this was a company, the directors, in this case the Commission, would all be in prison. But never mind; Mr Cameron will go and he will argue for a freeze, or what he means by a freeze, which is the same over-bloated budget with increases for inflation. And that actually is the very best that he can achieve in these negotiations. I have no doubt that, when he comes home, the UK taxpayer will have an even bigger bill. This will not work because the public mood in Britain is now very clear: what our taxpayers are saying is that enough is enough. No longer do we wish to pay money to Hungarian companies involved in projects that improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs. And our patience has completely snapped at such cultural absurdities as the EUR 400 000 given to the Flying Gorillas dance troupe who, using their own language of ‘rhythm, music and gibberish’ – they would fit in well here, would they not? – give performances such as the brilliant Smelly Foot dance, with an acoustic score that includes some ‘spectacular belching’. No, I am not making it up. I think the British public are angry at the fleets of chauffeur-driven cars, at the extravagant buildings and the never-ending travelling circus that is the European Parliament. We pay GBP 53 million a day to be a member of this organisation for no benefit whatsoever. Mr Cameron, when you come back from this Brussels summit, why do you not accept my challenge and let us have a proper full debate on Britain and whether it is worth staying a member of this Union or not. The last opinion polls over the weekend show that, by a majority of two to one, the British people now want us to leave this Union and not to pay you a penny piece.

– There is a parliamentary tradition of MPs entering assemblies but wishing to use their position in the interests of secession. We saw it with the Irish nationalists in the 19th century. Indeed, Sinn Fein run for elections to the UK Parliament, and the Scottish National Party sit in the UK Parliament. We came here because we felt that the British public were not being told what was happening in Europe and how much it was costing. We have used our position here to try to get that information back to the British public. Given that now, by a majority of two to one, the Brits want to leave this Union, I would say that we are doing a pretty good job. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, what we have seen this morning from the Commission and Parliament is a passionate defence of high salaries, index-linked pensions, chauffeur-driven cars and a lifestyle that none of you would actually enjoy out there in the real competitive world. It is the status quo: convincing itself that it you are doing a good job despite the fact that the public increasingly doubt you. I would remind you that every time taxpayers’ money is thrown at common European projects the results are less than a success. The common fisheries policy and its environmental degradation and now of course the euro are not just an economic but a social disaster which is engulfing the Mediterranean and it is all based on flawed thinking that the State if it has power and money can create wealth. The dead hand of bureaucracy is destroying innovation and destroying jobs in Europe. National democracy and free markets would be a much better model. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President: Mr Van Rompuy, when you first appeared here, in what proved to be a rather expensive speech I said you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy – and sure enough, in your dull and technocratic way, you have gone about your course. But I have to say you are even worse than I thought you were going to be. I thought it was just going to be a federal Europe – a federal Union – but actually it appears, with every statement you make, that what you now want is the total subjugation of states to completely undemocratic structures based in Brussels. I misread the bailouts. I thought that when the bailouts happened and I could see the panic around this Chamber, with people fearing economic meltdown... But you, of course, were calm through it all, because you saw the bailouts as your opportunity to take control. Just think how Ireland today has managed, and Greece, for that matter. The sinister-sounding troika come in, 50 officials spend a few days in the country, investigate the situation and then tell puppet prime ministers what they may or may not do. I note great enthusiasm in this Chamber for Spain to have a bailout: lots of Members here want Spain to accept the bailout, so that they too are subjugated to this new order. Indeed in Italy, the appointee there, Mr Monti, is very keen for his own country to be bailed out because, to quote him, he fears that parliamentary democracy could bring down the European Union. It is pretty clear that your next phase is for those that have not been bailed out and may not need to be bailed out. You now want them to sign budget guarantees and to have the power to strike down national budgets after they have been through parliaments. I have to say I feel that the eurozone is now in a very dark place economically, socially and politically, and I fear that the countries trapped inside it, in that prison, will be there for many years to come. So it is odd that, against this backdrop, the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the European Union. It is true that Germany has not invaded France since 1945, but I do not think there is any prospect of that happening – unless what you are all saying is that the Germans are inherently bad people. No, the threat actually came from Russia, and we should be thanking NATO and millions of American soldiers who served on European soil to maintain peace. Yet I do not hear a word of that, because we loathe America and everything that it stands for. No, this is now a divided, split Europe, with neo-Nazi politics on the rise and violent demonstrations in the streets. Frankly, I think that the award of that Nobel Prize devalues that whole organisation. It is not all bad news, because in Britain the opinion polls are clear that a clear, settled majority of Brits now want to leave this Union, leaving David Cameron as piggy in the middle, trying to pretend to be a Eurosceptic when he comes over here, going back home and claiming victories – but he is stuck. I predict one thing: big political change is coming in Britain, because he is losing the support of millions of his own voters. William (The Earl of) Dartmouth and Nigel Farage  (EFD

 The EU has a vindictive, neocolonialist trade and aid policy towards the world’s poorest countries. It refuses to trade on fair terms with them, and has a desire to bully them economically. Much of the poverty and insecurity in the world’s poorest countries was created by the EU in the first place. Outside of the EU, the UK could pursue policies that genuinely help. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, I begin today on a happy note remembering that it is 20 years ago this very week since the United Kingdom, having been signed up by the Conservative Government to the Exchange Rate Mechanism, broke out of the ERM. It was a great liberation for us and, of course, once having been bitten we did not join the euro project, thank goodness. Sadly, the same is not true for much of the rest of Europe. I thought, through the last 18 months or so, that the economic logic of why Britain left the ERM would apply, particularly to those Mediterranean countries, and I foresaw that actually those countries would leave the euro zone, probably with Greece leaving this year. But I now have to accept that I have been wrong about that, because I had totally underestimated the complete fanaticism of you, Mr Barroso, your college of Commissioners, and the European Central Bank. You have come out fighting on all fronts. Today you announced that there is going to be a banking union, yet more centralised control, yet more regulation. You make it clear that whilst you think the nation state should continue to exist, it must not have any democratic powers. All democracy is to be vested here under what you call the ‘Community method’ which of course means that your unelected Commission has the sole right to present that legislation, so I do not believe you when you say that and I find the tone of much of what has been said and done over the last few days really very worrying. Mario Draghi, now known by some that believe in the euro as Super Mario, showed us his big bazooka the other day. He upped the stakes and he told us – and to me it is an odd concept – that he had unlimited money. Now, I do not think money grows on trees and I think that money is limited to what the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayers are prepared to put in, but he has made clear his intention: he will fight to the last German taxpayer to keep the Mediterranean countries that should never have joined the euro in there. And now you have of course the Prime Minister of Italy – perhaps we ought to call him Monstrous Mario – who made it clear last week that he feared that nation state democracy could bring down the European Union and therefore we have to by-pass nation state democracy and pass all the powers here. Your henchman Olli Rehn, who is here today, dares to tell countries when they should and should not have general elections. He is urging Spain to accept a full bailout so that they too are trapped in the euro prison. I have to accept that you now have the whip hand over the citizens of Europe and I now think that this euro crisis will go on for a whole miserable decade. In the end, you will have to face the reality that even France and Germany cannot survive together in the same economic and monetary union and certainly with President Hollande reducing retirement ages, upping minimum wages and bringing in a hate tax for the successful, which will see all the entrepreneurs leave France, I am afraid that gap will get bigger. I wonder where the hope comes for those who believe in nation state democracy. We have heard that the German court this morning has decided that the ESM is OK. Maybe the Finns will say they have had enough. Maybe the Germans as a country will say they are no longer going to go on feeling ashamed and guilty for what their grandparents’ generation did and will start to stand up for their own economic interest. I do not know, but I suspect that the best hope we have actually comes from the United Kingdom, where the demand for a referendum is stronger than it has ever been, where our Conservative Prime Minister is in very deep trouble. I think today, Mr Barroso, the British people hearing you calling for the European Union to become a global power, making it absolutely clear that Member States must obey what you tell them, whether they are in the relatively wealthy north or the poorer south, I think those comments, this emerging, creeping, Euro-dictatorship is something that will repulse millions of British people. The only good news I take from today is that you have helped to bring that referendum just a little bit closer. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I think the point about listening is a very good one – a very good one. You should have listened when the French people voted ‘No’ to the European constitution, but you chose to ignore them. You should have listened when the Dutch by a massive majority of two to one said ‘No’ to the constitution, but you did not. You rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty without conceding a single power; you bulldozed it through, and here this morning we hear talk of a new treaty and a new constitution. When little Ireland not once but twice dared to vote ‘No’ in a referendum on European integration, you did not listen, you bullied them to make them vote again. You are the one, Sir, who is not listening. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– 
Mr President, Mr Barroso claims to be a good democrat. It is a very twisted form of democracy when he says that all of those political parties that get votes with which you do not agree are not relevant. It is a pretty obscene definition of democracy to decry those of us that believe in national democracy and European cooperation. Mr Barroso calls us populists, extremists, xenophobic and nationalistic. Surely Mr Barroso, the point about democracy is that you engage in debate. You listen to what the other person has to say, you put it to the public and you accept the result. That is what real, genuine parliamentary democracy is about, and you seem to actually despise that and everything that those of us that stand for national democracy believe in. And to tell me that you are in this position because this Parliament voted for you! We were only given the chance to vote for one candidate! Is that your new model of European democracy?

 I think I had better be slightly careful how I answer the last part of that question. Mr Brok, the British Prime Minister is taken from the floor of the House of Commons and in fact nearly the entire British Government are elected Members of that House of Commons. That is the Government of the United Kingdom. The fundamental difference between that and the European Union is that this College of Commissioners that you see over here – the people who have the sole right to propose legislation with the European system – not one of them has been voted for by anybody in Europe and therefore they cannot be removed. That is why the European system is not just undemocratic, it is anti-democratic. Nigel Farage  (EFD

Mr President, under the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament, if you, as the President, wish to enter into a debate, that is fine. You are allowed to do so but you first have to leave the Chair. I would suggest what you just did was to enter into that debate from the Chair, and that is not the way this, or any other Chamber, should be conducted. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, that is the 19th crisis summit that Mr Cameron has been to. As the Rolling Stones might say, the 19th nervous breakdown, and that is reflected I think by the funereal mood in this Chamber this morning. Yes, on that Friday morning ‘breakthrough’ was cried, and indeed Mr Van Rompuy parroted the word this morning: ‘breakthrough’. Nobody believes you. The wheels are coming off. This European Stability Mechanism, your new bailout vehicle, is doomed before it starts. We have legal challenges in Ireland and in Germany. We have the Estonian Justice Minister saying it will not fit their constitution but – most fun of all – the Finns and the Dutch seem to have broken the agreement that was made in the middle of the night. Perhaps they were excluded from this, perhaps the little countries do not have a say in Europe at all any more. It is not credible. The euro crisis now looks to me to be frankly insoluble. There is also a massive crisis of leadership. It is lovely to see you, Mr Van Rompuy. You have not been here for many months; it is delightful to have you back. Last time you were here, you told us we had turned the corner, that the worst of the crisis was over. With every one of your predictions, it goes on getting worse. I am sorry, sir: you do not have the presence, the credibility or the standing for the international markets to believe that you can provide a solution. And Mr Barroso here: at the G20, he stood up at the press conference and said that we do not need any lessons in democracy – said the unelected President of the European Commission. I mean, he went on to say that the eurozone’s problems had been caused by unorthodox practices in North America. You have made yourselves an international laughing stock. You do not have any credibility. But one piece of helpful advice from me: do not this summer go on any billionaires’ yachts on extended holidays, because the markets guarantee we will all be back here in August. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, another one bites the dust. Country No 4, Spain, gets bailed out, and we all of course know that it will not be the last. However, I wondered over the weekend whether perhaps I was missing something, because the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rajoy, said that this bailout shows what a success the eurozone has been. I thought, well, having listened to him over the previous couple of weeks telling us there would not be a bailout, I have the feeling, after all his twists and turns, that he is just about the most incompetent leader in the whole of Europe – and that is saying something because there is pretty stiff competition! Indeed, every single prediction of yours, Mr Barroso, has been wrong, and dear old Herman Van Rompuy, well, he has done a runner has he not? The last time he was here, he told us we had turned the corner and that the euro crisis was over; he has not bothered to come back and see us since. I remember being here 10 years ago and listening to the launch of the Lisbon Agenda. We were told that with the euro, by 2010, we would have full employment and, indeed, that Europe would be the competitive and dynamic powerhouse of the world. By any objective criteria, the euro has failed and, in fact, there is a looming impending disaster. This deal makes things worse, not better. EUR 100 billion is being put up for the Spanish banking system and 20% of that money has to come from Italy. Under the deal, the Italians have to lend to the Spanish banks at 3%, but to get that money they have to borrow on the markets at 7%. It is genius, is it not! It really is brilliant. So what we are doing with this package is actually driving countries like Italy towards needing to be bailed out themselves. In addition to that, we have put a further 10% on Spanish national debt and I will tell you – and any banking analyst will tell you – that EUR 100 billion will not solve the Spanish problem; it would need to be more like EUR 400 billion. With Greece teetering on the edge of euro withdrawal, the real elephant in the room is that once Greece leaves, the European Central Bank is bust. It is gone. It has EUR 444 billion worth of exposure to the bailed-out countries and to rectify that there will need to be a cash call on Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy! You could not make it up, could you? It is total and utter failure. This ship – the Euro Titanic – has now hit the iceberg and, sadly, there simply are not enough lifeboats. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, we are in the midst of an economic and increasingly humanitarian crisis and yet Commission President Barroso is not here. Indeed, Herman Van Rompuy is not here either, not that it really matters because they are not prepared to listen to any debate or any argument. They are intent on pursuing their political dream of a United States of Europe and are prepared to commit economic suicide for an entire continent. And tomorrow night Mr Van Rompuy has called yet another summit at which he is going to present a strategy for growth and jobs. Elected MEPs, representatives of the people of Europe, from left and right, we have heard it all before. Remember the euro itself was supposed to create growth and jobs and yet it is actively destroying both of those things. The remedy we are being offered is more of the same. I would suggest that the medicine is killing the patient and to increase the dosage is madness. Do not listen to those who will tell you that the only alternative is for Greece to stay in the euro. Everyone is pushing this. David Cameron and all the other leaders are saying that we must keep Greece in the euro; if she leaves, the sky will fall in. It will not. There will be a few difficult weeks and then things will settle down. There will be a boom in tourism. Investment will start to come back into Greece. Innovation will start to come back into Greece as people start making products to beat expensive imports. Indeed, Greece outside the eurozone may well prove to be an inspiration for Spain, for Portugal and for many other countries. We need to recognise that a terrible mistake has been made. We must resolve to put it right. We have got to give people hope because out there now is absolute despair. We all remember Dimitris Christoulas, the 77-year-old former pharmacist who shot himself dead outside the Greek Parliament, but he is just one of a growing humanitarian disaster. There have been huge increases in suicides in Italy and in Greece, particularly by people running small businesses who cannot see a way out of the problem. Children are being left in increasing numbers outside the doors of churches because their parents cannot afford to feed them. Our leaders are too callous to listen and care. You can do something about this. You can rise up and say – and I know from my conversations with you that many of you agree with me – that I am right. We have got to break up the euro. We have got to restore democracy. We have got to restore human dignity. We must ignore Messrs Barroso and Van Rompuy. They have been proved to be wrong. We must provide people with hope.

– Mr President, I would say to Mr Papanikolaou that a reintroduced drachma would probably be 50 to 60% lower than its current value in the euro, something like that. Clearly, I am not advocating that we move to a new fixed peg; I am advocating floating currency rates because history shows us that every time we try to fix currency pegs, we get it wrong. The risk, of course, is that the cost of imports would rise, which is why I said that what it would also lead to is innovation in Greece, as people started to make products to undercut the price of foreign imports. But I tell you what it would give: it would give Greece a chance, because stuck inside the euro you are going to be literally destroyed. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, happy Schuman Day, or Europe Day as you now call it, although I thought the celebrations were rather muted. The only bit of real passion we had was Mr Schulz slagging off the English, but that now appears to be a sort of popular sport in this Parliament. When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I am not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore. I think we are celebrating the wrong day. We should not be celebrating 9 May; we should be celebrating 8 May: Victory in Europe Day. We should celebrate the last time the Germans tried to smash the continent and they foundered and at least half the continent got its democracy back. What we are celebrating on 9 May is another attempt, through different means, to smash democracy across Europe. I do not doubt for a minute that Jean Monnet was well intentioned at the start; he thought that if you abolish nation states, you would stop there ever being another war. He did not, at the time, of course, have the benefit of seeing that theory as it played out in Yugoslavia. But, like Communism, this has all gone badly wrong and the EU Titanic has now hit the iceberg. It is a European Union of economic failure, of mass unemployment, of low growth but, worst of all, it is an EU with the economic prism of the euro and this now poses huge dangers to the continent. We face the prospect of mass civil unrest, possibly even revolution, in some countries that are being driven into total and utter desperation. But there is perhaps an opportunity; there is perhaps some good news. Now a democratic rebellion has begun. It began in Finland last year with the True Finns getting nearly 20% of the vote and we are seeing in country after country new political movements on the Right and on the Left making big scores. But that may not be all good news because what we saw in Greece last Sunday was rather reminiscent of the German election of 1932. We saw the status quo Centre collapse and the extremes of Right and Left rise. You know, this project could even cause the rebirth of National Socialism in Europe. We are headed the wrong way. We must break up the eurozone; we must set those Mediterranean countries free; we must try to build a Europe. I want a Europe, but a Europe based on trade, a Europe based on cooperation, a Europe based on us sitting round the table and agreeing sensible rules on crime and the environment. We can do all of those things but we cannot do them if we are asked to rally behind that flag. I owe no allegiance to that flag and nor do most of the people in Europe either. (Applause from the EFD Group) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, it is a great shame Mr Van Rompuy is not here, because a month ago, he told us that the worst was over and we had reached the turning point; he even told us that he had solved the euro crisis. Today, we have a more realistic Mr Barroso, who says that if we follow his policies and stick together, we can solve this in the end. Sorry, no one believes you anymore, and actually, in the face of the rapidly deteriorating situation, these comments look ridiculous. In Spain, mass unemployment gathers by the day, and internal democracy in Spain is now under threat. In Italy – where we were told Mr Monti would sort it all out – growth figures are falling and the bond spreads are worsening. Now an IMF official has come out and said that it is obvious that at some point a euro break-up will happen. These are big changes: the euro is doomed, and with your policies, Sir – even if Greece accepts the austerity you are imposing on them, and even if, for the next eight years, they obey all this – in 2020, they will still have a debt GDP ratio of 120%, which makes one ask: what is the point? In Spain: if Spain was able to increase ... the difference is, Sir, Britain is not trapped inside the economic prison of the euro. Now take this: if Spain was to increase, if she increased her productivity growth by half a per cent a year (which at the moment looks unlikely), it would take her forty years to close the competitiveness gap with Germany. These countries were sucked in to a totally false economic boom with artificially low interest rates, and they are now paying the price. These policies cannot succeed. Mercifully, outside of this institution, economists the world over now say it is inevitable that the euro will break up; it is just a question of how. I really hope that the IMF now decides to stop pouring good money after bad into these bailouts, and I really do hope that not one penny piece more of British taxpayers’ money goes into propping something up that should be allowed to die.

 My position on the budget of the European Union is very clear: I consider it to be an added tax on the Member States. In particular, the UK is taxed more heavily because it is a net contributor with an increasing contribution. I want to see the budget completely eliminated, with a 10% reduction each year, starting this year. For this reason, I could not support the ECR amendment number 25, which is inadequate as it only calls for a freeze. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I see that Mr Van Rompuy is back for another two-and-a-half years, no doubt a reward for his great success. Indeed, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you, I thought perhaps I had got it all wrong. You talked about how positive the last Council meeting had been, that we have reached the turning point, that everything is going swimmingly, and I was beginning to believe it. And then I realised that you did not mention the D word: Default. No, that cannot be talked about. We pretend there has not been a default when we know, in fact, that in Greece last week, there was a very major credit event. Indeed, listening to all of you this morning reminds me of the great British comedy classic Carry On Up the Khyber
, where the colonial English go on having dinner, ignoring the fact that impending disaster is all around them. You are determined but delusional in this attempt to keep the euro propped up. And whilst you are enjoying your dinner, incoming shells are landing all around you: youth unemployment in Greece went through 50% last week. That is fine, carry on, serve the main course. And you will have seen yesterday that 110 German bondholders of Greek bonds are now going to take legal action against the banks and against the Greek Government. But do not worry chaps; carry on; everything is going to be fine. But perhaps the biggest bombshell is the German Finance Minister saying just yesterday that nobody can exclude a third bail-out. Pass the port. Do enjoy the party. It is a farcical situation, and why is it happening? That is what people in Europe want to know. Why is this happening? Is this being done to help Greece? No. It is going to crucify Greece. It is being done to prop up a failing project because you know that once Greece goes, others will go as well. And some of the language is telling. Mr Barroso, when leaders stand up and say that political moves are irreversible, history has one lesson: you are always, always, going to be proved to be wrong. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the Commissioner picked the right man: puppet Papademos is in place and, as Athens caught fire on Sunday night, he rather took my breath away. He said: ‘violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country’. What democratic country? He is not even a democratically elected Prime Minister. He has been appointed by you guys. Greece is not run through democracy now, it is run through a Troika: three foreign officials who fly into Athens airport and tell the Greeks what they can and cannot do. The violence and destruction that you saw on Sunday is being caused directly because people are having their democratic rights taken from them; what else can they do? If I were a Greek citizen, I would have been out there joining those protests on Sunday; I would be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people. In the puppet’s efforts to get the MPs to vote for the bail-out package, he warned them that if they did not do so, there would be a dramatic decline in living standards. Has he looked outside the front door? Has he seen the fact that 50% of the young people are unemployed already? Has he seen the fact that the economy, far from stalling, has contracted for five years in a row, and is now accelerating on a downward debt spiral, a contraction of 7% per annum? Greece is being driven into the ground, and when it comes to chaos, you ain’t seen nothing yet. These policies are driving Greece towards a revolution. They need to be set free. If they do not get the drachma back, you will be responsible for something truly, truly horrible. (Applause) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP MEPs abstained on this resolution because, although we agree with some elements, we strongly disagree with others, in particular, the imposition of a financial transaction tax.

Mr President, first of all I would like to say: congratulations everybody! David Cameron had you worried for a bit, you even thought he was a Eurosceptic, but it is OK. You have had a quiet word with him and the real David Cameron is back. Whatever happened to the veto? No more vetoes any more. Indeed, Mr Cameron is now actively supporting this quite despicable pact, this plan to destroy and humiliate nation states that do not live up to a Germanic view of how economies ought to be run. I must say I thought the weekend’s proposals from the German finance ministry suggesting that a European Commissioner and his staff occupy a big building in Athens and take over the running of the country – a Gauleiter, some might say – must be joke. Even this EU, I thought, could not possibly sink to those depths – but of course it was just a negotiating position and what we now have for Greece is diplomacy at gunpoint. It is the kind of strategy that Palmerston used against Athens back in the 19th century. Nobody can deny today that Greece is no more than a colony. And this is all a terrible, huge mistake. Greece is not a failing subsidiary company where head office needs to come in and take control. Greece is a nation with a soul, a nation with pride, with history – goodness me, they invented democracy in the first place. They are suffering. They have youth unemployment of 50% caused, Mr Van Rompuy, because they are in the euro. You are causing the misery in these countries and you blather on about creating jobs and growth. None of this is actually going to happen. And remember, these people are being driven into humiliation and desperation. Desperate people do desperate things, and I am deeply fearful for what will happen in Greece if we continue with this mad course. And of course, as Mr Barroso knows, it is going to be Portugal next.

 Mr President, I did not use the word ‘Gauleiter’, I said ‘as some might say’, and indeed the biggest selling Sunday newspaper in Britain used that word. If you want to talk about hatred, just look at what this European project is doing. We have German newspapers slagging off the Italians for being cowards, slagging off the Greeks for being lazy and useless, and we have Italian and Greek newspapers depicting leading figures in Germany wearing Nazi uniforms. Surely the whole point is that this project that was designed to bring us all together in peace and harmony is actually ripping us apart and bringing back nationalisms. And if there was one country I really had a go at in my speech, it was actually the United Kingdom because I admitted the way we behaved towards Greece in the 19th century was not acceptable. Nigel Farage,

 Mr President, there is a very bad case of denial in this Chamber this morning, a total refusal to accept that the euro project is failing. Greece is on the verge of a default. The bail-out fund is creaking. The credibility of the European Central Bank itself is now being called into question. It is all on the verge of going belly-up, and yet when the credit rating agencies tell the truth you try and pretend it is not happening. In fact Mr Brok and others were suggesting that it is all some dastardly plot by the Americans, the British and the Anglo Saxon markets to bring down the euro. The agencies are nothing more than the canary in the mine. They are telling you the truth, so please listen to Standard and Poor’s when they say that austerity alone will not work. You are driving these countries into depression just to save your euro project. But I must acknowledge that you have lost absolutely nothing when it comes to your powers of deception. No, that is still very much on course. It was Nick Clegg who gave us the clue – a man who, I suspect, is rather more popular here than he is back home these days. Clegg was asked whether there should be a referendum on the forthcoming treaty. He said there was no need for that because it was all going to be ‘folded into’ the existing treaties. I thought, ‘What the dickens is he talking about?’ Well, now I have learnt. Mr Cohn-Bendit made it clear: it is to be the ‘Community method’. It is to be legislation where you know you have a majority in this Parliament and you know, under qualified majority in the Council, you can get everything through. Why are you doing it this way? It is simple, is it not? – it is to avoid referendums. Because you know that if a treaty was put to Ireland and many other countries, the answer would be ‘no’. The peoples of Europe do not want this sado-monetarist package. The peoples of Europe, particularly in the case of the South, need to get out of the euro, to have devaluation and a chance to re-establish themselves again. You are denying them that chance and, by pushing the ‘Community method’, you are destroying democracy in Europe. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President – President Schulz – good morning to you. I know it is my job to congratulate you but, given that we knew this result two-and-a-half years ago, as a result of a stitch-up, there really does not seem to be much point. After all, nobody in modern-day Europe would ever have a big, powerful job that was decided upon by a full, open process. I am sure Mr Barroso would agree. I was musing this morning. I was thinking about what kind of President Schulz we were going to get. Are we going to get a dignified, calm figure who behaves like the Speaker of all great parliaments around the world, somebody who puts himself above politics and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day arguments and is an ambassador, indeed a statesman? Or are we going to get the Martin Schulz we have got to know since 2004 as leader of the Socialist Group? You know the one I mean: snarling, angry, unable to control his temper, intolerant of anybody with an alternative point of view, somebody who is contemptuous when, in free referendums, people have the temerity to vote ‘no’, somebody who is anti-British to his fingertips and does not like free markets? I was wondering which one we would get. Well, your opening speech has settled that question for me. It is pretty clear that we are going to have two-and-a-half years of political fanaticism from the Chair. I have to say that only a third-world country, only a banana republic, would want to have an overtly political President of a parliament, but that is what we have got. Mr Schulz, I may represent the smallest group in this Parliament, but I can tell you that it is a group whose ideas and whose views are now being echoed by a growing number of citizens right across this continent. I am sure you would agree that the opinion polls show that it is about 50-50 whether people think this EU is a good thing or a bad thing. What we represent is not anti-Europeanism. That is not what it is about. We believe in nation-state democracy. We want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of cooperation and we want a Europe that is responsible. We do not want a Europe that seeks to be a global superpower. We do not want a Europe run by Mr Barroso and the Commission, and the so-called Community method. I will do my very best to provide political opposition to your Presidency over the next two-and-a-half years and I hope you give us a fair hearing.

– UKIP supports democracy and human rights. However, we feel the EU has no right to lecture other countries on democracy, as it has an unelected president, ignores referendum results that displease it and appoints unelected prime ministers. We do however, feel the accusations of vote rigging in Russia are serious, and would like to see these allegations investigated by a third party. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I have often asked myself the question: why would a successful country that has enjoyed a thousand years of independence give up its right of self-government to the unelected nonentities that we see sitting before us this morning? The answer that comes back from the Foreign Office and the great and the good is that we must have influence in Europe. We must have a seat at the top table and we can change things. We have done our best to prove what good Europeans we are. We go on paying you GBP 50 million a day. We have helped the euro bailout fund, even though we did not join the currency, thank goodness. We have given you 80% of the fish stocks that swim in our waters – your fleets can come and take that from us – and we have applied every directive you have given us absolutely to the letter, all of it to gain influence. In fact, Nick Clegg is so deluded he still thinks we can take the lead in Europe. When a British Prime Minister goes to a summit with a very modest proposal to protect a uniquely important British industry, a snarling President Sarkozy tells him where to go, with German approval of course, and we find ourselves without a friend in the room. Some influence! Well you have decided to head off on the Titanic towards economic and democratic disaster, and we are now in a lifeboat outside the Titanic, but we are threatened by a bow wave that is going to come and engulf us if we are not careful – and it is retribution. We have heard the language of retribution this morning. Financial markets legislation is going to be imposed upon Britain and we will have no influence whatsoever over any of it. Something changed though on Friday. Mr Cameron may not know it, but we are now on course: Britain is going to make the great escape. We are going to get out of this Union. We will be the first European country to get our freedom back. I suspect many others will follow, and then what we will have is our democracy back, our liberty back, and we will have influence in the world as you lot head for disaster. It is going to happen.

Blue-card answer. 
– Mr President, I have to say that that is a very difficult question to answer because there were half of dozen of them thrown in there. David Cameron did what he had to do; he was forced into an impossible position but, you are right, Mr Smyth: he has gained no concessions whatsoever and he has actually now left the United Kingdom even more vulnerable than it was before. We are in a permanent voting minority, we simply have not got a friend in the room, and we have heard this morning that they want to have our rebate, they want financial market legislation. However, he has opened a debate in Britain. The European debate has now started in earnest. Cameron does not know what he has unleashed. I think the momentum for us to have a referendum to divorce ourselves from these failing structures and to replace them with a genuine free trade agreement now has an unstoppable momentum, and that is good for the UK and it is good for Scotland. It will be good for your financial sector based in Edinburgh and will provide many, many jobs for Scottish people. Nigel Farage,

 Madam President, I recently visited Croatia; I wanted to find out whether a proper national debate was going on, whether there was a fair campaign. What did I find? Well I found that the EU is doing everything it can to bribe the political class in Croatia. Doing it quite well too. Already the EU has given EUR 320 million to Croatia in what is called pre-accession aid; the EU has just spent a million euros on a blatant propaganda advertising campaign telling Croatia that the EU is their only hope. Cleverly, you have even given jobs to Croatians – highly paid jobs to Croatians in the European Parliament and in the European Commission – just to show them how well off they – the ruling class – will be if they join. And you have got EU flags flying on official buildings all over the country, to give the impression that it is a done deal. You have some willing helpers because the old Communists are still there in Croatia. They still hold all the positions of power and they will all become personally enormously wealthy if Croatia joins the European Union. There is an even more sinister side to this because there is not a free press in Croatia. There is no national debate going on at all. Indeed a prize has been offered – HRK 10 000 – if anybody can find an article in any Croatian newspaper suggesting that joining is not the right thing to do. The whole campaign is bent, corrupt and distorted. We have seen this before from the European Union, but I think it is happening on a scale in Croatia that is worse than I have seen before. This country has for nearly a thousand years sought independence and for 20 years they have had independence. They got out of the failed political experiment that was Yugoslavia. If they vote to join the European Union, they are voting to rejoin a new Yugoslavia, a failing political experiment that will implode. I hope there is, in the last month or two, a debate in Croatia. Sadly, I doubt it. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, here we are, on the edge of a financial and social disaster, and in the room today we have the four men who were supposed to be responsible. Yet we have listened to the dullest, most technocratic speeches I have ever heard. You are all in denial. By any objective measure, the euro is a failure. Who is actually responsible? Who is in charge out of you lot? Well of course the answer is none of you, because none of you have been elected. None of you actually have any democratic legitimacy for the roles that you currently hold within this crisis. Into this vacuum, albeit reluctantly, has stepped Angela Merkel. We are now living in a German-dominated Europe – something that the European project was actually supposed to stop, and something that those that went before us actually paid a heavy price in blood to prevent. I do not want to live in a German-dominated Europe and nor do the citizens of Europe, but you guys have played a role. When Mr Papandreou got up and used the word ‘referendum’, you, Mr Rehn, described it as ‘a breach of confidence’, and your friends here got together like a pack of hyenas, rounded on Papandreou, and had him removed and replaced by a puppet government. What an absolutely disgusting spectacle that was. And not satisfied with that, you decided that Berlusconi had to go, so he was removed and replaced by Mr Monti – a former European Commissioner, a fellow architect of this euro disaster, and a man who was not even a member of the Parliament. It is getting like an Agatha Christie novel where we are trying to work out who is going to be the next person who is going to be bumped off. The difference is that we know who the villains are. You should all be held accountable for what you have done. You should all be fired. I have to say, Mr Van Rompuy, that 18 months ago when we first met, I was wrong about you. I said that you would be the quiet assassin of nation state democracy, but you are not any more. You are rather noisy about it, are you not? You, an unelected man, went to Italy and said that this is not the time for elections but the time for actions. What, in God’s name, gives you the right to say that to the Italian people?

– Mr President, I am always prepared to accept that I might be wrong and I thought the democratic revolution against this euro lunacy was confined to Northern Europe, but now we see that Slovakia has joined it and I must say what a wonderful result that was last night in Slovakia. I am sure many of you here will agree. It has produced, I think, the quote of the crisis. Richard Sulik, who led the rebels said: ‘I would rather be a pariah in Brussels than have to feel ashamed before my children who would be deeper in debt’. Well I know how he feels because I have been somewhat of a pariah here perhaps for the last 10 years, but he has got it right because he summed up the detachment between Brussels and the real people of the European Union. Listening to this debate today, it is almost as if this debate has been going on inside a padded cell that is the European Parliament, as people compete for who can be the most stupid; who can waste the maximum amount of taxpayers’ money. I really do think as a political class you are all wrong, and you are all wrong democratically because nobody has ever given consent for this behaviour. When people vote ‘no’; when the French vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Dutch vote ‘no’, you ignore them. When the Irish vote ‘no’, you say vote again and get it right. When Slovakia votes ‘no’, we are told today it will all be OK because they can vote again this week until they get the right answer. We have 17 countries trapped inside this economic prison of the eurozone and all you can do, Mr Barroso, is stand up and say: we need more power. People like you – who have been the architect of this failure, the architect of the misery that is being inflicted upon millions – want more power. It is like Barroso in the bunker, unaware of what is happening in the outside world, but planning world domination. In economic terms, it is getting madder and madder. I hear that the new idea is that the bail-out fund will be multiplied, geared up times five, by the European Central Bank so that you have got your two trillion, Mr Verhofstadt. Two trillion – good God! Greece is going bankrupt. If you lot continue, the whole banking system in Europe is going to go bankrupt. The former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, this morning described the attempts to save the euro as the most gigantic Ponzi scheme. I am tempted to think he is right. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. –
 Mr President, Mr Barroso told us this morning that the European Union is an inspiration. Mr Barroso, whilst you admitted to there being one or two little economic problems, you made it perfectly clear that jobs and growth were to follow, that everything is going well. In fact you painted a vision that a new period of European renewal is upon us. As a former Communist yourself you probably remember the old Soviet leaders getting up to give their speeches and telling everybody that there was a record harvest or that tractor production figures were terribly good, and they of course believed that history was on their side. In fact President Khrushchev got up and said to the West: we will bury you. So much did he believe in his own Union. Now of course we look back at that and we laugh. I think that in our tomorrows people will look back at you and they will say: how on earth did this unelected man get all of this power and how did Europe’s political class sitting in this room decide that the Community method should replace national democracy? I think people will look back in astonishment that we have surrendered democracy. But what you want to do is to say, right, we have a European Union and what we have to do now is have more of it. So, as an architect – and you are one of the key architects of the current failure – you say that even though everything to date has been wrong we are going to do more of the same. I thought that was a definition of madness. I cannot believe that this is a rational response to any situation in which you find yourself and, far from it being a State of the Union, I would argue that the Union is in a state because just look at the confusion. We have got you as President of the European Commission, we have a President of the European Parliament; we have got my old friend Herman van Rompuy who is the permanent President of the European Council; we have got the Poles, they are now presidents temporarily of the European Council; we have got presidents all round this room. Goodness me, even I am a President. I am not sure what the collective noun for presidents is, perhaps an incompetence. I do not know. But certainly when you take away democratic accountability it is clear that nobody really is in charge and it is developing as a Union of intolerance. Anybody who stands up here and dares to give a political view which is different from the received wisdom is written off as mad, insane, violent and fascist; we have heard it for years from these people. The intolerance is so deep that, when we get referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland that reject your view, you as a political class see it as a problem to be overcome. So I am very worried about the whole root of this Union. There is a new nationalism that is sweeping Europe. You want to abolish the nation states, in your case, Mr Schulz, perhaps because you are ashamed of your past. And you now want this flag and a new anthem to replace nation states and you do not care how you get there. If you have to crush national democracy, if you have to oppose popular referendums, you just sweep this aside and say that it is populism. But it is not, it is democracy. What is sweeping northern Europe now, starting off in April with that amazing result in the Finnish general election, is a new democratic revolution. It is not anti-European. It wants a Europe of trade; it wants a Europe of cooperation; it wants a Europe where we can do student exchanges and we can work in each others’ capital cities; it wants those things. But it does not want this European Union model. Frankly, you are all now yesterday’s men. (Applause)
 (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, this point is often made, namely that a country like Britain is only 62 million people and are we not better off being part of a big European club so that we can have more of a voice on the world stage? Funny that, is it not? Here is Britain, the world’s fifth largest trading nation, which is now prohibited from going into World Trade Organisation talks because all of that is done, on our behalf, by an unelected European Commissioner. Mr Duff, the answer actually is that an independent Britain that trades and cooperates with her European neighbours in an age of globalisation would be able to forge her own trade relationships across the world. It would make sense for a country like ours to start off with the English-speaking world, which shares common law – our own kith and kin in the Commonwealth who we turned our backs on so shamefully. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Juncker, as President of the Eurogroup, your detachment from reality is almost unbelievable. You are behaving like a political ostrich, pretending none of it is happening. You just told us a few moments ago that Greece fundamentally has no problems because it is a member of the eurozone. I mean, that is just deluded. You wrote recently that the euro’s 13-year history is a success story. Well, it is a very odd kind of success, is it not, and actually saying that frankly beggars belief and I think hardly makes you credible. I think it is about time that you and others in this room woke up to the fact that we are inflicting misery on millions of people through unemployment, through poverty, through a loss of democracy, and that it is an error to try and keep countries trapped inside the euro prison. The recent proposal is that Greece should write down her debts by 50% and remain a member of the eurozone. Surely, Mr Juncker, if that happens, the same would happen to Portugal and Ireland too. Do you think it is possible for any Member State of the euro to write down their debts and stay a member of the eurozone? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group
. – Very good, Mr Juncker, very good. Interesting. On this very point of credibility, you yourself said back in April that, when things become serious, you have to lie. That is what you said back in April. It seems to me that things are pretty serious and that, frankly, everything you say is a lie. The euro cannot, and should not, be held together under its current construction. It is about time that you admitted – you and all of you in this room – that you have got this wrong and countries like Greece need to be set free. (Applause) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. –
 Mr President, there is a new mood in Strasbourg today, and during your speech, Mr Barroso, there was an all pervading sense of gloom. I saw for the first time even your own supporters shaking their heads. They do not believe in what you are saying. The European people do not believe in what you are saying, and I do not really think even you now believe in what you are saying. Because we all know that Greece is going to default. The end game for Greece is near. And you cannot say you were not warned. You were told the Treaties were fatally flawed. You were all told that Greece should never have joined the euro. And when I stood up here five years ago and talked about Greek bond spreads you treated me with such utter derision, it was as if I had been led out of the local lunatic asylum. No, you have been warned all the way through. So now what you have got is economic governance, and everybody here in this front row supports more European economic governance. What is European economic governance? I will tell you what it is: it is a plane landing in Athens airport out of which get an official from the Commission, an official from the European Central Bank and an official from the appalling IMF, and those three people – the troika you call them – go in, they meet the Greek Government and they tell the Greek Government what they may or may not do. You have killed democracy in Greece. You have three part-time overseas dictators that now tell the Greek people what they can and cannot do. It is totally unacceptable. Is it any wonder that Greek people are now burning EU flags and drawing swastikas across them? Frankly, unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and political prison you may well spark a revolution in that country. I suppose there is some good news at least, and that is that in Germany people are waking up; right up to the President people are saying all of this represents the death of democracy. None of this can work, and the German people will simply refuse in the end to pay the bill. Your one achievement is that you have split Europe between north and south. The Greeks now badmouth the Germans; the Germans badmouth the Greeks. I have one last plea, Mr Barroso: will you please help Greece? Help it to get its currency back. Help it to reschedule its debts. Help it out of the mess that you have put it into. Your policies have failed. Stand up, be a man, admit it. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD
). - 
 Mr President, the Member is quite right. London has had some huge social problems, but they are not there today. The difference is that in Greece these protests go on day after day. I put it to you that if you rob people of the most powerful thing they possess in a free society, their ability to vote for and to fire their governments and their ability to be the masters of their own destiny, all they are left with is civil disobedience and violence. So what you are doing in the name of economic governance is something which is incredibly dangerous. Far from this European project being something that will engender peace, it is likely to do the very opposite. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, in replying to Mr Tusk, having listened to his words this morning, I have to ask him this. In an age when the gap between ordinary voters and the European political class grows wider by the day, just what planet are you on? Why the pretence that everything is going incredibly well? The EU is mired in deep structural crisis. Greece, Portugal and Ireland cannot survive inside the euro. The Danes have torn up the Schengen agreement, and good for them, because the total free movement of peoples is a completely irresponsible thing to have done. Public opinion is saying that, whilst they want a European cooperation – yes, of course I agree with that – what they do not want is this Europe, run by unelected bureaucrats like Mr Barroso. You say the EU is fantastic in a recent comment. You are supporting the destruction of national democracy. But it is with reference to Greece that I am most concerned about you because, when faced with their recent enslavement, you said: ‘we lived for many years as a non-sovereign country, under Soviet occupation. For us, European integration is not a threat to sovereignty because we experienced not long ago a serious threat to our sovereignty’. So what are you saying? That this is not quite as bad as the USSR? Is that really good enough for your people? And today you describe Greece’s problems as trivial. I am sorry; there are hundreds of thousands of people out there on the streets of Greece fighting to get their democracy back. It beggars belief that you and our President, Mr Buzek, can talk about the Solidarity movement, about Poland getting its democracy back 20 years ago. Yet here you are, surrendering the democracy and sovereignty of Poland to a failed European Union. Yes, sir. We all want a shared European cooperation for the future, but this most definitely is not the model. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Mr Goebbels, post-1945, there were some very sensible ideas put together, namely, the Council of Europe. Let us have a Europe where we sit down together, where we have a free trade agreement and where we agree minimum standards on work and on the environment. We can do all of these things without a European Commission, without a European Parliament and without a European Court of Justice. We have done it in security terms with NATO. Yes, it will mean you will lose your job, Mr Barroso. But, apart from that, why can we not do things as mature democracies? Yes, Mr Schulz, I want you sacked as well – I want you all fired! We can do these things, and that is a positive way forward. By taking away from people their ability to govern themselves and transferring that power to the European Commission, we are headed for a Europe of rebellion and violence. Let us take the democratic route. (Mixed reactions) Nigel Farage  (EFD

– 1. We have previously voted against the following legislation, which removes our right to control our own food labelling. We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 – which prevents us labelling our own products as, for example, ‘Welsh beef’ and ‘Cheddar cheese’, without EU permission. 2. Further, it also gives the Commission unspecified powers to apply delegated acts in the future, thus changing the legislation in a manner which they choose, without reference to the EP members or any voting process in the EP. 3. We also have previously voted against the following legislation, which removes our right to control our own food labelling. We do not support this existing legislation and do not confirm it in this vote: Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 on protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs, which even removes our power to freely designate a product as ‘English’ or ‘Welsh’ or ‘Scottish’: Article 2, section b: “ ‘geographical indication’ means the name of a region, a specific place or, in exceptional cases, a country ...”.

 Mr Orbán, you are one of the few European leaders who has a grasp of history, believes in the nation state and champions democracy. I would say Hungary is lucky to have you. You have shown you are not prepared to be bullied by these EU nationalists. When you say that previously Hungary was dictated to by Moscow, and now it is Brussels, and you say that you are going to stand up to it, you actually mean it. So I think you have proved to be the secret weapon of the Eurosceptic movement. Your six-month tenure in this presidency has indeed been historic, because in the last six months the peoples of Europe have finally woken up to what a completely undemocratic and failing project this is. There have been some real highlights in your six months. In particular, one thinks back to the Finnish general election and the stunning success of the True Finns party. Who can blame ordinary taxpaying voters, in Finland or elsewhere, for saying that they do not want to go on bailing out this failed project called the euro? Well, hard on the heels of the Finnish result we had the third catastrophe, the third casualty; Mr Barroso’s own Portugal needed to be bailed out. Then of course we were back to Greece for the second bail-out, with people out rioting on the streets. But perhaps to cap it all, the real highlight of your presidency was that the Danes tore up the Schengen Agreement. So, all in all, I would say that you have had a remarkable, superb six months in office. More has happened to reawaken democracy and the future of the nation state perhaps than ever before. I think there is a growing realisation, both here and elsewhere, that the worm has turned, and we have seen the beginning of the end of this extremely dangerous project. Mr Orbán, jolly well done!

 These two amendments (10 and 11) were supported to stop a cap or ceiling being introduced for direct payments. The effect of such a cap would be to create an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare as landowners sought to divide up large holdings to avoid the ceiling cutting their money: it represents the very worst sort of bureaucratic perverse incentive for questionable but probably legal behaviour.

 Mr President, every time I ask Mr Barroso what his Plan B is, he says there is no need for one. Mr Barroso, every time I predict that another country is on the verge of a bail-out you say, ‘no no, there is no problem’. Here we are, on the verge of the second Greek bail-out, and you say, ‘there is no alternative’. We must continue down this route. We must ignore the fact that the Spanish bond market is telling us that they are going to be next. What a fine mess you have got us into. You have a 100% record for being wrong with every single prediction about the euro and you say today that this package will put Greece on the road to growth, but no it won’t. It will put Greece on the road to a third bail-out, which we will be discussing in a just a few months’ time. I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package. They have to accept cutting their economy to a level that will put them in total economic depression. They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy. They are on the streets and there is violence, and frankly this can only get worse. You have stripped them not just of money; you have stripped them of their democracy. What good Europeans, really good Europeans, would do, is provide an alternative to help the Greeks re-establish their own currency, to allow them to devalue, to let them renegotiate their debts, because their debt-to-GDP ratio has passed the point of no return. Then, and only then, can real austerity packages work. Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts. If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD

 Mr President, the United Kingdom went through this exactly twenty years ago. We were part of the exchange rate mechanism. We were trapped, trying to peg ourselves against the Deutschmark with interest rates that were double what they should have been. It cost 1 million British people their jobs unnecessarily. Mercifully we crashed out of exchange rate mechanism, interest rates came down and we had a happy time during the 1990s. You cannot fuse together different economies with different rates of growth and with different patterns of trade across the world. We learned our lesson. We did not join the euro, thank God. Those who did are, I am afraid, currently trapped inside an economic prison. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro. Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out, you have come back and said, oh no, they don’t, everything is fine. And now we face the fourth bail-out – the second Greek bail-out – unless, of course, today you are going to tell us that is not necessary either. But the question I want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in Greece or Ireland or Portugal to date. It is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks, and which concerns the integrity of the European Central Bank itself. Month after month, I have warned that you cannot go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt. Mr Barroso, do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Backing up some of my rhetoric, just yesterday, the respected think-tank, Open Europe, came out with some figures on this. It said that a staggering EUR 190 billion of the ECB’s exposure is exposure to the Greek state and Greek banks. Should the ECB see the value of its assets fall by just 4.25%, its entire capital base will be wiped out. Do you accept the findings of Open Europe, or do you go along with Mr Juncker’s assertion a couple of weeks ago that, with the situation in the euro being as serious as it is, you actually have to lie in public? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I would like to say to Commissioner Rehn that I have been looking at the IMF Charter. There is nothing here that will surprise you; it is there to promote balance, growth, exchange rate stability, to lessen disequilibrium and to help countries that are in trouble. The classic method uses is to shore up the finances and organise a competitive devaluation. Nowhere in here does it say that the IMF is there to support political experiments and, in so many ways, that is what Dominique Strauss-Kahn did. He used the IMF to help bail out the failing euro project and, as such, he was a very poor choice of candidate. Now you want to compound that by approving Christine Lagarde – another member of the European political elite, another euro fanatic, somebody else who believes in propping up this euro project – and I would have thought that, as she has got a vested interest, she is, in fact, a highly unsuitable candidate. It is as if the EU has hijacked the IMF, that it is now there as part of the support mechanism for the euro, so that it is not just the taxpayers of the eurozone and the non-eurozone EU members, but the whole world that now has to help prop up the euro as the Greek problem compounds by the day. Well, I suppose in some ways, you may well need Mrs Lagarde because not only is Greece going bust, not only are we heading for the fourth bail-out, but as I have warned before in this Assembly, the validity of the European Central Bank itself will very shortly be called into question. I have warned that you cannot go on buying your own bad debt, but we have reached the point where, within weeks, we may well see that the ECB itself is not solvent, so perhaps your friend Mrs Lagarde can help bail that out as well. I would have thought this is a very poor choice. The international community at some point will tell you where to get off – perhaps not just quite yet. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, yesterday indeed was Europe Day and in the courtyard here we had armed soldiers, we had the Luftwaffe band and imperial eagles, we had the flag being paraded, being raised, the European anthem; it was the display of militarism and EU nationalism. I thought and hoped it was all just a bad dream, but today we have got you, Mr Barroso. You begin of course by reiterating the fact that the free movement of peoples is the embodiment of the European project. You then go on to say that it is the duty of Member States to share the burdens of migratory flows into Europe. You advocate a common EU immigration policy, but of course you know that you are losing because the row that has blown up between Italy and France shows that when there is a crisis, between the theory of European integration and the practicality of nation state, it is the nation state that wins. So you are worried that you are losing and, in your defence of your position, in your defence of your beloved acquis communautaire, your body of law, you resort to intolerance, you resort to nationalism, you make me realise that what I saw yesterday was actually for real. You attack those who want to control their own border policies. You attack them today as xenophobes. You attack them as extremists, but worst of all, oh worst of all, you attack them three times for being populists. Is that not a dreadful thing? The power of the ballot box. When people dare to vote no in referendums, they are populists; when they want to control their own borders, they are populists. I put it to you that populists are actually democrats and you abuse those who want to fly the flag of populism. Well, here it is, Mr Barroso. Here it is. (Mr Farage, Mr Agnew and Mr Bloom held up small Union Jacks)
 That flag has represented liberal democracy far more than any other Member State of this European Union and it will go on long after your star-spangled banner has disappeared. Nigel Farage  (EFD

– Madam President, under Rule 110 of our Rules of Procedure, the Commission may, at any time, request permission to make a statement on an urgent issue. Overnight, we have had the economically calamitous, but unsurprising, news that another country has bitten the dust and that Portugal is going to have to be bailed out. Can I ask whether you have received any request from the Commission to make a statement on Portugal today? If not, would the Commissioner say why not? Does he think that the bailing-out of Portugal is not important enough for this Parliament to discuss, or is he just burying his head in the sand? Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I ask: is the answer yes or no? Have you received a request from the Commission to make an urgent statement on the Portuguese situation or not? John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments to this report. This was not due to indifference on our part; rather, it is because this report is a development of the Common Immigration and Asylum Policy under the Lisbon Treaty. The peoples of Europe do not want the Lisbon Treaty or a Common Immigration and Asylum Policy either, which is why they were denied a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. To vote on the amendments would have entailed endorsing existing EU legislation (which we don’t want either) and a nit-picking exercise in order to decide which bits were worse than others. Therefore, UKIP MEPs abstained on the amendments, but voted a resounding ‘No’ to the report as a whole. John Bufton, David Campbell Bannerman, Derek Roland Clark and Nigel Farage  (EFD
),  
in writing. 
– UKIP is, in principle, against European political parties. They are a waste of hard-pressed taxpayers’ money. There is no need for them, and the authentic way of representing the opinion of the peoples of the Member States remains the national political party. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that UKIP reserves the right to participate in a European political party so that it, too, might benefit from those taxpayers’ money, the better to represent the many millions of Britons and other people across the continent who oppose the European Union and all its works and whose voice is stifled by the ruling political class.

 Mr Barroso, I am confused. Help me. What is the EU’s policy on Libya? I got a letter on 1 April from the noble Baroness Ashton telling me that the EU had provided more than EUR 75 million in humanitarian assistance and that, although the situation remains uncertain, the EU has offered to assist in fostering dialogue. Yet she wrote this many days after the bombing had begun. That is what she has been saying. On the other hand, we have got hard man Herman Van Rompuy, who has made it clear that regime change is the aim of this Libyan adventure. He also said that the action in Libya could not have happened without the European Union, and that France and Germany could not have taken military action without first getting the support of the European Council. So we have two big chiefs within the European Union directly contradicting each other. Could you please shed some light on the matter, and tell us what is the European Union’s policy on Gaddafi and Libya? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group

 Well there is certainly a broad range of opinions here. I wonder whether Mr Barroso would agree with me that appointing as Head of your new Foreign Office and in charge of external security a woman who has been an extreme left-wing, life-long passivist, the former treasurer of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, somebody who has proved to be incompetent in the job, was not in fact one of the better decisions of the European Union. I can only say thank God for Baroness Ashton, without her I suspect all of us would be very much deeper into Libya. Nigel Farage  (EFD

 I voted against the Balzani report on General guidelines for the preparation of 2012 budget because it believes that the Europe 2020 Strategy will pull Europe out of the economic downturn, when what the nations of Europe really need is to be freed from the dead hand of EU overregulation and overtaxation. This 2020 Strategy is not a cure for the problems of the economies. In addition the report threatens with the prejudice a reduction of the budget would have on European solidarity and economic development. The European budget has become an expensive luxury that the citizens and taxpayers of Europe cannot afford. Calling for a small increase or a freeze is derisory when what is really needed is a sharp cut in the budget to give the taxpayer a break. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Madam President, I enjoyed Mr Barroso’s view of the world today, but it was perhaps rather more ironic than he had intended. He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere, saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy. I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then, if you do not like what they do, you can get rid of them, turf them out and put somebody else in. It was ironic because his next sentence was ‘and that is why in Europe, facing the euro crisis, we must reinforce the Community method’. For the public watching in on this – which increasingly they do – the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats – people like you, Mr Barroso. I know the European Parliament voted for you, but you were the only candidate that was offered to us. That is not democracy! So Mr Barroso is saying, on the one hand, that democracy is good, but on the other hand, that we cannot have it in Europe. That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt, who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished – well, perhaps his own will be very shortly. He is saying that we want an economic union. Nobody has voted for that. Nobody has been asked whether they want it. He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it. What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal. After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland, it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message – ‘Come in number 3, your time is up’. Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6% on Monday. Mr Barroso knows that himself. It was when yields reached 7% that Ireland had to be bailed out. In April, we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt – another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over. Let us remind ourselves that, in the last six months, 80% of Portugal’s debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank. We cannot go on as a European Union buying our own debt. If we do, the next debt crisis will not be in a country, but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, I am pleased that Mr Schulz has asked me that. The difficulty is that when you form an artificial state that has within it more than one language group – which is clearly the case in Belgium – you may, for a period of time, be able to hold it together, but whether it is Belgium, whether it is Yugoslavia or whether it is the European Union, if you have entirely different languages and cultures, it will not hold together. The reason you are so upset about Belgium, and Mr Van Rompuy got terribly upset about it and Mr Verhofstadt never likes it, is that – is this not the truth, Mr Schulz? – Belgium is a microcosm for the whole European project. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Madam President, that is a good question. Mr Schulz, you are quite right that Belgium was a British invention, and a British mistake. We have made many over the years. We have got some things right and some things wrong, just as your country, Germany, has. Germany’s history has not been whiter than white, I think you might agree. You are quite right. Actually, holding together the United Kingdom has been something that has been deeply troubling. Indeed, Ireland went its own way, back in 1921, I think, when independence for Ireland was established. You are right. It is very difficult to hold together different cultures. I do think that the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland works, at the moment, because it has consent. If it did not have consent, then there would be popular calls for referenda and those nations would be able to break away. But my point is that in this European Union, nobody is being given that opportunity. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, the theory of a Tobin tax has been around for years – the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange – but, of course, it has never seen the light of day. What is being proposed here – and, of course, it is because the European Union is so desperate for money and is in so much trouble that it needs its own resources – is to use an opportunity to bash the financial sector because they are very unpopular at the moment and to introduce a financial transaction tax just in the European Union, as if somehow that will gain us great revenue. I am sorry, but we are living in a global economy. If we become uncompetitive through tax or regulation, people simply move – and they can do so in the space of 24 hours. To do this would be to pursue kamikaze economics. The biggest foreign exchange market in the world – the biggest financial sector in the world – is in London. If I did not know better, I would think perhaps there was a plot afoot here to stop the Anglo-Saxons going on doing all of their business. In 2010, as a result of the AIFM Directive, one in four hedge funds left the City of London. If we continue down this route, Britain will have lost its biggest single industry. I think the time has come when the City of London and Britain’s financial markets are going to rise up against membership of this European Union. Maybe, if we vote for this tomorrow, it will be so bad that it will be really rather a good thing for UKIP and our view that we should not be part of this massive socialist experiment.

 We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that: 1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers; 2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service. The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK. We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception. Nigel Farage,

– Mr President, what is the most commonly used word in association with the euro? No, it is not ‘failure’ – although it could be. It is ‘stability’, is it not? A decade ago, everybody said that once we had the euro currency, it would bring us stability. Well, a decade on, I would suggest that what it has brought is chaos, discord and misery for millions, and yet the word ‘stability’ is still being used this morning. Mr Barroso used it, Mr Van Rompuy used it: ‘stability’. In fact, we are patting ourselves on the back because the bond auctions in Portugal went well last week, whereas the reality is that the European Central Bank was actually using taxpayers’ money to buy their own debt. Your reassurances that all is well do not work. Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Van Rompuy? Bond yields in Portugal rose to nearly 7% yesterday. The public right across the Union no longer supports the currency, and the battle for Spain has not even begun. The model itself is failing and yet what you want is to double the size of the bail-out fund. You even want to increase the scope of the bail-out fund so that, along with the ECB, you, too, can go on buying yet more of your own debt. You are using the crisis as a massive power grab to take us towards fiscal union. If you succeed, then we should change the name: get rid of ‘European Union’ and call it the ‘Debt Union’. If you do succeed, you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison, in which people’s suffering will be untold, while the northern countries will find themselves paying, forever, a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies. We have reached a point where it actually does not matter what any of you say. Nobody believes you. The public does not support you. I hope and pray the markets break you. Nigel Farage  (EFD
).  
– Mr President, I did say a decade ago that you could not have Greece and Germany put together in the same monetary union and that it would not work. If you go back through history, you find that when people are put together in false currency unions, when governments think they know better than the markets, governments always lose. You ask me what my solution is today. It is absolutely as plain as a pikestaff. Greece, Portugal and Ireland do not fit inside the euro. What we should be doing, what Mr Van Rompuy should be doing in order to give real leadership, is to be introducing a plan B and to allow these countries to go back to their own currency, to have competitive devaluations and to have a chance, because what we are doing with this policy is killing them off. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, I welcome Mr Orbán. After the six months’ farce of the Belgian Presidency, it is nice to see an elected Prime Minister from a proper country. How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology – and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union. Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically, you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union. In fact, you are going to meet lots of Communists over the next six months, including the boss of the Commission here, old Barroso who was an advocate of Chairman Mao! You will see centralised economic planning and control and, above all, what you will see is the desire to impose a political union upon the peoples of Europe without their consent. Wake up Mr Orbán. Look at how they are trying to bully you this morning. They are trying to tell you how to run your own country. Tell them where to go. Stand up and fight for democracy once again. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group.

 Mr President, 2010 will be remembered as the year when the deep flaws in the euro project were exposed and the public in Europe woke up to the sheer stupidity of their leaders. So here we have another summit, another crisis, confidence in the euro ebbing by the week. It is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism. You think that, if you have a fund of say a billion euros, all will be well. Well it will not be well. The failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation. It is nothing to do with the markets, be they currency or bonds, it is because the North and the South in Europe cannot today, or at any point, be put together in a single monetary union. It will not work. And politically, of course, you have to change the treaty. The reason being that the four German professors will win at Karlsruhe and prove that the bail-outs you have put in place already were in fact illegal under the treaties. Well, in many ways I welcome this treaty change because it will mean that there has to be a referendum in Ireland. And you never know, David Cameron might even keep his promise and hold a referendum in the United Kingdom. I am sure that, as democrats, you would all welcome a referendum on the EU in the United Kingdom. We should also reflect at the end of 2010 not just on the state of the Union, but on the state of Belgium. For six months the Belgian Presidency-in-office have sat here telling us we must integrate more deeply. What a farce this is. You have not had a government in your own country since June. Here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation. It truly is an absolute farce but nobody here dares to admit it because you are all in denial. Belgium is a microcosm of the entire European Union. Belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow. Happy Christmas, everybody. David Campbell Bannerman and Nigel Farage  (EFD

– UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern-day version of slavery, and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity. However, UKIP voted against this report as we cannot legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection. This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime, and that is simply not a matter for the EU. It should be up to elected national governments to decide such penalties individually and to work with other countries to help stamp out human trafficking. The EU also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking. As there is freedom of movement within the EU and open borders, along with a single currency, organised crime is allowed to operate much more effectively unchecked. If Member States had proper border controls and checks, this would go a long way to help disrupt the operation of such evil criminal organisations. The EU is actually part of the problem, not the solution. Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr Barroso, the recent WikiLeaks storm has led to mixed feelings, with some people saying transparency is good and others saying perhaps the leaks will damage international diplomacy. However, I was particularly amused by the references to you in WikiLeaks, where it mentioned your trip to Russia and the fact that you were ignored and excluded and the Russian view from upon high that you were nothing more than a glorified international civil servant. Mr Barroso, remember: we have discussed this before here. I have pointed out to you again and again that you have not been directly elected by the people and you therefore have no real legitimacy. Is the fact that you are unelected the reason why you do not command more respect on the global stage, and why increasingly, the peoples of Europe are holding you and the entire Commission in contempt? Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Well, Mr Barroso, I enjoyed that enormously! That you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept I have come across in my entire life. The fact is that the Commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging Europe’s economies in the way that it is. Are there any circumstances in which you think the peoples of Europe should have a referendum so that they can decide these issues? (Interjections from the floor from various Members) Nigel Farage,  
on behalf of the EFD Group. 
– Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy has been in office for one year, and in that time the whole edifice is beginning to crumble. There is chaos. The money is running out. I should thank Mr Van Rompuy. He should perhaps be the pin-up boy of the Eurosceptic movement. But just look around this Chamber this morning, Mr Van Rompuy. Just look at these faces. Look at the fear. Look at the anger. Poor old Barroso here looks like he has seen a ghost. You know, they are beginning to understand that the game is up and yet, in their desperation to preserve their dream, they want to remove any remaining traces of democracy from the system. It is pretty clear that none of you have learned anything. When you yourself, Mr Van Rompuy, say that the euro has brought us stability, I suppose I could applaud you for having a sense of humour. But is this not really just the bunker mentality? Your fanaticism is out in the open. You talked about the fact that it was a lie to believe that the nation state could exist in the 21st
-century globalised world. Well, that may be true in the case of Belgium – which has not had a government for six months – but for the rest of us, right across every Member State in this Union (and perhaps this is why we see the fear in the faces), people are increasingly saying: ‘We don’t want that flag, we don’t want the anthem, we don’t want this political class, we want the whole thing consigned to the dustbin of history’. We had the Greek tragedy earlier on this year, and now we have the situation in Ireland. I know that the stupidity and greed of Irish politicians has a lot to do with this. They should never have joined the euro. They suffered with low interest rates, a false boom and a massive bust. But look at your response to them. What they are being told, as their government is collapsing, is that it would be inappropriate for them to have a general election. In fact, Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget first before they would be allowed to have a general election. Just who the hell do you people think you are? You are very dangerous people indeed. Your obsession with creating this euro-state means that you are happy to destroy democracy. You appear to be happy for millions of people to be unemployed and to be poor. Untold millions must suffer so that your euro-dream can continue. Well it will not work, because it is Portugal next. With their debt levels of 325% of GDP, they are the next ones on the list. After that, I suspect it will be Spain. The bailout for Spain would be seven times the size of Ireland’s, and at that moment, all the bailout money will have gone. There will not be any more. But it is even more serious than economics, because if you rob people of their identity, if you rob them of their democracy, then all they are left with is nationalism and violence. I can only hope and pray that the euro project is destroyed by the markets before that really happens.
