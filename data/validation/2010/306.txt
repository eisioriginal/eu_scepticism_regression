Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament’s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live. In my view, the Council’s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament. Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive. We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored. We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights. The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council. I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last! Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, this is a never-ending story. I have lost count of the times we have discussed it here. It is a shameful situation that it takes an oral question today to elicit information from the Commission about what it plans to do next with regard to data retention. Let me be frank: instead of deluding itself, the Commission should stop playing games and should face up to reality. That includes admitting that data retention has failed.  The Commission’s aim of establishing uniform rules is quite simply misguided. One reason is that some Member States, due to their constitutional arrangements, are not in a position to transpose the European Directive. What’s more, we have a patchwork of arrangements in the other countries which have transposed the Directive. Some countries store data for six months, others for a year. Some only use the data when investigating serious crime; others use the data to investigate minor delictions. It is a terrible mess, and I do not think we have ever seen anything like it. Now you are taking action against the German Government by referring the matter to the European Court of Justice. Curiously, you argue that Germany’s failure to transpose the Directive is likely to have a negative effect on the internal market and on the ability of the German police to investigate and prosecute serious crime. What did you get that from? How did you come up with that? No one can possibly know whether that claim is true. In fact, studies have revealed a very different picture. The available information includes not only the judgments of the courts and related studies. They also include activity reports such as those produced by the German Bundestag’s Research Services, which is genuinely above suspicion. In 2011, the Research Services found no significant evidence that data retention offers any benefits for the investigation of crime. The reports such as that produced by the Max Planck Institute in 2012 are also beyond reproach. That report states that data retention is of no use whatsoever in the investigation of murders, robberies, child pornography and internet crime. Let me say this, Ms Malmström. If the Commission has nothing new to contribute here, you should at least suspend the Directive pending the judgment of the European Court of Justice. Aside from that, we are calling for a Europe-wide ban on the retention of communications data where there is no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, Mr Voss, data retention does not solve any problems. In fact, it is the problem. Let me offer an analogy. Not long ago, I was walking through my home city of Dresden and happened to spot a burglar breaking into a house. Let me ask you this: would you now act on this information by passing a directive which states that women in my age group should stroll through Europe’s cities at night in order to reduce the crime rate? I think we should be asking about the benefits of the Directive. We are nearing the end of this debate and I have just one point to make. Instead of flogging a dead horse – to use your analogy – and filching millions of people’s data, I would suggest that we proceed as follows. Ms Malmström, perhaps you could offer different advice to the Interior Ministers of the EU Member States. You could tell them not to make cuts in the police or law enforcement agencies in their countries. You could tell them to provide decent training for the police and the judiciary and to tackle corruption, which is now widespread. If we manage to achieve that in our countries, we would be making a valuable contribution to combating crime, which would greatly benefit citizens. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, we really ought to speak plainly and clearly today, and this plain-speaking includes the fact that we cannot turn the clock back, and nor do we want to. As Parliament, we have the right under the Treaty to be involved in decisions on all matters relating to Schengen and not just to be casually consulted. That is something that I would like to make clear at the start. I would also like to say that this EU law simply must not be left to the arbitrariness of political freebooters – and that is how I would describe it. Politically motivated contravention – and that is also the term I would choose to use – using the Schengen agreement as a kind of muscle-flexing in election campaigns, is totally unacceptable, and also has nothing to do with EU law. These problems do not only include arbitrary border closures, which we had for a time and which, of course, violate EU law, they also include the installation of cameras at 15 border crossings between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium. If these do not also constitute border controls, then what are they? Furthermore, all that nonsense from a German interior minister concerning the reintroduction of border controls is obviously dangerous. It is dangerous not just because of the problems with Schengen, but also because it represents the arguments of the extreme right, and not just in Germany. Equally unacceptable is the fact that, at the border between Germany and the Czech Republic, which is, incidentally, where I live, buses are constantly being checked. We must not tolerate this. It is not only buses from the Czech Republic that are being checked, but people who look a bit different in some way, for example those who have slightly darker skin, are also being checked. This is also part of the problem. Let us make it very clear that this is not acceptable. We do not want this, because it contravenes the law and because, as Parliament, we do not want this sort of policy. We therefore also express our criticism of the Council’s action in the strongest possible terms. After all, this is not merely a contravention of the law; it is also undemocratic. I therefore suggest that the Council discusses four things with us: Firstly, we ought to be in agreement that there must be no arbitrariness in the way that the Schengen Agreement is implemented. That is something I would like to discuss. Secondly, we want to increase free movement. We want to talk about this. Thirdly, in the event of contraventions of the Schengen Agreement, we want the Commission, with the involvement of the Council, to draw the necessary conclusions. Lastly, as Parliament, we want to be fully involved in all matters, and that includes decision making. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is clear that this is not about individual facts which we have to discuss but about the fundamental issue of our attitude to democracy and civil liberties. When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do. These are the reasons why millions of people have taken to the streets and have long since anticipated the vote on ACTA. There has already been a vote on ACTA on the streets, on the Internet and in relation to the Committee on Petitions in many countries, not only inside but also outside the EU. I believe that we must not ignore this vote. It is a demonstration of direct democracy by the many citizens who elected us. I can only say that we should put ACTA to one side. That is the only decent thing to do. Cornelia Ernst,

 Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, the EU’s open borders represent the most important symbol of the Union around the world, and they have a deep allure to many people across the globe. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as you know, have always criticised the fact that the EU is also associated with fencing off the outside at the same time. That is precisely the reason why it was so important to us to retain a built-in European emergency mechanism, but the Council was up in arms about that idea. I can only say to you that what you are doing here, what you, the Council, are celebrating, is troglodytic. Go back to the basic principles of the Community! I beg you to do that! Put an end to this kind of, ultimately, anti-European politics. Ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Council in this case is anti-democratic, as it seeks to downgrade Parliament to the status of a consulted body. We will not tolerate this, however. We have it in writing, we have a Treaty right to codecision, and we intend to – and will – exercise that right. My second point is that the Council’s decision is deeply anti-European because it nationalises Schengen. I ask you, the Council, the Danish Presidency: do you want to bring back the customs borders? Do you want to go back to the 19th century? What signs are you hoping to send to the outside world with this decision? You are making yourselves look ridiculous to the world, and to Europe. My third point is that this decision by the Council is populist, in the truest sense of the word, and provides a boost to the forces of nationalism, exactly those people who want to retreat to the nations and destroy the Europe that we have built. We cannot settle for that. I appeal to you to take back your decision, and be Europeans again! Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I believe that we are faced with a very sensitive issue when we come to talk about residence restrictions, particularly because this gives a push to right-wing populist and extremist forces. When we see the populist right-wing Swiss People’s Party successfully campaigning for a referendum on the issue of quotas for non-nationals, then we find ourselves on the horns of a dilemma. There is something that I want to state clearly on behalf of our group: neither EU citizens nor anyone else should be allowed to become political footballs or the object of cheap right-wing propaganda as a result of so-called mass immigration, in this case involving Switzerland. The problem is particularly difficult because it relates to European citizens. If we look at who obtains the largest number of residence permits, we find that over two-thirds are EU citizens. In April 2012, the Swiss authorities, in a hasty response, decided to introduce quotas for certain countries. If we take a closer look, we can see a contradiction here: if we consider the breakdown for residence permits as a whole, then we find that most are granted to Germans and Italians, not Czechs or Poles. The proportion of nationals from the eight countries in question is really relatively small and yet the 10 % rule is being invoked, something quite ridiculous in comparison with citizens of other countries. This again shows what happens when one deals with such questions in terms of percentages. You soon find yourself falling into a huge trap, as I would remind you. It is politically dubious and counterproductive for Switzerland to invoke the agreement with the EU, referring to Article 10(4). We see this as a violation of the directive on the freedom of movement and the agreement with Switzerland and, above all, we consider it as discrimination against specific citizens and Member States. That must not be allowed to happen. We need equal treatment for all EU citizens, including in relation to Switzerland. We must be absolutely clear about this. For this reason, we refuse on principle to discuss quotas here, as they actually fan the flames of xenophobia. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, firstly, either there are uniform EU visa rules and a binding reciprocity mechanism for all Member States, in which case the Commission – as Guardian of the Treaties – must fight hard for these to be implemented, or there are not, in which case the Commission has already been tolerating a two-tier system for EU citizens for many years, and my group considers that absolutely unacceptable. We demand that the Commission resolves this problem without delay and prior to concluding the agreement with Canada. Otherwise, the reciprocity mechanism must apply. That is my first point. At the same time, however, we have to take ourselves seriously, which leads me to ask whether the new visa regulation will at least strengthen the reciprocity mechanism? Is that the case? Can we in fact prevent such practices as have occurred in relation to Canada from occurring again in future? The only thing I can say to that is: by no means. What has emerged, however, is that visa policy continues to be used as a means of exerting pressure against migration. As my third point, can we please talk for once about the population group that is often meant when we talk about the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. It is the Roma. Many Roma have gone to Canada, and the Czech Republic argues that Canada is itself to blame for this because Canada has for years created incentives for high levels of immigration through its generous and tolerant asylum policy. That is Canada’s argument, and they are doing nothing to counter this. On the contrary, they go so far as to support it by saying: well, how is it that EU citizens are even able to go to third countries and claim asylum? Indeed, why is that? It is because the Roma have miserable living conditions in the EU – a situation of which we have been aware for many years, in which they are so discriminated against and excluded that it is no wonder that people are going to countries such as Canada. To me, this issue is also a kind of Lex Roma
; and to that extent, if we really want to do something about it, if we want to prevent emigration, then we have to improve conditions at home. That is what we should be looking at. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left intends voting against this agreement because it nullifies an elementary right of EU citizens, namely the right to the protection of personal data. Ms Malmström, I can only shake my head in despair at what you have had to say. You seem to be chasing an imaginary level of security that does not exist and that will not come into existence with this agreement or any other agreement of this kind. We are not talking about a small amount of travel information about European citizens, but rather about the combination of this information with other long-established databases, enabling profiling and thus the monitoring of individual citizens. We reject this agreement because no adequate evidence has been provided – not even by you, Ms Malmström – of the possible benefits of this agreement. We also oppose it because proportionality and purpose limitation are taken to absurd lengths when millions of data records belonging to innocent citizens are retained. We reject it because the use of this data goes far beyond the purpose you have indicated – the fight against terrorism and the combating of serious, organised, cross-border crime. Article 4 contains an escape clause that also needs to be discussed. This clause significantly widens the purpose for which data can be used. We cannot support this agreement because it involves the processing and forwarding of the PNR data to an authority, the Department of Homeland Security, where the intelligence services hold power, and even to third countries; none of this can be controlled by Parliament, so that there is no guarantee of transparency. We reject the agreement because the period for which the data is to be retained goes against all understanding of proportionality and appropriateness, whereby even sensitive data can be retained for 30 days and possibly even longer. This is scandalous. It is quite impossible for our group to vote in favour because there is no serious provision for judicial remedy. The judicial remedy provisions contained in the agreement are laughable. All that is offered is a limited right to information and it is not even possible to take legal recourse according to a proper data protection law. This is just not possible. Judicial remedy is transformed into the obstruction of justice. To Mr Voss and the other Members who intend voting in favour of this agreement I would say: if our own EU Treaties mean anything to us, then we must reject this agreement. It is all a question of responsibility, Mr Voss, namely responsibility to the citizens of the European Union. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, our group supported the call at the time of the last amendment to the Biometric Passports Regulation in 2009 for a review to be carried out in three years’ time and for four studies to be presented. One of the reasons that our group supported this was because it has expressed major concerns time and again on the grounds of data protection and also on account of the overestimation of the benefit of using biometric data in passports. The belief in the perfect form of identification, the overestimation of this method too, and – associated with this – the overestimation of other parts of the security chain are genuinely problematic. The use of biometric data is still subject to this major misconception, namely the assumption that these data are unchangeable and mostly reliable. That is absolutely not the case. These data are also subject to change throughout a person’s life. They differ between childhood and old age. We therefore need reliable and sound studies and conclusions. People are still busily forging these documents. We have now been able to establish this. As the incidents in the United Kingdom and other countries repeatedly demonstrate, the chips are definitely not safe from misuse. They are readily cracked and, for those concerned, this can result in permanent damage. The standards within the EU also differ widely. The error rate – as seen in France and the Netherlands – is very high. We need to ask ourselves again and again what benefit we get from biometric data if documents are falsified and enter into circulation. Thus, if one part of the chain is falsified and the ‘breeder’ documents are at variance, biometric data would no longer be of any help to us. The Chaos Computer Club in Germany needed a few minutes only to demonstrate the falsification of a chip. For this, the people of the Chaos Computer Club needed the cap of a plastic bottle, some superglue, a digital camera and a little wood glue, and in a few minutes they had cracked the chip. So much for supposed security. We are waiting for the Commission to present the studies and, of course, also the results and the lessons that can be drawn from them. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, has anyone in this Parliament actually ever written a report about the number of men in middle and top positions who are mediocre, low-achievers? Had there been such a report, it would have observed – as we already know from our real lives – that a great number of men who really are not effective and not particularly brilliant nevertheless occupy top positions. We would also have hit upon the idea that perhaps the factor of excellence in performance, which is supposed to be the sole criterion for top positions, is not, in fact, the only factor. There is a glass ceiling for women, also known as structural discrimination, and as long as that is the case, we will need this quota. It is very crude tool: all the quota does is to create formal equality, which is the prerequisite for bringing about real equality of rights and fairness between the sexes. It seems to me that we should not beat around the bush, we should give this our clear support and I am therefore nailing my colours to the mast in support of this quota. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am still somewhat astonished. After years of Mr Barroso and his colleagues in the Council having pursued a policy of austerity, and successfully having forced upon everyone unemployment and cuts in social security spending under the umbrella of the crisis, they have now discovered the unemployed. As important as this subject certainly is, it sounds like mockery if you see the promotional film for it on EuroparlTV, which talks about additional funding. I have a simple question for you, Mr Hahn, namely, where in your petty cash can you find EUR 82 billion? We all know that everything is actually already planned up to 2013 – and we are not far from the point where that door will be closing. We should not be dealing in tricks, nor should we be talking as if everyone could now receive the same funding or indeed adequate funding. Quite specifically, what is the situation with Ireland, for example, which, as we all know, has already spent all of its resources? What advice do you have for the Irish Government when it comes to combating youth unemployment? It is self-evident that we need to make major efforts in employment policy in order to reduce youth unemployment. That much is clear, but we also need real money to be able to do so. We also need to get behind it. Furthermore, there are, of course, other things that we need, such as more sensible protection against dismissal, or truly decent work. Finally, I would just like to reiterate what it is that we do not need, namely macro-economic conditionality over the forthcoming subsidy period. That is something that we should not even look into. We are observing at this point in time what that means. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent sanctions by the EU are not confidence-building measures, but sabre rattling. That is a fact. Attempting to get Iran to compromise by exerting more pressure is politically naive and also irresponsible. As the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, we do not want any nuclear programmes, that is clear, including in Iran. We strongly condemn the Iranian regime on account of its horrendous human rights violations, oppression of religious minorities and persecution of human rights activists, but stopping Iranian oil as a result of the de facto trade ban with Iran’s Central Bank will ultimately hit ordinary citizens. That is a fact. It will also help the Iranian regime’s election campaign ahead of the elections in March this year and will increase the risk of war throughout the region. That, Baroness Ashton, is the scale of what we are talking about here. There is as yet no genuine proof that Iran has a current nuclear weapons programme. There are indications up to 2003, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has provided no evidence for the period thereafter in its report. It has assumptions and the claims of the secret services. Instead of an escalation, we need a human rights dialogue and serious negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Middle East and peaceful coexistence throughout the region. That is what the EU should be doing instead of making the current situation worse. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I would like to make the following point. We are not talking about the economic situation in Hungary. We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries. It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants. Instead, I would like to see Article 7 applied, because this situation involves a clear risk of a serious breach of the fundamental values of the EU. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the combined work and residence permit for third-country nationals in the EU came in like a lion and is going out like a lamb, to coin a phrase. This in no way opens the way for a truly simplified regulation for third-country nationals who would like to work in the EU. That remains the case even if residence is increasingly being linked with work. In many cases that may be all well and good – but it is the only focus here, and we see that as a problem. Furthermore, we do not feel that this directive is a step in the right direction. Firstly, this is because its scope is too narrow. Its provisions are narrow-minded and provincial. It is not just that it is only to be applicable to the executing Member State and not to the EU as a whole; that does not even get mentioned any more. It is also that the regulation is not to apply to family members of Union citizens if they are third-country nationals, nor to seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees or people under international or temporary protection. This gives rise to all kinds of individual directives, and as a result there are different classes of third-country nationals with differing rights. My second point is that there is no real simplification or legal harmonisation, and this is true through the mere fact that the Member States actually have the final say on all matters – such as whether it is the employer or the employee who is to apply for the permit. If it is the employer, the potential employee may not even get to see the application, such as in cases where it is rejected. He will have absolutely no opportunity to comment legally in any form whatsoever. We are also critical of the fact that an application may be deemed inadmissible if the Member State sets quotas for the labour market. The third point I would like to make – and I will concede this to the rapporteur – is that it is good that pension entitlements will be recognised. It is absolutely unacceptable, however, that there is not completely equal treatment with employees who are EU nationals. There are to be considerable restrictions – and these will depend on the class of person – when it comes to vocational training, social benefits – such as for family members – and access to public housing. That is really not acceptable. If that is made a fundamental principle, then it is a mistake and we cannot support it. That is why we are rejecting this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, a few hours ago, an important prize was awarded here in this Chamber. It was said that freedom, justice and solidarity are pillars of the European Union. However, I would like to ask you: how can that be reconciled with the fact that racist violence against the Roma is to a certain degree the order of the day in very many Member States and is a constant state of affairs in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and the Balkans? It is also the case that Roma, who are EU citizens, are being expelled not only from France, but also from Denmark, Italy, Germany and Finland. However, freedom, solidarity and justice, of which we speak so often here, should apply universally or not at all. It is scandalous – I cannot put it any better – if, despite an EU framework strategy, despite numerous promises by the Member States, the largest minority in Europe continues to be discriminated against. In the Czech Republic, I spoke with Roma families that were utterly shocked and, above all, frightened because anti-Roma demonstrations had been taking place for months right outside their front door – and with banners containing the words: ‘gas the Roma’! That is shocking, not just as a neighbour of these Roma, but it also not worthy of our history when we simply tolerate such a thing or attempt to change it with the use a few more police officers. In the Czech Republic, as in many other countries, Roma children still attend separate schools – and in the Czech Republic, for example, they go to schools with disabled children. As a left-leaning politician, I say to you that the Roma do not belong in separate schools, and neither do disabled children. That violates human rights and I believe that that needs to be said in this regard. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that separate schools for Roma are illegal. Despite this, these schools merrily continue. As we all know, the European Roma Rights Centre has examined 44 cases in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and found that violent attacks on Roma were utterly inadequately prosecuted and that no convictions were brought at all. Many law enforcement agencies are totally blind when it comes to the Roma. Moreover, the Czech Senate unabashedly confirmed recently that it will not participate in a Roma strategy. That is apartheid in action at the heart of Europe. We have to do something about this. There will also be a price to pay for the fact that the Roma framework strategy does not lay down any binding requirements and that the subject of anti-racism does not form part of this strategy. I can say to you quite honestly that enough is enough.; I would ask the Commission how long it intends to continue to sit back and watch. Where is the consistency in its actions when it comes, for example, to framework decisions for combating racism and the Anti-discrimination Directive being implemented – properly implemented – in the Member States? Article 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for the possibility of action being taken against Member States that have seriously breached the values of the EU. I therefore call on you most urgently to make use of this provision. After all, we must defend the rights and freedoms of the Roma as European citizens. Who will do that if we do not?

Mr President, I have a question for Mr Hahn concerning the delegated acts. These acts play an important role in cohesion policy and it is also clear to me that delegated acts are necessary for the implementation of a number of issues. Parliament and the Council also have a withdrawal option, which is a good thing. However, I believe that the situation has got rather out of hand and that these acts are being used in the case of questions which we in Parliament should be deciding on together with the Council. One example is the common strategic framework, Articles 10 and 11 of the general regulation, which lays down goals for subsidies from the Cohesion Fund, important challenges in the territorial area and actions to be taken centrally. My question is: why have you chosen the delegated act in the case of such an important document, for example, and not the ordinary legislative procedure? In this context, perhaps you can make some general remarks about the problems of delegated acts. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Hahn, you have already made some remarks on macro-economic conditionality. You have said that it will probably not be used at all, or at least only in an emergency or a similar situation. However, I would like to ask you nevertheless: is there a built-in safeguard and is it possible to prevent particularly disadvantaged regions, which would not receive money if a conditionality of this kind were to take effect, being put at a further disadvantage?

 Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a broader scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is taking a clear stance against this agreement, and will vote accordingly, in the clear knowledge that there are some aspects of the agreement that might seem acceptable according to the principle of ‘a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Of course we have understood this, thanks to Ms in ’t Veld. The counter-arguments are more convincing, however. We still have no proof of the need to record PNR data. The mass of data, or so-called waste data, actually makes it harder to find potential criminals. Despite everything, what we have here is a willy-nilly approach to data retention, even when no suspicion exists, and this, as my colleague has pointed out, is prohibited, not just in Germany but in several other Member States too. We wish to register genuinely serious concerns that this agreement cannot be reconciled with EU law. That is why we requested a corresponding legal opinion, which we are also presenting for the purposes of the discussion and vote. Even though it is, of course, better to a certain extent to have some sort of retention period rather than none at all, I would ask you seriously why it is necessary to store data for five-and-a-half years. This makes profiling realistic and feasible, particularly since it is not completely and definitively excluded by this agreement. A word about the scope of the agreement: the Commissioner referred to the fact that serious cross-border crime does not exist as a criminal offence in Australia. It simply does not exist. Instead of a minimum mandatory sentence of four years, we would have been better served with a list of specific criminal offences. Otherwise, our main concern is that this agreement will be used as the template for negotiations with the US, but not because the agreement is so bad, but rather because at least in Australia the data is processed by the customs authorities when it arrives there, while in the US, the responsible authority is the unknown quantity that is the Department of Homeland Security. This agreement turns innocent people into objects of suspicion on a wholesale basis and undermines elementary freedoms. My group wants nothing to do with this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, body scanners are placebos. If you look it up in Wikipedia, a placebo is a sham medicine that contains no active ingredient and thus has no pharmacological effect. The fact is that a ten-month test phase in Germany, for example, showed that body scanners resulted in a lower level of security than conventional methods and were therefore a failure. Sweat stains were signalled as a security risk, tissues as a danger. There were false alarm levels of up to 100%. No body scanner in the world can analyse body orifices or inside the body. Objects hidden there cannot be detected. We should not suppose that terrorists are more stupid than they are. Where body scanners were used regularly, it was not the success rate that went up, but rather the abuse rate. Take a look at the US: a woman there had to remove her breast prosthesis to prove what it was, and that was after scanning. In the UK, two women refused to be scanned for religious or health reasons and were not permitted to fly. The most embarrassing body checks exist as alternatives in various countries. The risk of abuse is likely to rise further in the future simply because the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided, as stated previously, that real body images are possible. That means being able to see the actual outlines. There have already been cases of offensive remarks having increased and that is a human rights problem. The word placebo comes from the Latin and means ‘I will please’. The only ones this will please are the market leaders in body scanners that make and sell this rubbish. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Tavares, do you know of any examples that would actually justify the expense of spending many millions – billions in fact – on developing these body scanners? Are there examples showing that they have resulted in an increase in security? Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there can scarcely be another institution established by the European Union that is so controversial when it comes to human rights as Frontex is. This agency is associated with shameful images on the high seas where thousands of people have lost their lives, of land borders where people are kept in custody and where deep trenches are now being dug. At heart, Frontex embodies an erring policy towards refugees in Europe, refugees who leave their homelands not only as a result of political persecution, but also for economic reasons – simply to survive – as a result of hunger, civil wars and climate disasters. The new Frontex mandate does incorporate real and substantial improvements – and for that I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil – such as the obligation to respect human dignity, the right of non-refoulement, non-discrimination, the prohibition of torture, the respect of refugee minors, and the guaranteeing of data protection. Rescues at sea are now finally to be given stability and there is to be a code of conduct for border officials – but it is also true that the mandate does not lay down a principle of refraining from the use of violence. Furthermore, who is to be responsible for actually checking up on proportionality and appropriateness? Frontex is having its competence clearly expanded as the lead body in border patrols and as the body that produces risk analyses, on the basis of which interventions and the return to their homelands of thousands and thousands more migrants will take place. Heaven knows how hard Parliament struggled to obtain improvements, but they will make no difference to the fact that a wolf is still a wolf, even if it is dressed in sheep’s clothing. Frontex is not necessary either as a border agency – the national defence institutions serve that purpose – or to repel migration, as migration is not, in fact, repelled, but merely territorially displaced. Frontex is absolutely not suitable to act as custodian of human rights, given that, ultimately, it categorises people as legal or illegal. People cannot be illegal! I do not understand how that is not accepted. In place of Frontex, what we need is a humanisation of the refugee situation, in Africa, for example, where almost a million refugees live in degrading conditions. That does not interest us, or only does so to a limited extent. We would rather take care of ourselves. We need an asylum system that demonstrates solidarity, at European level too, of course, and we definitely need a new neighbourhood policy on an equal footing. That, too, still lies ahead. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what kind of anachronism is this when, 22 years after the historic fall of the Berlin Wall, an EU Member State like Denmark re-introduces border controls? This is a dire warning for the entire European Union. We all know that the Schengen agreement does indeed allow for temporary border controls to be introduced in special circumstances, as we saw with the football World Cup in Germany in 2006. The Schengen system does not need any additional mechanism. If the Danish Government re-introduces permanent controls at its borders with Germany and Sweden, that constitutes an infringement of the agreement. I expect nothing less from the Commission than to treat this as what it is – an infringement of the agreement. This genie must be re-bottled, as freedom and freedom of movement are not up for negotiation; they are fundamental values that shape the European Union. They cannot be sacrificed to national vanities and the extreme Right. We do not need to change the Schengen agreement. We need more humanitarian asylum and migration laws. We do not need additional customs officials on the German-Danish border – what we need are steps to protect refugees and people fleeing from civil war. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already adopted a number of resolutions on the subject of passenger name records (PNR), which include specific requirements. In all cases these have been concerned with necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and the prohibition of profiling. We consider the legal basis of the agreement with Australia to be inappropriate. The agreement with Australia is aimed at harmonising the transfer of data prescribed under Australian law with European law, and particularly the law on data protection. An absolute requirement, therefore, is that reference must be made to Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Moreover, we would question once again its proportionality. If you bear in mind that, according to the Australian Government, in 2009 just five people were traced and accused of terrorist offences – and it was not even clear whether this was achieved as a result of PNR data – then it does not seem particularly proportionate for millions of records nonetheless to be retained for years on end. As we all know, when it comes down to it they are being used for profiling purposes – and we do not even have a uniform agreed definition of profiling yet. I do not know how often the Commission has already been asked for such reasons to prove that the transfer of PNR data is necessary, or to present and look into alternatives. A really substantive report is necessary if this is to be investigated. One more comment on purpose limitation: how can we ensure that the data is used only for the intended purpose if various third countries conclude agreements with each other under which PNR data is systematically exchanged? This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to ensure this. Moreover, we are awaiting a very clear answer from the Commission on the relationship between PNR and the US Secure Flight programme. As everyone is aware, the purpose of the Secure Flight programme is to exclude so-called potentially dangerous passengers from flights. There have been frequent cases of mistakes being made and passengers being misidentified, as a result of which the persons concerned have been prevented from travelling and have practically no legal means by which to defend themselves. One final word: please do not forget that we are talking not just about self-determination – about self-determination in the sphere of information – but also, and above all, about freedom of movement as a basic right, as laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the intermediate category, I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning, Mr Pieper, for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 2013. However, it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions, in particular those hit by the crisis. We are currently talking about 51 regions. When confronted with so many regions that have been affected, it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category. This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves. In other respects, Mr Pieper’s report contains a great deal of light and shade. Among other things, we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty. We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation. It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Bulgaria and Romania were included in the full application of the Schengen acquis. Think about it – the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union. For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States – including my home country of Germany – totally incomprehensible. The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered. Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments. A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here. For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen. Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council’s impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents. Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one. We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September. To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati. She stated, ‘The Romanians are euphoric citizens. They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve. To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics’. That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to get to the point here. We do not need a new rule on the temporary or any other reintroduction of border controls, either now or in the future. We need to grasp that freedom of movement – and that is, after all, the message of the European Union – is something that you cannot simply displace or circumvent at will. It is a citizens’ right that you cannot simply relativise. Do you want to know what honestly annoys me? We hear a lot said about solidarity. Who is talking about solidarity with the countries of Africa who are currently having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees and will continue to do so – without great debate? Is anyone talking about solidarity with the people who are fleeing war and coming here to Europe? We need to show these people a bit of respect. To be frank, I do not want to discuss any changes to Schengen or any rules whatsoever; I simply want us to deal sensibly with migration once and for all. We will not achieve this by using Frontex as a means of deporting people; we will achieve it by having a democratic and humanitarian asylum law. That is what we should be talking about in Europe and it must apply throughout Europe. That is what we should fight for. That is our real task. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are now to have a general strategy for the Roma, but I am afraid that that not everything in the garden is rosy. That is because the overall proposals that the Commission has placed on the table are far behind the many years of discussions with representatives of the Roma, some of which were held in this House. For years, representatives of the Roma community, both with and without a framework strategy, have been pointing out the need for targeted measures and clear, specific requirements. We do not even have clear sanctions should this strategy not be adhered to. Although there have been some proposals in this direction, no actual sanctions exist, so that the system is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese. The strategy on the Roma must take account of all the significant areas. This is what was agreed. However, what does the Commission have to offer other than the four key points? There is no provision in the structures for the participation and inclusion of the Roma communities in all the decisions that relate to them. There are no structures for the specific implementation of targets. There is no gender perspective. Something that also really irritates me and that I believe to be a scandal is the fact that you are unwilling to undertake any explicit action to combat discrimination against the Roma community. You complain that the EU structural funds for the Roma are not used. I would like to ask you quite openly: Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date? I think so. We, as members of the GUE/NGL Group, are highly critical of this communication. We do not believe it to be adequate and I expect the appropriate amendments to be made. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to address three points. Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so. I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany – above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest. Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration – that is how I would describe them – are null and void. Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmström mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy’s idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million. Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled. Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing. Frontex and Dublin II – we need a rethink where these are concerned. We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to get right to the heart of the matter, this is all about introducing a uniform, mandatory EU strategy, instead of the 27 individual, differing strategies in the Member States. Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens. What is it all about? It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone. It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe. It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services. We are not doing these people a favour. We are granting them their legal rights. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti. We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding. There is, though, one thing I would like to add. None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe. We must see this as one of Europe’s central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination. We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole. We must speak with one voice. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children’s home. He wrote: ‘I have found my parents again. We are being transported to the concentration camp. After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death. Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me. Greetings to you all. See you in heaven. Robert.’ Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold. The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over. We need the whole truth about this chapter of history. The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again. We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people. We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions. Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction. The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States. The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this. A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important. It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular. However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive. Therefore, in a year’s time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs. They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made. It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status. It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part. It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking. We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging – which I openly admit – and also in many respects with illegal migration. It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and – what to me is the most important point – that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors. I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive. Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability. Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction. If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated. I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports. Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will simply ask the question: what is the situation with regard to anti-discrimination and the equal treatment of Roma in Europe? When we now hear that ethnically motivated databases on the Roma – and I believe these databases as such are prohibited – are being set up by the French Gendarmerie, but also by other countries, and, to a certain extent, for preventative purposes, then that really is the limit. Both in France and in the EU, databases that are primarily used to compile personal data on the racial or ethnic origin of people are quite simply prohibited due to the high risk of them being misused and on account of the risk of discrimination. Only under very particular – purpose-specific – circumstances, which take non-discrimination into consideration, can the collection of data of this nature be carried out at all. The Roma must not be criminalised, and that is the crucial point. Ethnically motivated databases for the purpose of preventing crimes are unlawful. The Roma must not be the subject of the special collection of data on account of their way of life, and we expect the Commission, in other words you, Mrs Reding, to repudiate any form of ethnic or racist data collection and to work hard to ensure that this is indeed stopped in the relevant countries. Frankly, I ask myself more and more what it is other than talk, talk, talk that actually happens in this Parliament and in the framework of the EU, and what, in practical terms, we have actually managed to do to improve the situation of the Roma in Europe other than talk, talk, talk. If we look at the collection of data, we see that the Roma have become scapegoats and people to push around in many Member States of the EU. They are being deported to Kosovo and, in doing this, France has been contravening EU treaties for months, the principle of anti-discrimination is being violated – and the Commission behaves as if it is satisfied – and I see this rather differently to the previous speaker – with the promise by the French Government to provide the legal basis for transposing the directive on freedom of movement by the beginning of 2011. In the interests of decency, however, it must be said that France has to put a stop to the deportations of Roma, and it is also important for those Roma who have been unjustly deported to have their return to France facilitated. In connection with the databases, I would like to ask you: what definite information to you have, what initiatives will you take, if these databases actually exist in this way, and will you initiate treaty infringement proceedings in such cases? Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should ask ourselves what we are actually trying to achieve with this whole debate. Are we trying to bring about a small improvement in equality and a little assistance for families as cheaply as possible? Of course, making family life compatible with work costs money. I would simply like to ask my fellow Members from Germany: what is expenditure of EUR 1 billion in Germany if, at the same time, we are handing out EUR 450 billion in bank guarantees? What do we actually want in this area? Full pay for parental leave is quite correct. What else should it be? It is not time off, it is not holiday; this is work that people are doing. Of course we want the period extended to 20 weeks, because we believe that this is the only way this work can be accommodated. Moreover, we do not merely want to bring about a bit more equality in working life. We want complete equality, for women and men. We need to take drastic steps if we are to achieve this, such as a statutory minimum wage in all Member States. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my thanks to Mrs Fajon for her excellent report, which has really moved us forward on this issue. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is very clear in its support for visa liberalisation throughout the Western Balkans, and in this case we are, of course, also in favour of the removal of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, specifically so that the opening up of these countries actually gets under way and because it will provide better opportunities for their overall development. We hope that such opportunities will really be exploited. Personally, I would also like to see this kind of arrangement in place for Kosovo very soon – or at least for initial talks to take place. There is an urgent need for this, as Kosovo is otherwise a small island in the Western Balkans that is actually cut off. What worries me, however – and I want to make this point – is that we are compelling the introduction, at the same time, of biometric data. I want to be very clear on this: the use of biometric data is as controversial as ever and, above all, the use of such data is not secure. I say this on the back of news in Germany a few days ago that the PIN codes can be, and have been, cracked. There needs to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen. Let us do everything we can to ensure not only that these countries have their visa requirement lifted, but that social and economic development is set in train there. There is an urgent need for this in both countries, and the people have earned it. We in the EU should also work towards this goal. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called voluntary exodus of the Roma from France is a clear case of expulsion – and indeed of the largest and oldest population group that constitutes a minority in Europe. This will encourage those on the political right, the extreme right. We must reject this – including here in the European Parliament. This is vital. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left therefore demands an end to these deportations. Mrs Reding, I would have liked you, too, to call for us first to demand an end to these deportations and then everything else that follows on from that. President Sarkozy’s government is contravening EU law, because it is carrying out the wholesale deportation of Roma, who originate from EU Member States, without consideration of individual cases, because it is invalidating the principle of free movement, it is violating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is violating the Charter with regard to equal treatment. I say to you in all sincerity that it is finally time for action. We have already discussed this problem numerous times. We now need to take real measures that will bring about a change. The Roma are at home in Europe. They are part of the European Community and should also remain so. We must make sure of it. We are therefore also critical of the deportation of Roma from Germany, Austria, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and other countries in the Western Balkans. We need an integrated European strategy, and one for all Roma, not only some of them. We must fight for this. My final point is that the European idea of solidarity and self-determination must be evident in our dealings with the Roma minority, otherwise it does not exist. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate must focus on two aspects. One aspect, namely that of data protection, has now been very frequently addressed. It is quite true that some things have been improved, but the simple fact is that the transfer of bulk data has not been eliminated. What really annoys me the most is that, where data protection is concerned, Europol has, in fact, been given an extension of its powers: on what legal basis, we ask? However, I also wish to say quite clearly that there is also another aspect, about which we must talk very seriously, namely that even if all the data protection problems were to be solved, every last one, the question would remain whether the principle according to which the bank data of millions of people in Europe is transferred for prevention purposes actually makes a real contribution to the fight against terror. I doubt it profoundly, and there has been no evaluation and nothing to support it. Instead, a de facto
 surveillance of citizens will be introduced, and I wish to remind you that even the Data Protection Officer does not see the necessity of such a regulation. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, let me say that I believe – and I am referring to the Schengen Information System here – that the EU should not be operating a wish-based policy, but a policy based on the reality. When it comes to the Schengen Information System, that means that we must take account of the fact that the tests – what have been called the ‘first milestone’ – have failed. After eight years of tinkering, we know that the aim of the measure proposed by the Commission – the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II – is unachievable by the Member States, both on technical and legal grounds. That is not my evaluation – it is the evaluation of the Federal Republic of Germany. That is the position back in my home country, and it is a position, by the way, that I fully share. EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme, and the Commission would like to spend more. We do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013; we want to make that very plain. Instead, we want to abandon this system and start the search for an alternative. Secondly, the German Left Party is fundamentally critical of SIS II – I want to point that out, too, at this juncture – as access to the system is being dramatically extended, for example, to the secret services. In Germany, there is a requirement that the secret services and the police are separated. Thus, any mixing of the secret services’ and the police’s data will mean that the whole system will be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court. That is something that I needed to mention, at least from the German point of view. We also oppose SIS II because it involves the collection of vast quantities of data and the gathering and recording of biometric data. That is neither purposive nor proportionate.

Madam President, freedom over the clouds, as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang, will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data. In August, a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having. Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists, the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space. As we all know in this House, this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding. Today, US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data – credit card numbers, booking data, seating preferences, special food preferences, IP addresses and passenger information – without clear data protection regulations. I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that, as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying, referred to as PNR, as it now is to be developed. We cannot support it as it is currently formulated, because it is not for a specific purpose, and it is not proportionate or useful. Finally, I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour. We need disclosure regulations like the USA’s privacy act. These must be opened to European citizens. The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague who is unable to be here and I would like to make a few remarks. The first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the Structural Funds. There are certainly some things which we would criticise and Mrs Schroedter has mentioned these, but I believe that we should not hold back for this reason alone. We welcome the simplification and are also of the opinion that the regulation must be implemented urgently. Too much time has already been wasted. However, I must speak openly. The compromise is not exactly how we had envisaged it. As everyone is aware, the Commission submitted another proposal relating to the one-off 100% payment of interim payment claims for a limited period and for the purpose of labour market policy measures. This was not accepted for a variety of reasons which were discussed in detail in the Committee on Regional Development. However, we must ask ourselves whether we have done enough to put in place what the Commission referred to in its communication of 3 June 2009 as a common commitment to employment which can be used to counteract the crisis. The objective was to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to help overcome the crisis and this is what we are discussing now. The European Structural Funds in particular are, as everyone knows, one of the main tools for investing in citizens and for combating the crisis and creating jobs. If we take a look at Europe, it becomes clear that the crisis has had a huge impact on the labour markets in the Member States and that action really is needed. There have been massive increases in unemployment, not only in the five countries, but in all the Member States, if we look at the situation in detail. In addition, unemployment also plays a major role independently of the crisis. In Europe, we have a very high level of unemployment which is still rising and is unrelated to the crisis. The alternative proposal submitted by the Commission certainly represents a step forward, which we welcome, because at least five Member States with a GDP that has fallen by 10% since 2008 will receive a relatively large subsidy. These Member States will benefit from this and from additional advance payments from the Cohesion and European Structural Funds. All of this is good, but we would like to see more being done. You know what our position is from what we have said in the committee. On the one hand, we are happy and, on the other hand, not so happy, but every step forward takes us forward too and this is where we should be going.

 Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, I think we believed that we had only a limited chance and therefore decided against it. I assume that my colleague thought the same thing. When I looked at the Commission’s overall initiative, I was thrilled. However, after long discussions on these subjects in the last few days, I have learnt a few things. I would have liked to see more. It is true that we could have submitted an amendment, you are right. However, if we are honest with one another, we know what will happen and this is why my group decided against an amendment. I must take note of that myself. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, thank you very much. We have two amendments, one of which is an amendment to the amendment. I would like to introduce both of them. We would like the words ‘the Council and’ to be deleted. The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be:  ‘calls on the Member States to refrain from forced repatriations of minorities if they face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment once they have been forcibly returned’. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, in December 2009, when I was in Pristina and Mitrovica and saw how people are living in the Mahala and, in particular, in the lead-contaminated camps, I was rather shocked, particularly about the plight of the children. In almost every conversation I had, I was told that, not only in Kosovo, but also in many countries in Europe, the situation is dire for one of the oldest population groups in Europe, namely the Roma. I met Bekim Syla from the Roma and Ashkali Documentation Centre in Pristina, who received us with the words ‘We are tired of talking’. Action needs to be taken, and therefore our absolute highest expectation of the Córdoba Summit is that there will be more than mere talk and that action will be taken immediately. Immediate action means not resting on our laurels behind the EU directives implementing the principle of equal treatment, of equal treatment of persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, and also the Employment Framework Directive, because it will not do any good. Immediate action requires the recognition and assumption that these directives are not sufficient to protect the Roma in the European Union from degrading and discriminatory treatment and – most importantly – to enable their permanent integration. What we need, therefore, is a European Roma strategy that is a component of all policy areas – an integral component of all policies. However, the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures. What we need are medium and long-term political initiatives. We urgently need measures for the economic development of the Roma communities. The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible; it must do so now, so that the Roma can also benefit from it. This includes micro-credit loans, which need to be issued with as little bureaucracy as possible, for example, for the reconstruction of Roma settlements. It includes very specific measures for the promotion of health and for education, training and the development of the labour market. I would like to make it quite clear that no child should fail because of educational or language barriers. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left does not want Roma schools, but schools for everyone, where the Roma can also live and learn. I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism. Antiziganism must not be regarded as or remain a trivial offence, but must be punished as a crime. The EU bears a lot of the responsibility for the extent to which, it is to be hoped, we will soon succeed in bringing about justice for the more than 10 million Roma in Europe, because it starts with justice and should continue with equality. For this, we need a very clear political ‘yes’ and a resolute, powerful European framework strategy, and – quite frankly – it also needs our passionate commitment, as MEPs and as people, to this population group – the Roma and Sinti. Let us take action now. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is absolutely indisputable that body scanners quite clearly represent an invasion of privacy and a serious invasion at that. We need to ask ourselves two questions. The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism. We do not currently have any clear answers to this question. This is why I support what Mrs Malmström has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners. I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else. The second question concerns the risks to health. Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week. I would have to do so at least twice a week. This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health. No real assessments have been carried out in this area. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made. Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, human trafficking is, in reality, a scourge of the present day, and it feeds on poverty and ignorance. Its worst form is the trafficking of children, which is often linked to sexual abuse. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left believe that there is an urgent need for action on the Commission’s part. One of the most important prerequisites for successfully combating human trafficking is strengthening the rights of the victims. Only if this succeeds – and not only through punitive measures – can human trafficking be combated at all. That requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims. One of the things these victims need is effective protection and support before, during and also after criminal proceedings in which they testify as witnesses. This must be a high priority for the period of reconsideration, specifically, as well as where witness testimonies are retracted. Long-term witness protection programmes are urgently needed. Another thing that I think is important is that all victims of human trafficking, not just children, must be given free counselling. When dealing with children it is also necessary – coming back to this point – for it to be made possible to make use of child-specialist lawyers. There is a need for urgent measures to strengthen prevention, such as training for lawyers, the police, judges and counsellors. I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency intends to address this issue.

 Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission’s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased. In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions. Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed. The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan. Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy. We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy. Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education. The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here. This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters. However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances. Time is running out! Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be giving the resolution its backing. The Stockholm Programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day. Its main error is that a Europe of rights is being created to which EU citizens will be granted access but others who live in Europe will not. These other people will not be entitled to the same human and civil rights. The EU wants to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights – something that we welcome – yet, at the same time, migrants are to be separated out according to the ‘legal or illegal’ principle. Frontex is therefore being tooled up to wage war on so-called illegal migration, completely obscuring the idea of an unprejudiced immigration policy from view. This is where Stockholm fails. Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security. It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being. Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU’s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis. This will mean the shredding of people’s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality. Allow me, as an MEP from eastern Germany, to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vehemently reject the measures being taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to deport Roma and other minorities to Kosovo. Soon, around 2 500 people are to be deported per year. These measures particularly affect 10 000 Roma, but also Egyptians and Ashkali. Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence. People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France. I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable. The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation. Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica. Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered. A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case … (The President cut off the speaker) Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 I generally believe that exemptions from and relaxation of visa rules are positive moves for the coexistence of peoples and for improving cooperation between countries. For the Western Balkans, in particular, it is important that all the countries of the region should be granted such a prospect. I therefore very much welcome the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are to be included in these regulations. Visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the Western Balkans, however. That would be the case if only Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats were able to enjoy exemption from the visa requirement while Bosnian Muslims were not. I also argue in favour of medium-term solutions for Kosovo. In so doing, I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law. That does not relieve us of the obligation to consider how this state and its citizens are to be dealt with in future, however. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, first I should like to say that we do not share the concerns of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is perfectly simple: we believe that further development towards SIS II is not necessary and is politically wrong. We take this view for three reasons: firstly, because it mixes secret service and police data, giving rise to a data system that no longer guarantees controllability and in which personal data is not, in fact, protected. The second is biometric data, which is being anchored here as a large-scale experiment and, thirdly, SIS II is, of course, to be used against so-called illegal immigration. Hence our proposal: as we all know, we have SIS I. We consider it reasonable to develop this further ‘as one for all’
. It is a pragmatic approach, even if we are strongly criticised for it. However, we believe that, with the approach being pursued here, nothing more can be done. To put it simply: SIS II is a de facto
 failure and to keep on crawling round it – to put it one way – is meaningless. What is important is that money which is being put to the wrong use here should be saved, which will mean we have fewer problems with the whole thing and can stop worrying about the delay with SIS II. I say this also from the point of view of Saxony, a region of Germany close to Poland and the Czech Republic. I know full well here that it would certainly make more sense to do something towards stabilisation within the police than to introduce something like this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a new MEP, let me start by saying that human rights issues are also extremely important to my party, the German Left, and that we condemn any violation of human rights – irrespective of where or by whom they are committed. That has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs. I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that, time and again, human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered. Natalia Estemirova, Stanislav Markelov, Zarema Sadulayeva, these are examples of murders that are truly shocking. It is therefore important that we in this House concern ourselves with this issue. I am concerned that cases like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya are not investigated. If this process is now re-opened, I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested, because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind. What we expect is simply for an immediate and full investigation to be carried out into these murders and for this matter to be dealt with ruthlessly, for Russia not to wait any longer but to take up the fight to protect human rights itself. It must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death. I also believe that the forthcoming EU-Russia summit needs to tackle these issues as a matter of urgency, and not merely as side issues, but with the prominence that they deserve. Personally, I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this House. I would have preferred not to debate issues such as these on Thursday afternoon and I believe this topic should also concern us even if it was about enterprise and trade. Such issues are often given secondary priority. That is what we want to change and that is also something I wanted to say here. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in the light of yesterday’s debate and with a clear look towards Ukraine, I would suggest that we clearly state that it is the right of the Ukrainian people to decide on their future without any international intervention. Therefore, I suggest replacing Amendment 1 with the following wording: ‘underlines the fact that it is for the Ukrainian people – and only for them – to decide, free from foreign interference, on the geopolitical orientation of the country and on which international agreements and communities Ukraine should join’. I suggest that the sentence should be added as a new last sentence to paragraph 19. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Commissioner, thank you. I want to thank all participating colleagues, in particular the rapporteurs and the team involved in negotiating the result. I also want specially to thank the NGOs and civil society which have ensured that pressure from outside Parliament encouraged us to take up the responsibility in this directive, in particular the NGO Publish What You Pay, because of their struggle for the items included in our directive. But they have achieved only the first step. Ecological and employment criteria form part of the responsibility we have to take into account. We also want to recognise that the requirement of country-by-country reporting of taxes and other financial data by companies in all sectors has to be included, and I guess that the discussion is just now under way among Member States and the Commission about extending  financial transparency to all sectors, as I have already said earlier, especially to tackle the widespread tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance that costs governments billions of euros each year and which belongs to the theme we have been discussing here.

Mr President, even though it is late, this is a matter on which we are doubtless all agreed: investments are important. The rule of law is a central prerequisite for the flow of investments. Ensuring compliance with the law, however, is a task for the courts.  Commissioner, you want to ensure, in binding national agreements between the EU and third countries, the right for investors to take action against governments, leaving judgment to trade specialists to whom environmental or other social interests do not matter. With this law you deprive the governments of the Member States of the right to defend their own political majority decisions, such as the withdrawal from nuclear energy. You even want to be able to force them to relinquish their position and take over the position of the Commission. What is the point then in having elections?  Internationally the number of such lawsuits has increased more than tenfold to nearly 500 at this moment in time. It is a mighty billion-dollar arbitration industry in its own right. On average we are talking about USD 8 million in legal costs and over USD 100 million in compensation claims per case. This law creates the foundations for the plundering of the European Union and its Member States by specialised law firms and corporations. From which budget line do you want to pay for lost lawsuits? That is not clear, and we have to discuss the whole issue at length. I also want to thank the rapporteur; while we were discussing the report, we established that this question is still open and on the table. I would also like to expand on the third question we raised. Companies in the European Union have to go via the ordinary courts, but you wish to enable investors from the outside to make use of the State method, which provides for far greater sums and compensation for damages. Do you intend to encourage companies to establish a branch abroad and then sue the EU or its Member States as an external plaintiff? A recent study concludes that in the text foreseen on the agreement with Canada, the CETA agreement, the wording on the table enables exactly this procedure, and legal action could soon be started against us, for example regarding the legislation prohibiting or regulating fracking.  I therefore cannot agree to the proposed bill and we will probably reject it, but I would like to receive certain answers to the questions we raised. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, I want to stress very clearly that the disappearance of Sombath Somphone is a most worrying example of the practice of arbitrary arrest by elements of the police. The world is watching this case very closely. I urge the Government of Laos to do its utmost to find and release Sombath Somphone. I call on High Representative Lady Ashton to make it absolutely clear that the outcome of this case will be a benchmark for the rule of law in Laos and that it will be crucial for the judgment on whether or not Laos qualifies for an enhancement in our relations, including trade relations. I welcome the fact that our colleagues from the ASEAN parliaments have already undertaken a fact-finding mission to Laos and I call on the ASEAN Human Rights Commission to set up immediately a committee to investigate the events surrounding the enforced disappearance of Sombath Somphone.  Finally, we will be watching closely in future because Laos has to understand that we will make the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as environmental and labour standards, a precondition for further relations between us and them.

Mr President, yesterday we had a very sensitive, emotional debate on the trade agreement on Colombia and Peru. It was a controversial issue for several political groups. My group will therefore ask Parliament to withhold its consent today and send the agreement back to the Committee on International Trade, for three main reasons which I have circulated to Members, and you can read in your mailboxes. Firstly, we have a study which explains that there is no provision to control and monitor financial flows in the agreement with Colombia and Peru, the two biggest coca exporters, whereas there are such provisions in other FTAs. On the one hand, the agreement seeks to close the window for tax evasion, tax fraud and money laundering, while on the other hand, it opens doors wide open to similar activities. The second reason is the human rights situation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and several trade unions have explained that the human rights situation is not such that we should consent to the conclusion of this agreement.  Thirdly, the trade unions, ETUC and other such organisations are asking us not to give our consent. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Jörg Leichtfried. In my view, he has succeeded in devising a way forward which all the groups can support. I know from experience that the negotiations that lie ahead will not be easy, especially as a number of Member States have what I can only describe as an allergic reaction to the issue of delegated acts. Despite the lip service paid in fine speeches to the importance of the European Parliament and how it should be granted more powers, these same government representatives are refusing to recognise Parliament’s equal role to the Council, as an legislator with equal rights, when it comes to amending the legislative procedure. As a legislator, however, we are prepared to delegate powers to the Commission in specific cases, subject to a limit in time, while retaining a right of veto.  The Council is no longer the only institution to sit at the table with the Commission. I therefore urge the Council to stop dragging its feet. Due to this issue, we have already lost far too much time on a number of important dossiers. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, we should give very careful consideration to the causes and the effect. We are in danger of taking a very short-sighted view of complex economic and social developments and, with populist actions, unleashing a trade war with China. That is the last thing the European Union needs at present! Yes, we need fair trade and fair production, but what has actually happened? As a result of cutbacks in the support schemes in Germany and other countries, the photovoltaic market was artificially constricted, resulting in increased competition. If this triggers a major dispute at the political level, we jeopardise the trade links of manufacturers of polysilicon, as well as putting exports in other sectors at risk. We also jeopardise the global supply of technologies that we urgently need for the transformation of our energy systems. Mr Jadot has already highlighted the challenges associated with renewable energies. Our discussions about the EU budget and the positions of the EU Member States on drastic budget cuts also have implications for the issue that is the subject of this debate. We cannot achieve a solution through confrontation. We can only do so through cooperation. I would therefore urge the Commission to make arrangements as soon as possible, as time is really pressing, for a joint forum for European, US and Chinese manufacturers and to support networking between developers, producers and distributors in these three key regions.

Madam President, Commissioner, 92.72727 % was the result celebrated by President Lukashenko’s associates in the most recent parliamentary elections. Otherwise, everything is following an all-too-familiar pattern: the election observers deliver their detailed verdict on the obviously-not-free-and-fair nature of the elections, we adopt our motion for a resolution and the Council imposes a few more sanctions or extends the existing ones. Beyond the Bug, the new parliament remains without an opposition and, therefore, exempt from criticism and correction, while those who want to see a different Belarus are still excluded, persecuted or locked up. The daily lives of Belarusians are still governed by the arbitrariness of politics and the greed of oligarchs.  In the description and assessment of this development, there is barely anything to choose between the political groups of this House. I also believe that nobody expected any other result or any changes to take place in Belarus. However, if that is true, then I must, at this point, reiterate the doubts I have already expressed on repeated occasions. Sanctions appear to be ineffective as a tool. They have not previously had any serious impact, either in Belarus or elsewhere.  Mr Füle has spoken again on the EU’s current activities as regards Belarus. We consider much of that to be worthwhile, such as the direct engagement with civil society under the European dialogue on modernisation. The problem with these activities, however, is that they fail to address Belarusians in their specific circumstances as consumers and workers. People want to discuss the job market, not industrial relations, co-determination rights or compliance with International Labour Organisation or environmental standards and so on. However, if these sessions are not used to tackle the issues of social justice faced on both sides of the Bug, then the foundations of the autocratic system undeniably still in place in Belarus will barely shake.  I would like to conclude with the following point: when we lived in a divided Europe, it was extremely important that, in spite of all the criticism levelled at those in power, a line of communication was kept open. Historically, we have shifted from sanctions to dialogue. It seems to me that, at present, we are moving in the opposite direction. In view of the obvious ineffectiveness of this policy, the question is: what do we do when we have exhausted all the options, when we have tightened the last thumbscrew? It is better to begin to confront the political leaders of Belarus with our arguments and demands in the context of political dialogue. That requires the EU Member States to cast aside their contradictory policy. The use of sanctions against repressive states does nothing to alter the repressive system of the State in question.

Madam President, Commissioner, as we discuss – not for the first time – the accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the Russian Federation, it is easy to forget that trade with the Russian Federation is, and in my opinion will continue to be, of strategic relevance to Europe because there is so much of it and because of the direction it is taking.  I would like to respond to the report by Mr Sturdy, since he examines the status of the relationship with the Russian Federation from economic perspectives, taking Russia’s accession to the WTO, after years of negotiation, as the reference point. I am grateful to the permanent rapporteur for trade negotiations with the Russian Federation for not allowing himself to ignore troubling news about social conflicts, increasingly arbitrary behaviour by the authorities and new, ambivalent legal situation in Russia, but for sticking soberly to the facts.  There are policy areas that cannot just be subsumed under the logic and dynamism of foreign policy. We have talked about this here several times before. Parliament should also form policy with a view to economic cooperation and create trade relations independently of political trends. I welcome the fact that the Commission representatives here in Parliament recently made a commitment to guarantee the stability of this relationship and, as a consequence, to take the Russian leadership at its word regarding the modernisation of the country and its interest in having the EU at its side as a partner. One of the major lessons of the earlier conflicts in Europe is that rapprochement brings change. Mutual rapprochement works in the 21st century but only on an equal footing and through joint efforts. Trade is not an instrument for this rapprochement but does have exactly this effect. This change, which, along with further economic cooperation, we feel is justified, should have as its aim a movement towards greater social justice, less poverty, greater democracy, obviously greater rule of law and thus respect for human rights. We know that the rule of law without democracy – or vice versa – does not work. However, greater democracy without greater social justice, greater application of trade union rights, international labour norms, environmental standards, etc. is even worse. This also applies to the serious consideration of the impacts of the Russian Federation’s accession to the WTO, which in the medium term are not easy to predict, on jobs in industry, the service sector and elsewhere.  I believe we should also take a fresh look at trade barriers. What is really preventing trade with Russia at present is not only trade barriers as we define them but also the continued existence of the visa requirement. The statements at the EU-Russia summit in this regard read well but have not added anything of substance yet. We ought to change this. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an intelligent agreement between the EU and Japan would lead to stronger integration of the two economies. It goes without saying that 128 million potential customers in high-wage Japan offer very attractive prospects for European companies and their workforces in a range of sectors. Mutual integration of know-how in production chains could improve the global competitiveness of thousands of supplier companies. As you hear, I am using the subjunctive, because both your report this evening, Commissioner De Gucht, and important paragraphs in the EP resolution now before us make no offer of partnership; rather, they make unilateral demands to Japan. In my view, that is not a good starting point for long-term cooperation that brings mutual benefits. What we are discussing this evening is the mandate for the negotiations. I am in favour of a clear, frank and open-ended discussion of the differences between the EU and Japan around the negotiating table. A real partnership cannot be based on either side dictating terms. That is why, as a Group, we have problems with the text of the resolution. Let us have a look at it. There are large chunks of the text that appear to have been written by the car industry. At a time when we are facing a climate crisis, how can we seriously demand a commitment from the Japanese Government to abolish the special treatment for electric and hybrid vehicles and the concessions for micro vehicles such as Kei-Cars
, just so that we can export more diesel-powered vehicles? The resolution’s over-emphasis on the abolition of non-tariff measures also conflicts with the findings of the Copenhagen study on trade between the EU and Japan. This study recognises that many of these measures help to improve general welfare, especially in the fields of health, the environment and consumer protection. We should therefore look at what the proposed arrangements are intended to achieve and seek an outcome which brings benefits to society but still promotes trade. Furthermore, companies surveyed have mentioned other reasons why they are deterred from investing in Japan. Above all, there is the language barrier, cultural differences, which also affect consumer preferences, high taxes and wage costs. Anyone who is reluctant to pay qualified translators, or to develop successful marketing strategies to promote their goods in Japan, or to pay local wages and taxes should invest at home instead. These types of trade barrier cannot and should not be removed by an agreement. In this context, the Committee on International Trade gained some very interesting insights last year into the strategy pursued by IKEA, a very large company that has tailored its operations to suit Japanese consumption patterns, culture and social standards. We need an agreement with non-tariff elements of cooperation. Joint programmes can bring together businesses and trade unions, consumer associations, academics, administrators and young people from Europe and Japan. Let us work towards a new culture of cooperation. That would also bring practical benefits for Europe’s SMEs in terms of energy efficiency and high-tech cooperation. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a proposal from you, Commissioner, that has the potential to do enormous damage to Europe’s reputation. While our partners are still engaged in negotiations with the Commission, you are looking to put a gun to their heads, forcing them to capitulate under the threat of exclusion from the European market. Your approach has completely discredited the European Union as a partner in negotiations. Ambassadors from all the relevant countries have vividly described to me what is at stake for them and their population. The Committee on Development, armed with excellent and reliable barometers of mood in the African partner states, has recognised this and has therefore completely rejected the Commission’s proposal in the statement from my colleague and group chair Gabi Zimmer. My group is strongly supportive of this position, even in view of the trade-related aspects. I would call on all Members of this House, including my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, to take this development policy perspective to heart and not to risk decades of close cooperation because of a short-sighted unilateral decision by the Commissioner for Trade. We will have a roll-call vote. Commissioner De Gucht, your regulation would be devastating for the East African community. You risk isolating Kenya from the other Member States or causing this association of states to wave goodbye to Europe as its most important partner. A number of trading nations around the world would be happy at this development. You have made an unjust accusation against the Africans. You are seeking to punish a delay for which you yourself are responsible. Why, for example, is the Commission insisting on abolishing export taxes? Namibia only levies such taxes on raw materials exports. If primary processing takes place in Namibia itself, no taxes are payable. I see this as smart and legitimate economic policy, pointing the way for an industrial policy that is completely in line with the objectives of EU development policy. Commissioner, you are taking a very short-sighted approach that runs counter to the medium- and long-term interests of Europe and the expansion of its trade relations. I would call on you to withdraw your proposal. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe have been discussing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) for months, as we also have here in this House. They came to the conclusion that they do not want or need ACTA. They are concerned that ACTA represents a threat to their freedom in the digital world. They are also worried about issues of central data protection. We have learnt during the course of this debate that the Internet has brought a new dimension to democracy and to our lives. It has become an important aspect of the way in which democracy in the European Union functions, particularly over recent weeks and months. The citizens are pinning all their hopes on the European Parliament and relying on it to defend their interests against the Commission, which has negotiated this agreement, Mr De Gucht, with a mandate from the Council over a period of six years. Two years ago, we insisted that more transparency was needed and we succeeded in bringing the secret ACTA negotiations into the light of day. Now we must not postpone this debate. We must come to a decision. We do not need to wait for the Court of Justice of the European Union, because this concerns the content of the agreement, as other Members have already said. We must decide now. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a quite different dimension. We must all work together to bring about change. We live in an age when the ways in which information and knowledge are used are becoming increasingly separated from the concept of private property. We need to develop new structures that will equate to a new legal culture concerning the access to and use of content. Children must acquire an understanding of this area in school. This is the content of the debate about ACTA and it also applies to the debate about the future development of patents, copyright, international trade and economic cooperation in a multilateral and networked world. We also need to discuss this on a multilateral basis with China, Brazil and many other countries within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and to come to an agreement about it. Mr De Gucht, I believe that you are not certain about or fully aware of the revolutionary impact of the Internet. In the case of ACTA, you are continuing to defend a business model from a period in the past when most people still went to a shop to buy records. At that time, it was mainly big non-European companies such as Sony that were making large amounts of money and they treated their artists as if they owned them. Anyone who defends this sort of monopoly is failing to support the interests of the artists. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be a good moment for democracy and for the importance of the European Parliament and that it will allow us to put an end to ACTA. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is not just the European Union that is experiencing economically difficult times. Japan, too, finds itself in a long struggle, which was made even worse by the disaster last year. The EU’s trade agreement with South Korea, a direct competitor of Japan, put the government and businesses of that country under pressure, and that also affects the jobs and overall social situation in Japan. However, while many European governments are often quickly enthused by agreements with developing countries, as these are always negotiated to the advantage of European businesses and investors, the conservatives – including in this House – are currently applying the brakes to the talks with Japan. Aware of Japan’s dire straits, some are even calling for the Japanese to kowtow before real negotiations can take place. Ladies and gentlemen, friends prove themselves in times of trouble. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be ill-advised – as certainly all of us in this House would be, too – to categorise Japan as a beggar now, rather than a partner. The dispute about non-tariff barriers to trade is also something that we should resolve eye-to-eye at the negotiating table. In those negotiations, our aim should not be to cut as many laws as possible that our trading partner has developed. We need to analyse the regulations in dispute based on their purpose and aim in order to achieve a result that provides the social benefit required but which, at the same time, favours the trade of products, without, for example, reducing levels of consumer protection or environmental targets. In addition, we also take very seriously the concerns of Japanese farmers, who see their livelihoods threatened by future European agricultural exports. Similarly, there must be no agreement if the interests of the people of Europe are not safeguarded. My group will certainly not vote in favour of any treaty in which the investment protection chapter grants companies a right of action against governments or the EU.

 Thank you, Mr Caspary. In response to your first question, I do believe it very likely that all or many of the groups jointly submitted this draft resolution. Nonetheless, the questions I asked are of pressing interest, including because they are accepted and considered not merely by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but by all the groups. That is why I pointed out that we need to make progress here with the negotiations. In that regard, it needs to be more than just scoping. We need to go a step further and, as Mr Lange said, also incorporate this consideration when issuing the mandate. The answers to the second and third questions I will provide to Mr Caspary in person.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with this compromise, the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, are asking for Parliament’s consent for a reform that would abolish the European Union’s trade preferences for a number of poor countries. This fact is concealing itself behind the debate about the criteria into which we have already entered, including today. A completely arbitrary limit value has been set on per capita average income, which just happens to exceed USD 4 000 per annum. However, this value tells us nothing about the real distribution of income in many countries. In particular, the inconsistency of development processes in each country is not covered. Do you recall the Treaty of Lisbon? The elimination of poverty is a coherent goal of the foreign policy of the European Union. Your reform will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in countries like Ecuador, thus tipping women, predominantly, back into poverty. I believe that the motivation is clear, and it has even been publicly acknowledged by the rapporteur. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Fjellner for his openness and the mutual respect shown during the debate on this. Countries such as Ecuador are to be forced to conclude a direct free trade agreement with the European Union. We have seen the simple peddling of the argument that the reform aims to help the least developed countries. You are aware of that yourself, as trade potentials will not shift to the weak, but to the strong. Mr Lange, every major development organisation, this House’s Committee on Development, as well as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and numerous national trade unions have leant their support to the amendments and the trend through which we are seeking to revise this regulation. We will bring these amendments up again with Members in plenary, and I strongly urge you to support these amendments and thus help ensure that the European Union does not withdraw from the global fight against poverty. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– Mr President, the Policy Department’s study ‘EU macro-financial assistance: a critical assessment’ provides a useful and telling assessment of MFA operations so far. It shows the impact of both the scope and the volume of the loans and grants to be very marginal in many cases. The new procedures under the Treaty of Lisbon make the process of applying MFA more cumbersome. The consent of Parliament is now necessary for all applications of the MFA, and we understand the willingness of the Commission to simplify the procedures. Mr Kazak – whom I thank, on my own behalf and that of our shadow rapporteur, for his cooperation – proposes to apply the delegated acts procedure in respect of eligible countries and granting assistance to particular countries. As a group, we support this view. Our group is not against the imposition of some conditions but they must be the right ones. Our group considers it a serious mistake to continue to impose, within the framework of the MFA, the same conditions imposed by the IMF. We need to address these challenges, in particular in the light of the current financial and economic crisis. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our citizens are increasingly losing confidence in the European Union and the application of the law practised by its policies in many areas, Mr Martin’s own-initiative report can only be welcomed, and I would like to expressly lend my group’s support to this own-initiative report. It concerns taking further practical steps to assert the right explicitly laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Parliament’s task of exercising political control. I therefore do not agree with the previous speaker that we should not expand the right of inquiry or the rights of the European Parliament in this way, for how can and should Article 226 intervene in practice, in concrete terms, if it becomes necessary to set up temporary committees of inquiry in order to uncover and put a stop to, and I quote:  ‘alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law’. (DE)
 We need a permanent inquiry procedure that functions in real terms, is transparent and creates transparency. Inquiry proceedings do indeed have an important role to play in a parliamentary democracy. They allow parliaments to examine the facts independently and autonomously where they consider this necessary in order to perform their constitutional task of representing citizens. I believe this to be urgently necessary, particularly in the situation which the European Union finds itself at present. One final thought to close: I agree with those Members who have said that minority conclusions are urgently needed. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the coming week, the Chinese Minister for Commerce, Chen Deming, will be holding official talks with Mr De Gucht in Brussels. In this respect, this debate is taking place at the right time and the Chinese will be paying considerable attention to the expectations and opinions of the European Parliament. Ms de Sarnez, despite the constructive cooperation and the many individual points in your report which were correct and which I would like to thank you for, I cannot vote in favour of your report. Everyday life in businesses in Europe, the closure of traditional manufacturing plants, for example, in the textile industry and in the new industries of the future, such as the solar sector, the supply of raw materials to both these huge markets, the challenges involved in global trade and the complexity of current economic policy, in particular against the background of the financial, economic and structural crisis, the challenges of climate change and the current logic of production and growth all show that the report falls short of what we would like to see. We are taking too small a step, even if we perhaps do not need a new major leap forwards. We cannot simply continue our trade and economic policy as before with China and with other so-called emerging markets. We must investigate our business relations, address the contradictions and problems openly and establish clear contractual terms. However, all of this can only take place in the context of developing a common, agreed strategy for cooperation in a genuinely globalised world economy. To achieve this, we need intelligent, forward-looking initiatives. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Aung San Suu Kyi, one of the most symbolic political figures in the world, is once again taking part in the process of shaping her country. The overwhelming support which she received during her election to parliament clearly demonstrates that she carries the hopes of the Burmese people. However, I would like to make it clear that the parliament to which she was elected does not have the power to take the country in a different direction from that planned by the military. In addition, the generals have adopted a constitution which guarantees that they retain control over parliament in future. President Thein Sein could give a clear indication of how serious his desire for change is by not attempting to force the newly elected members to swear to support this obsolete constitution before they are allowed to take up their mandate. I am happy to acknowledge that a series of positive changes have taken place over the last two years. However, I agree with all my fellow Members that the country still has a long way to go. The spotlight on Aung San Suu Kyi must not blind us to the fate of other political prisoners, to the ongoing military action against parts of the population, to the misery of the refugees and to the wealth of a small elite in a desperately poor country. Is real change now on the way or will there be new setbacks? My group supports the call from Aung San Suu Kyi to suspend EU sanctions, but not to lift them permanently. This would give her country the opportunity to overcome poverty and encourage the military to continue along the road to democracy. However, it would also allow us to show that the European Parliament remains vigilant and that a return to dictatorship would have serious consequences. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Füle, my group has been following the developments in Iceland over the last few years and the ongoing and intensive accession negotiations with great attention and sympathy. We see Iceland primarily from the perspective of a country with a very small population which has not only succeeded in bringing about social change in recent years, but has also drawn conclusions about how to resolve the causes of the crisis and taken the necessary measures. We believe that Iceland is very much on the right track. Therefore, my group is also asking itself whether Iceland can bring its experiences, for example, in the area of sustainable energy policy, into the accession process and ultimately into Europe. Some of the solutions it has put in place go far beyond the measures taken to overcome the crisis in the EU. That is what the accession negotiations are essentially about. This presupposes that the negotiations are not only transparent and constructive, but are also on an equal footing as far as their content is concerned and do not have a predetermined outcome. Some of my fellow Members would like to believe that the domestic political situation in Iceland and the accession process are not efficient in political terms. However, the key political consideration is something quite different. The population of Iceland, which, by the way, is very pro-European, because many Icelanders have studied and worked in Europe, has high expectations of the negotiations. Nevertheless, the people of Iceland do not want accession at any price. In the end, they have to weigh up the results. This is a highly democratic process which we should welcome and support. I would like to thank Mr Preda for his very balanced report, but on the basis of these considerations, my group will be abstaining from voting. Why is this? Against the background of what I have said, the report contains points that we cannot support. Two examples of these are that if we accept, as my group does, that the accession process will remain open until the final evaluation of the results of the negotiations, we cannot behave now as if the decision had already been made. Secondly, the report calls in paragraph 5 for a reduction in the state’s influence on the banking sector. However, Iceland had particular challenges to overcome in this area, which we must not ignore. Instead, we must assess what has been done and make use of the findings. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address my words expressly to Mr Swoboda. Your first motion for a resolution was pleasantly balanced and specifically unemotional with regard to what can be said following the presidential elections. In signing the European Convention on Human Rights, the Russian leadership made a voluntary commitment that it is not fulfilling. These elections, too, were once again not fair or free of fraud. Even a EUR 300 million investment in surveillance technology by the government did not solve a problem that can only be solved at a political level. These are the sober facts that do not leave us, as a partner, indifferent. They also highlight the contradictory nature of a Russian society, which, as everyone can see, is nevertheless changing. This is something we should welcome and support, because emerging democracies thrive on efforts to develop and change, and also on protests. Russia is becoming normal. I therefore consider a number of the conclusions drawn by some of my colleagues here in Parliament to be politically wrong. There must be no compromises in the text here, either. This House must finally decide what line it wants to take. At the ‘Russia after the Elections’ event yesterday, organised by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I discovered that some Members are of the opinion that Russia is no longer normal. Was it ever normal? They believe it represents a potential danger and that we cannot simply carry on as before, but must now finally take a different course. I would just like to say something about this. Those who want to think in terms of escalation spirals should now explain how far they want to go with this and, moreover, not only in terms of where that leaves our partnership. For all the justified criticism and all of the differences, partnership for me means, above all, a balance in terms of our common interests, and, at least in my mother tongue, partnership and subordination are not synonyms. People who advocate this path are also saying, as far as I can see, that they do not believe in the power of society to change and that they have not taken note of the changes in Russian society, to which, incidentally, the reports of the election observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) also refer, as here is where alternatives to the Putin-steered democracy are being sought. All of this must, ultimately, be discussed in political terms. The dynamism that some people are currently developing here in this House following the elections is something that I consider to be disconcerting, however. In my view, it cannot be reconciled with the political dignity and self-perception of a House that stands for plurality in Europe if representatives of part of the Russian opposition here in Strasbourg were able, unchallenged, to discredit the alternative presidential candidates by describing them simply as ‘Putin’s pigs’, when these candidates, without rectification of the election fraud, received the vote of more than 25 million citizens in Russia. Despite knowledge to the contrary, these same people have been speaking for weeks in this House, likewise unchallenged, of the possible bloodshed caused by Mr Putin and of potential revolutions. All I can say is that it is not the clear majority in this House that is deliberately taking the wrong course in its criticism of the elections in Russia. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, it is important that on the second occasion in only a short period of time, the European Parliament is condemning the abuse of children who are used as cheap labour or slaves. We are in favour of this agreement. Nevertheless, in the Committee on International Trade, we had a shameful debate about whether we should condemn only forced child labour or also child labour under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In two areas, we may be forced to take a step backwards and, therefore, we need to resolve the issues involved. Mr Sturdy, recital E, which has been tabled by your group, gives the impression that the hard work done by children on the cocoa plantations is harmless. These children are being deprived of the opportunity to take part in education and their future is being taken away from them. We should delete this paragraph. Ms Köstinger and the other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which tabled recital D, want Parliament to turn a blind eye to the fact that children are being abducted and sold in West Africa to do hard and dangerous forced labour on the cocoa plantations. This is the appalling reality in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in particular, as has already been mentioned. I recommend that you watch the documentary ‘The Dark Side of Chocolate’, which reveals that a child costs EUR 230. The children are being abducted from Mali and the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are more than 12 000 children without relations working on the Ivorian plantations. The next time we eat chocolate, we should specifically ask ourselves how many children have suffered to give us this pleasure. We must take a much more decisive approach to combating this problem.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, discussions between the partners about what annoys them and about what changes would increase the common ground between them are an undoubted part of strategic partnerships. More than one area of this kind exists. Therefore, it is increasingly surprising that this House is content simply to give a mutual confirmation of its values. The results of the poll in Russia yesterday should be making us think much more carefully about the situation. The poll showed that the Russian population wants a modern country with a stable economy which is more than just an exporter of raw materials. However, only 7% of the population believes that the EU is prepared to help with the necessary reconstruction. This figure has not only halved, but is also particularly low in areas which are in close contact with the EU. We should be discussing the related issues here, including democratic values, involvement in society, the prospects of the election and the emergence of a political and civil society in the Russian Federation, particularly against the background of the contradictory experiences of the Russian people during the Yeltsin era. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, a strategic partnership must involve a balance of interests on key issues, including people’s living conditions, business relationships based on equal opportunities and the joint challenges that we have to resolve. ‘Strategic’ means giving priority to our common interests as part of this balance. It also means making concrete achievements, ensuring that the political decision-making processes are transparent for everyone, and explaining the electoral procedures. We agree on the fact that nothing can happen without joint security. However, it is difficult to understand why joint security is not being established jointly. The proposals for discussion have been put on the table, including by the EU. The next summit must deal with these proposals. It must come to a binding agreement that the money used to buy more weapons would be better spent on the specific processes for establishing the modernisation partnership. This is in the interest of both sides and also in the interest of our citizens, who want to have their fair share of the economic progress. A prospering economy and a fair society will ultimately make obsolete the arrogant behaviour which comes with power. A society of this kind needs the competence and commitment of all its citizens. The Russian demonstrators made this clear to their government in Bolotnaya Square on Saturday and called for concrete change. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I took over this dossier, I quite honestly did not expect to be negotiating it intensively for more than two years. In my view, that is certainly difficult to explain to the general public, both to citizens within the EU and also to people in our partner countries. It is worth noting that, with regard to the negotiations on the actual content and the tasks of the instrument, it was possible to reach an agreement in a few months. What caused the negotiations to drag on so long was the interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon in respect of the delegated acts and the refusal of some large Member States to actually allow Parliament greater powers of scrutiny. The Council and the European Parliament agreed at an early stage to thoroughly revise the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. We planned to release up to EUR 348 million for cooperation in the fields of science, academic exchanges – including the Erasmus Mundus programme – culture, environmental protection and renewable energy sources and the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration was to be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. That remains the case, but the delay has meant that it will only be possible for a considerably smaller amount to be invested by the end of the current financial framework. That is particularly regrettable because, with the new ICI+, projects in developing countries can also be financed, and this involves projects that do not fall within the general definition of development assistance measures, for example sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America. In the amended regulation we have made clear reference to the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It is clearly stated for whom and for what purpose the additional funds are to be used according to the intentions of the legislators. In the developing countries listed in Annex II, at least 5% of the funds are to be spent in the area of public diplomacy. In specific terms, that means the promotion of dialogue with civil society with regard to the character and fundamental values of the European Union, namely democracy, respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms. At least 20% of the funds are to be invested in the promotion of direct relations between the citizens of the European Union and the partner countries. In addition to an emphasis on academic exchange and the mobility of students, this also involves the interlinking of economic, social and cultural players. At least 50% of the funds are to be spent on the interlinking of economic activities, with the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. The funds are to go mainly to partner countries which comply with the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation and which are involved in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is a new element. With regard to cooperation in the energy sector, the Commission is in any case required to concentrate in particular on cooperation in the area of renewable energy. For the purpose of the minutes and for the information of the Commission and the supervisory authorities: this instrument is expressly not to be used to provide hidden subsidies for the operation of a European telephone company in Colombia or any other country in Latin America. I consider it extremely important and necessary to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. We in Parliament will continually monitor this. For this purpose, we have enshrined in this instrument a special reporting obligation on the part of the Commission – this is a success too. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulation is in line with the spirit of the legislators. In the past the Commission has unfortunately often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. We therefore wanted to enshrine the delegated acts in this instrument and to demand our role and duty as legislators with a right of veto. Therefore, in the interests of those who benefit from the support programme, we did not in the end insist on the relevant wording, but with this instrument as with all the others – and on this point I agree with the other rapporteurs – we will also fight for this democratic right in future too. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only agree with Mr Goerens’s criticism of the Council, as I too would have very much liked to have seen the Council here today. Nevertheless, after all the fine words about compromise and also the areas of disagreement listed at the end of the debate, I would like to take the opportunity to point out once again that the Commission should now submit a completely revised strategy paper for the ICI+. It would be unacceptable for us as legislators to give the instrument a completely new direction and then for the Commission to simply continue with the old strategy paper, which was drawn up even before the legislative amendment and therefore had the old ‘Global Europe’ communication as its reference document. Instead, the legislators have given the regulation a completely new tenor, namely that of a partnership approach and mutual benefit. The legislators are placing the regulation in the context of other key policy goals of the European Union, in particular coherence with development policy, the enforcement of international labour law standards and the combating of climate change. However, the strategy paper continues to ignore this intention, maintaining that the goal of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. As legislators, that was not what we aimed to achieve with this instrument and the corresponding money from taxpayers. The ICI+ is intended to be a modern cooperation programme, not a weapon of conquest. Commissioner, in my view you still have an obligation to implement the will of the legislators in future, too. We do not want to write planning and strategy papers ourselves. We have repeatedly made that clear. That is something that the Commission should continue to do. However, we will utilise our right of veto if the requirements that we have written down have been ignored. Therefore, the proposals for the new generation of financing instruments must employ the principle of the delegated acts wisely. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks there has at last been a positive signal from the US that has made the world sit up and listen. However, this signal did not come from the White House, nor from the Capitol, but from the street. With the Occupy movement, the American people have set an example of resistance against the dictates of financial capitalism that have been followed and seized upon throughout the world. Yesterday, the tents of the protesters were cleared away and numerous people were arrested by the police under the cover of darkness throughout the US in what was clearly a concerted action on the part of the mayors. That is also a signal, indicating the refusal of those in power to take up the demands of the people. However, this is precisely the demand that my group would make of a transatlantic summit. It is not the people who should be arrested, but the fraudsters who are becoming ever richer on profits from subprime credits. The summit, coming just after the G20 summit, ought to consider how wide the gap is now getting between the poor majority of the population and the super rich. The summit ought to take firm decisions concerning the prohibition of usurious interest, whether for private individuals or for entire states. It ought to open its eyes and see that 10% of the population of the United States and the Member States of the EU is now out of work. A quarter of young people have no prospects, and in many regions the figure is even higher than 40%. The financial markets suck the necessary investment capital out of the real economy and out of the national exchequers and deprive them of profits. These enormous problems must be addressed at the summit. To solve these problems we need a new high-quality partnership for cooperation between the US Congress, the European Parliament and the parliaments of the EU Member States in order to define common approaches for the legislation that is urgently needed. An expanded TLD would also be the appropriate forum for addressing further differences between the EU and the US, whether this is – using the list of topics that you mentioned – in peace policy, climate policy or in connection with rights to privacy. As Mr Bütikofer said, the resolution is a long way from achieving this. As a group, therefore, we cannot give the resolution our backing. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, like many of my fellow Members, I would also like to say that we need to be honest and admit that the central task for the Commission in 2012 is nothing less than holding together the European Union. We need to take a joint approach to developing it further. We need more Europe. We must stick together in the interest of the citizens and we must not allow individual Member States to be exposed to attacks from financial capitalism. However, more Europe must not mean less democracy. In 2012, we will undoubtedly have to lay the foundations for the future development of the European Union, which will perhaps come close to being a state. However, in this Europe which resembles a state, decisions must not be made by decree by the Council and the Commission. The groundwork carried out by the Commission for the convention in 2012 must not result in the citizens of Europe and their parliaments being disenfranchised. Instead, we need a more democratic Europe with a focus on peace, environmental change and social progress. Do you not realise, Mr Barroso, that you and the Commission are increasingly being regarded by the people of Greece, Portugal and Italy as their enemy? The Council has succeeded in making you the scapegoat. Brussels is ordering the privatisation of state assets, cuts in wages and pensions, and the removal of protection against dismissal. This is all pure neoliberalism. Stop, Mr Barroso! You must finally turn the Commission into the ally of the citizens. You must defend people against the effects of greed and join with us in 2012 in bringing an end to the business model that has driven entire states to the brink of ruin with extortionate interest rates. You must stop feeding the predators. Instead, you must channel the funds into urgently needed investments in the future and make the financial transaction tax your touchstone. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, what we are discussing here relates to international economic cooperation. We often discuss the financial crisis and rescuing the banks and the euro. Incredible sums of money have been made available that should have been enough to boost employment throughout the world and thereby conquer hunger. We talk far too little about the people whose real existence the crisis has hit. The banks that we are to rescue have driven millions of people into unemployment through their speculation whilst also, at the same time, irresponsibly gambling with people’s pension funds. With the American Jobs Act, President Obama is seeking to finally put the fate of these people back at the heart of politics. His idea of removing financial burdens from businesses that take on new employees is a good one. European policy should learn from the example that the United States is setting. The non-policy of strangling the life out of the economy through lunatic austerity measures must be brought to an end. In difficult times like these, I also give my firm backing to the use of public procurement resources to promote local production. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, whoever it is sitting over there, I urge you to use the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council in December to tackle the issue of unemployment in a concerted manner in this context and to prevent a downward spiral, while counselling a joint new start for economic, employment and social policy. Be sure that the European Parliament will be very actively involved in the transatlantic dialogue between legislators. The Occupy Wall Street movement has not only earned the support of millions of Americans; it will, I hope, also act as an inspiration for the population of Europe. Helmut Scholz,

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Caspary, I acknowledge the fact that, as rapporteur, you have shown yourself within your own group to be thoroughly open to the demand for a modern trade policy with this report. Paragraph 5 of your report in particular emphasises the fact, at last, that trade policy requires coherence with a great many other policy areas as well as future viability, and I expressly support your call for a thorough revision of the trade strategy by Commissioner De Gucht. Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of this report then falls back into the old way of thinking. You want to promote the interests of the EU instead of establishing partnerships. You support an aggressive market access strategy by the Commission, which would weaken the development potential of other countries. You want to use whatever means necessary to secure access to raw materials for European enterprises instead of finally offering fair prices and providing assistance for the development of manufacturing industries. We will vote against this old way of thinking, because the consequence of continuing with this old strategy will, above all, be the extension of the spiral of poverty in most parts of the world. That is short-sighted, also because it will ultimately harm Europe. How do you actually imagine it will end if we pursue competition for the raw materials of the world by aggressive means? Where will we be in 2050? Will all of the states in the world then have a raw materials management strategy like that of Norway? Will it have been possible to develop manufacturing industries? Will Europe have helped them to do this in an environmentally sound way and to create respectable jobs? Europe’s future lies in a smart trade policy that aims to strengthen its partners and which recognises that combating poverty is a prerequisite for its own survival. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I have a question for Commissioner De Gucht. I have just been appointed as a European Parliament standing rapporteur on trade relations with China, as well as on relations between the EU and Ecuador and Bolivia. I would like to ask you two questions regarding these two complexes. Firstly, what is your projection for the development of trade relations between the EU and China by the year 2020, and what are the current issues, or even agreements, in EU-China trade talks? Secondly, you informed yesterday’s Council on Foreign Affairs and Trade that the multiparty agreement with Colombia and Peru remains open for signature by Ecuador and Bolivia. Do you want those two countries to simply sign the negotiated text which is, as you well know, subject to well-founded criticism from trade unions and a number of economists? Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I can agree with your remark concerning the last issue, but that means that if Ecuador wants to have a chapter on trade and cooperation included, as is just now under discussion, and also the specific needs of the new raw materials and public services policy pursued by Bolivia are to be included, then I think we have to come to the point where we have to add this point to the negotiations as well; so not just to simply sign or not sign, but to reopen the understanding of the agreement itself.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this agreement, as a result of which Palestinian agricultural products will now actually be placed on an equal footing with products from other, recognised states in the Mediterranean. I expressly agree with the rapporteur – and I would like to thank her for her work – when she says that this Agreement can help, to a certain degree, to support and strengthen the Palestinian economy, which is currently in crisis, irrespective of the aspects of this Agreement that are still unresolved, to which my fellow Members have referred. How is a permanent peace solution with Israel to be possible if there is no self-supporting economic development in the future state of Palestine, which also is and must be the basis for further democratisation and an embedding of Palestinian society in the region as a whole – I would like to emphasise this point – for dealing with such complex problems as demographic issues, job creation, issues relating to water supply, the construction of housing, and so on, in a constructive and positive way? I also see this as an important signal in view of the current debate in the United Nations with regard to the long overdue recognition of the state of Palestine. Trade policy – and this is specifically addressed to you – can create specific circumstances here that would signify a tangible improvement in living conditions for the local people. That also involves us taking on specific responsibility for the Arab Spring this autumn. This Agreement can surely only be a first step towards comprehensive trade cooperation as partners. In light, in particular, of the important global political decision, however, I would also like, here in plenary, to explicitly express my amazement at the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Up until just before the vote in committee, it threatened to reject the Agreement. As the price for its consent in the Committee on International Trade, it forced the deletion from Parliament’s explanatory statement of the reference to the settlements and blockades by Israel being partly to blame for the poverty and unemployment in Palestine. Shutting our eyes to reality is not a valid position to take, and the facts and challenges still remain. The same applies to the question of the deletion of the passage relating to the circumvention of the rules of origin by Israeli manufacturers. We will not solve the problem by not allowing a spade to be called a spade. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, the resolution that will be passed by the European Parliament gives you a clear mandate in this critical phase of the Doha negotiations: you must press for a positive interim result at multilateral level in Geneva that will contribute to a reduction in the poverty suffered in the world. Everyone gathered here today recognises the status quo, which is why we must have an eye to the future – as Mr Taylor has just said: do you remember the start of these talks? The Doha Round was instigated 10 years ago in the shadow of the attacks in New York and the intention was to contribute to an improvement in living conditions in developing countries by further developing the WTO, thus eliminating the basis for the propaganda of hatred. However, the Commission’s negotiators and those of its competitors are mainly concentrating on the opening up of the global markets for services and penetration into previously protected sectors of general public interest. Developing countries were able to come together within the WTO to prevent this opening up from being forced upon them. In turn, you responded by switching the emphasis to the conclusion of bilateral agreements that enabled you to pursue your chief interests more effectively. This approach has patently failed to help reduce poverty. It actually threatens the establishment of a system of fair trade rules with worldwide validity under the umbrella of the WTO. For this reason, my group urgently calls on you to return to the primacy of multilateral agreement. The least you should do in Geneva is to obtain an agreement for the so-called least developed countries package, which would bring improvements for the world’s poorest. We would also call on you to withdraw the Commission’s threat to abandon the promise to abolish the EU’s export subsidies for agricultural produce should the Doha Round fail. In view of the present catastrophic famine in East Africa and the increasingly difficult situation of the farmers – not just in the developing countries, but there in particular – it is actually necessary to speed up the abolition of export subsidies.

 Madam President, in light of the scope to act that we are afforded as Parliament, we really have to ask, ladies and gentlemen, whether we, too, have sufficient legitimacy for our actions here. Mr Duff’s report – and I very much welcome the many years of work that he has carried out – puts forward specific proposals for strengthening the European element. Some of these will clearly not receive majority support, but he is taking the right approach and it deserves broad support and a public debate, including outside this Chamber. In our group, too, there were heated debates about the specific proposals in the report. This reflects the divergent interests in, and experience with, the European Union. On one point there is agreement. Parliament is not the only place for discussing and taking decisions concerning democracy. Therefore, I give my clear support to the approach taken in the report, which I believe is the right one, and to the report’s call, right from the outset, to go well beyond the negotiating mandate towards the Council. Citizens must be given their own voice in this process and the European political parties must be active in this regard. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, it is not the first time that we have discussed the Arab countries and the upheavals there. While we are debating the developments that have taken place from Syria to Morocco, in my opinion, Parliament is also reappraising its own past, in other words, the cooperation that was at least tolerated between the European Union and countries which we rightly refer to today as having autocratic regimes and whose internal structures we are concerned about. This is a good thing. However, I cannot help but get the impression that we have once again started to relax in the supposed certainty that everything is under control and everything will be all right. The thing which I personally find impossible to deal with is that we are continuing to comment on political processes, but we are still not prepared to put these developments in their national and regional social context and to investigate the causes of these changes. We must finally stop applying double standards in our foreign policy and also in our democratic dealings with one another. We should talk about the interrelationships between EU Neighbourhood Policy and EU policy on the failure to resolve the Palestinian conflict. I very much welcome your commitment to the Quartet. We should discuss the fact that the war against Colonel Gaddafi’s autocratic regime, which some EU Member States and NATO are involved in, is already having dramatic economic consequences in Tunisia. The outflow of capital, Tunisians returning home to look for work, migrants, a collapse in the country’s income from tourism and in its trade relationships are just some of the issues. This war is also playing into the hands of the powers in the military and the political elite in Egypt who want to return to the previous regime. We are now dealing not just with new problems and no longer only with old problems. Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, we need a fundamental political and economic reorientation of the European Union’s foreign policy activities. I believe that this has become clear during the course of this debate. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations with Canada are being conducted with a country that has a strong economy and a highly developed legal system. It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate, if not conceal, an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court. Why ever should an ordinary court not decide on compensation in cases of doubt? Which courts do you, as the Commission, not have any trust in whatsoever? Is it the Canadian courts or those in the European Union? Do you not see that, with this part of the agreement, you would be discriminating against the local undertakings? As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission’s approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a ‘negative list’. This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open. We want to retain public services. I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada’s social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter. The European Parliament is also calling for the protection of workers, payment of overtime, minimum wages and rejection of social dumping. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now almost a year since the people of Pakistan suffered devastating floods. We all have very close ties with the people of this stricken country. What is scandalous, however, is the fact that the negotiations in the WTO are still dragging on, and that alone makes it clear that this form of trade facilitation is not suitable to be used as an emergency aid measure. My group has repeatedly called on the Commission to put forward a plan B in order to be able to help the people of Pakistan quickly and permanently to rebuild their country. No alternative solution has been presented, however. Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council, which it is only too familiar with. Otherwise, it would seem as if the difficult negotiations in the WTO are being used as an excuse for the lack of action. You knew as well as we did that these negotiations would be difficult before they even started and you probably also already knew this when some of the foreign ministers from Germany and other Member States sent you on this mission. After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection. It is precisely this status advantage that enables Bangladesh to import primary products from Pakistan, to process them and then export them to Europe. It is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance. However, we cannot in all honesty expect approval for our desire to help Pakistan at the expense of one of the poorest countries in the world. By doing so, we will ultimately damage ourselves, too, and indeed we will be doing this on the eve of the presentation of the new Commission draft on the revision of our system of trade preferences. My solution to this problem is therefore as follows: place the focus on direct aid for the reconstruction following the floods and take immediate action instead of losing in the negotiations in Geneva. After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the motions for resolutions that the European Parliament has been presented with make it clear to all groups that Parliament – as has already been emphasised – does not feel it is sufficiently informed about the specific status of the negotiations. I am therefore grateful for the more detailed information that we have been given today. The questions from the left side of this House in particular deal directly with the concerns of the people in Europe, but also in India, and these are concerns for their own social and economic situation and the prospects of workers and those looking for work, including in the EU Member States. As we know, the devil is in the detail, so we would like to know the following, Commissioner: what are the specific subjects of the negotiations when it comes to public invitations to tender in the services sector or in connection with labour migration? What text is on the table with regard to intellectual property rights? What is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture? By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world’s poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies. We want to examine whether European local authorities, hospitals or ministries are, in future, to be obliged to make calls for tenders in which Indian companies can also be included. We want to know whether the agreement will regulate the conditions of entry into the Member States of the European Union of Indian nurses or carers for the elderly, including the length of stay and recognition of qualifications. We want to know whether the agreement text will put small-scale farmers and fishermen in India at risk and whether European steel workers are threatened with redundancy because Indian capital will, in future, be able to be invested freely in the purchase of companies in the EU as a result of the agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, just one topic should be the focus of attention when the summit is held between the European Union and Japan at the end of this month: the disaster that has devastated the people of Japan as a result of earthquakes, the tsunami and continuing radioactive contamination, and the concrete role that can be played by the EU, its Member States and individual citizens in helping to deal with the resulting problems in the short, medium and long term. That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people. We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster – particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan. The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy. The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident. For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle. In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement. Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides. That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan. For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work and for trying, in the spirit of the European Parliament, to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides, and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis. This is not a simple issue. It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States with regard to social, economic and employment policy, weighing up the interests of financial groups, big business and economic enterprises, on the one hand, and those of the trade unions and workers on the other. That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen’s should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament. For this reason, I hope that tomorrow’s vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr Füle, Mr Siwiec, thank you for devoting yourself to this subject. Parliament’s almost unanimous opinion is that Neighbourhood Policy has not produced the expected results. I agree with that. However, I do not agree with the analysis of the causes. The results do not meet our expectations because we have not focused on the interests which we have in common with our neighbours. Instead, we have concentrated on our own interests and on our ideas of how neighbouring countries should develop. Quite obviously, what we need is a different approach. We need a policy which makes cooperation between both sides a central principle and which respects the sovereign right of the citizens in the partner countries to shape their future without outside interference. The content of the policy must focus on our common European challenges and transform partnership policy into a permanent tool for genuine cooperative discussions and for identifying solutions to joint problems. We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is taking a serious-minded and practical approach to the issue of the democratisation of European decision-making processes. As Mrs Giannakou’s report shows, this approach also involves the further development of European parties, which, although they have been an everyday political reality in Europe for many years, until now have not been equal partners and players in terms of their democratic influence on EU policy. We need political parties at EU level too that are firmly rooted in the societies they represent and that can play a strong role in the elections to the European Parliament and in establishing European openness, based on internal democratic structures and regulations. With regard to this particular report, I must say that I would have liked the rapporteur to have shown a great deal more courage by using the Parliament’s right of initiative to take a truly significant step in developing the political system and the party system in the European Union. This is a step that many citizens have been waiting for and that will encourage them to get involved. The interlocking European and national decision-making levels and the relations between the political parties could have been addressed more clearly as a common factor that is transparent and open to influence. The European Parliament should now decisively call on the Commission and Council to take the initiative in this regard. I would expect constructive cooperation from the Commission and Council.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate. However, I would like to mention two aspects. The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade. The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters. Therefore, my group will not support these amendments. Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology. This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers. We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important aspect of international trade policy very late in the day. Given its importance, I would have preferred the House to be full, with all the seats occupied. The European Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a major achievement of European trade policy. It opens up our market to the poorest countries in the world for all types of goods except arms. It also gives developing countries trade concessions on a whole range of products. GSP+ is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights, labour standards and protecting the environment. However, the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly. Over the years, the European Parliament, partner countries, companies and non-governmental organisations have made important suggestions for improving the system. The whole world is now waiting for the Commission to issue its proposal on the much-needed revision of the system. The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010. The Commission has not delivered on time and its failure to do so has left the countries involved and companies both inside and outside the EU in a dangerous state of uncertainty. The existing regulation must now be revised. You are attempting to rescue the situation by means of a transitional regulation and this is what we will be voting on tomorrow, that is on Thursday. The transitional regulation is simply an extension. It does not change anything, it does not improve anything and it does not implement the new requirements resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and, as the rapporteur, I have felt the same. It is the obligation of the Members of this Parliament to ensure that the rights, the duties and also the powers granted to the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe by the Treaty of Lisbon are respected. It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries. In order to protect the EU’s partners from the consequences of a long-drawn-out procedure, I suggested initially to the Committee on International Trade that only those elements of the regulation should be amended which are necessary to allow Parliament to fulfil its new role. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that I also believe a general redrafting of the GSP and GSP+ schemes is needed. During the intensive meetings with the Council and the Commission on the legal issues resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon which affect the transitional regulation, Parliament finally decided to take a big leap of faith. At this point, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to the chair of the Committee on International Trade, Professor Moreira, for his untiring efforts as mediator and also to you, Mr De Gucht, for the Commission’s assurance that key amendments, in particular with regard to informing and involving Parliament, would be addressed in practice. Therefore, we decided to drop all our amendments, in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible. We did this primarily in the interests of our partners and of the companies which are affected. The Commission’s assurance includes a promise in future to inform the European Parliament in full, immediately and at the same time as the Council about work relating to essential aspects of the GSP and about all developments and to share all documents relating to the GSP. The Commission also guarantees that the European Parliament will be notified about any suspension of preferences, in accordance with Article 16(3), about withdrawals, including the corresponding investigation reports from the Commission, in accordance with Article 17, and about safeguard decisions, in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, before they come into force. We welcome the tabling of Omnibus 1 and the Commission’s readiness to enter into an in-depth discussion of the proposals which it has made in Omnibus 1. At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently. Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation. We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament’s parliamentary rights. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for working together so constructively. Now that we have finally agreed on the formal aspects of the transitional regulation, I would like to make use of this debate to explain briefly some of the requirements for the future regulation. The new version of the regulation should have the following basic objectives: 1. To increase the efficiency of the system; 2. To develop rules that will provide for a better regulated reform process in which the involvement of the beneficiaries is guaranteed; 3. To ensure that the regulation gives due weight to the task of democratic control which Parliament is required to perform. This includes proposals from the Committee on Development. The new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) should be a clearer and more transparent system. I would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin. The rules of origin and the administrative procedures that accompany them are one of the main reasons why the trade preferences granted by the GSP are being underused, particularly by the least developed countries. In the current version of the system, the rules of origin often prevent preferences that exist on paper from having a positive impact. I have just come back from the Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva and this problem was very high up on the list of issues discussed there. In my opinion, the EU should campaign within the WTO for the preference system to be given priority as part of its work on harmonising the rules of origin. My second point concerns the partner countries. Here I feel that it is particularly important for us to develop more straightforward criteria. The Gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion. As already mentioned, we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively. My third point is about technical assistance. Preferences alone are not enough. We need to increase the impact of the system and improve the rate of utilisation of the GSP by providing technical assistance. This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole. I would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach. I will be happy to continue working with the Commission on the basis of today’s assurances. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, only last autumn, the European Parliament specifically welcomed the fact that the Heads of State or Government of the European Union had explicitly recognised, in a statement from the Madrid Summit, the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural resources and to control their use. The statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criteria. The summit was attended by Latin American countries, but the same laws apply to China and other states. The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) has led to serious environmental damage in China, as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere. This must not continue. We need an international agreement. China and other potential producers need our expertise and technology transfer in order to ensure that their mining processes are environmentally friendly and that their miners can work in much greater safety. China is also interested in investing in high-tech production facilities for processing REEs, because it does not just want to be a supplier of raw materials. The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here. A modern raw materials policy must be characterised by partnership. At the same time, you must put the emphasis on developing improved recycling and substitution technologies, because in future, the metals found in REEs will become even rarer: too rare simply to use them once.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement signed in October 2010, which has been assigned the attribute by the Commission and the Council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the EU and a highly industrialised state, the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98% in the next five years. The trade exchange between the EU and Korea is supposed to double in the medium term and that – so it is said – will speed up economic growth and the creation of jobs and prosperity. My group and I have justified doubts about this prediction. Quite apart from the mantra of the role of free trade as a kind of saviour of the global economy that is currently in a precarious state, which is also reflected in the Free Trade Agreement itself, it is not clear from this agreement whether it will, or will able to, help us deal with the global challenges arising as a result of climate change and the necessary fundamental economic restructuring. What are the efficiency criteria and what are the free trade criteria? At the same time, Commissioner, the Free Trade Agreement that has been concluded hardly contains any references to sustainability for the future, oriented change or international economic cooperation. An agreement is being concluded in which the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation are still being contravened. (The President cut off the speaker.) Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term. We plan to jointly allocate up to EUR 348 million to cooperation in areas such as science, academic exchanges – including Erasmus Mundus –, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy, as well as the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration should be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. The new aspect is that with what is known as ICI Plus, projects in developing countries can now also be financed – and specifically projects that do not fall under the general definition of development aid measures. These include projects and measures such as sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America – a completely new element. In the current times, when the EU has a greater responsibility to realign its cooperation in partnership with a growing number of states, allowing self-determined development has a particular part to play in this. The recast of the regulation needs to clearly mark the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It clearly states who can obtain financial assistance, for what purposes and on what terms. Another new element of this instrument is that the regulation specifies that the allocation of funding must ensure that the partner countries comply with the core working standards of the International Labour Organisation and that they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an important contribution to the international fight against climate change. Equally important, the rule of law and human dignity in work are elevated to cooperation objectives. As we are going into the second reading, allow me to restate that I consider it essential to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. In the plenary vote at first reading it was decided – albeit by a narrow majority – that none of the funds allocated to development aid thus far should be devoted to ICI Plus. We are going into the second reading with an accelerated rapprochement on this, as on all the financing instruments. Following successful compromise negotiations between Council and the European Parliament we have adapted ICI Plus to the challenges of the future. All the matters of substance have been approved by a majority in plenary. So far, so good – or so it would seem. However, it remains undecided how we will deal in future with the division of powers between the two legislative bodies of the EU resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly in the area of communitarised international trade policy. The issue at stake here is democracy, and specifically what are known as delegated acts – which is something on which the European Parliament and the Commission and Council continue to have differing views. What is this all about? We want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulations is in accordance with the spirit of the legislator. In the past the Commission has unfortunately too often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us a new role and duty as a legislator, and we demand a right of veto. The rapporteurs for the various foreign policy financing instruments, the chairs of the committees and the leaders of the groups are all agreed that we must fight for this democratic right. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conduct we have seen so far shows that not all three bodies of the European Union have yet recognised this principle. We are therefore vigorously defending our right of control today because in future the Commission must base its planning on what the legislator has laid down, not on its own communications.

rapporteur

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, you are absolutely right that the outside world does not understand why we cannot come to an agreement with the Council. The Council is not even present for this debate, which I very much regret, because that is not a good omen for the completion of the second reading. However, we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right, which are enshrined in the treaty, are not being recognised. I believe, and Mr Brok has discussed this in detail, that this is only about giving us the opportunity to intervene. Perhaps I can give one more example with regard to the content. In the Commission’s multiannual plan for my industrialised countries instrument (ICI), the reference document was not the amended regulation, but instead the Global Europe strategy. This uses language which has become obsolete since the advent of the economic crisis and the resulting trade problems when it says that the objective of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. I can only repeat that this is not what the legislators intended the instrument to achieve and they have not put aside any taxpayers’ money for this purpose. In our view, the ICI should be a modern cooperation programme and not a weapon of conquest. To give another example, this time in more blunt terms: For us, the countries of south-east Asia are not just junior partners, as the Commission has stated. As part of the cooperation with central Asia, the instrument must not focus solely on EU access to the gas reserves there. When we look at the Maghreb region and the developments in the Middle East, it is clear that we need to take a long-term, large-scale approach to cooperation. I hope that the new regulation will be future-proof. I also hope that this financing instrument will encourage exchanges on an equal footing between the EU and third countries and will help to create openness throughout the world and promote responsible support for sustainable development processes which are in the interests of citizens.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my group has not signed up to the compromise resolution on Belarus. However, I would like to make it clear that this should not be seen as an acceptance on our part of the results of the election, the arrests and the reprisals against those with differing opinions. For us, fair, transparent and democratic elections – ‘the freedom of dissenters’ to quote Rosa Luxemburg – are a basic requirement for establishing a relationship with Belarus and with all other states. This also includes the immediate release of all political detainees. However, I doubt whether sanctions are really an effective means of bringing about the immediate release of political prisoners and radical changes in the democratic system in Belarus. Sanctions have had little effect in the past in Belarus and elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, you are as well aware of this as I am. A better approach seems to me to be to confront those who hold political power with our arguments and demands in the context of a political dialogue, not to give them the opportunity to discredit the criticisms made by those in civil society by referring to external criticism, to establish a transparent political system and to coordinate our efforts with those of all our foreign policy partners in Belarus. This also seems to be more honest in relation to our own arguments, as this morning’s discussion on the Hungarian Presidency has shown. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I have two brief comments on the report: firstly, I believe it is right and good that with this report the European Parliament is getting involved in the debate on economic and monetary union. After all, this is an issue of such importance that it cannot be left to the Council alone. To date, in the management of the crisis the Council has proven to be more a stronghold of nationalism than a place where European solutions are developed. Secondly, economic and monetary union is not sufficient. During the crisis many citizens viewed the work of the European Union, Parliament, the Commission and the Council as a means of supporting the banks. Whether that is true in all cases is a moot point, but that is the experience of many citizens: the banks are being supported, while the social situation of many citizens is becoming increasingly precarious. It is not sufficient simply to talk about prosperity, as the spokesperson for the Council did. What is required is a social union that guarantees all citizens social rights. If we do not manage to achieve this, the EU will lose the support of citizens. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank my colleagues for the good work they have done together, but especially Mr Ferber. This has really been a very good, fair and open collaboration. It is not always this way, so it is much appreciated in this case. At this point I would also like to thank the non-governmental organisations. They made a significant contribution, especially in the area of food speculation. What may not be obvious, and I want to emphasise this, is that the rapporteur has also engaged in the process. It has not always been easy and comfortable. I do believe, however, that at that point it was very important and good that the non-governmental organisations were involved in working on this area. This process opened up the dry, heavy issue of financial market regulation a little to some of the people, the citizens. It does Parliament good to let such an important issue get out of this House a little. I echo what Mr Giegold said earlier. We have taken an important and good step in the area of food speculation. However, there are still a few questions with regard to omissions – there may still be a few loopholes there. Nevertheless, this will be revealed by experience and then we will have to re-work this area. I think that what we have done on high-frequency trading is very deserving of support: I – and, I believe, the majority of my Group – can wholeheartedly support it. This is also not a matter of course, but on that point we have succeeded in creating something good and practical. On commissions, I can only echo what has already been said. It also seems to me to be a point in need of a little adjustment. However, this process is not so straightforward: tomorrow there will be further amendments proposed. Let us see what the result of that is. Jürgen Klute,

Madam President, first of all, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. I think that overall, the report establishes a good position for this House in this heated debate between Parliament and the Council. From my Group’s perspective, I would point out, first and foremost, that austerity policies in recent years have obviously failed and that countries which have run such policies and are under pressure to make savings have seen a loss of growth and tax revenue but also an increase in poverty and unemployment. Cuts in the MFF would mean the continuation and entrenchment of these policies for the next seven years, as a substantial proportion of the EU budget goes back to the Member States where it is used to support economic development, research and education. For that reason, we cannot and will not vote for such cuts in the MFF. Let me take an example from history. My country, the Federal Republic of Germany, faced a similar deep-seated crisis after the Second World War. Then in 1953, the London debt agreement was adopted, which not only cancelled Germany’s debts; it also, and above all, aimed to provide clear and tangible impetus for economic growth through programmes initiated under the Marshall Plan. This helped to bring Germany out of its post-war indebtedness and paved the way for its economy to develop in the way that it has. So our view is that we cannot make cuts: we must expand the budget and develop it further, and thus ensure that growth can help us overcome this crisis. I fully support Helga Trüpel’s detailed comments about own resources and the Financial Transaction Tax. We support this position too and would welcome rather more commitment from Parliament to moving forward on the question of own resources and implementation of the Financial Transaction Tax, as this is an important issue for this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Commissioner, I basically welcome your initiative for common banking supervision in Europe. I believe that is necessary. I have a couple of questions, however. The European landscape, the EU, is dotted with a wide variety of banks: savings banks, cooperative banks, private banks, big banks. I believe that we must maintain and protect this variety, even with European supervision. I believe this is very important because many of the small banks were stable throughout the crisis and should not be sent to the wall. Secondly, I would like to say that I do not believe that supervision alone will be enough. The supervisory body must also have effective instruments to enable it to intervene in the market as necessary, even removing toxic products from the market as required. Thirdly, and lastly, however good a bank supervisory body may be, it can still do little, with the legal situation as it currently is, with regard to the shadow bank sector. This means that we still need to remain aware of the fact that only part of the problem will be resolved with such bank supervision. The problem of the shadow banks will remain. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, on our agenda this week is a legislative own-initiative report on the subject of access to basic banking services. Parliament makes clear and detailed proposals from its perspective about what the Commission’s legislative initiative could and should look like. The first specific proposal concerns the schedule. A very large majority of the members of the main committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, believes that we should not waste any more time unnecessarily on this subject. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament by January 2013. I think that we are working along the same lines as Mr Barnier. We are of the opinion that the EU must make it possible for the 30 million citizens who have not yet had a bank account of their own to become part of the normal financial system. Without a bank account, things which the rest of us take for granted soon become insoluble problems. Renting a flat, signing a contract with an electricity supplier or joining the modern world of work are almost impossible in most countries unless you have a bank account. We believe that all of this should not be allowed to fail simply because the banks are aiming to maximise their profits. To quote the report: banks also have a responsibility for society. We will only have a functioning social market economy and a modern internal market when the banks genuinely take on this responsibility. However, let us be honest about the situation. Many citizens no longer trust the EU to achieve these goals. When it comes to the crunch, as it has in the current crisis, for the majority of citizens, these are just empty words. They know that the EU is supporting the banks with large rescue packages and many of them feel as if they have been left out in the cold. At least that is the impression that more and more citizens of more and more countries in the European Union have. The report which we will be voting on tomorrow was not originally planned as an own-initiative report. If the majority of the Commissioners had stuck to the Commission’s plan, today we would be able to present the citizens with the results of the negotiations. Work could already have begun on establishing the right of consumers throughout Europe to an account or these accounts could even be a reality already. We regard the recommendation that the Commission has sent to the Member States as disappointing. Many of the responses from the Member States to the request and to the Commission’s country reports are more akin to satire than to a sensible policy which is relevant to the citizens. In order to understand this, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. The question of access to bank accounts involves business interests, which is quite normal. These are interests which could hardly be more different as far as their opportunities for influence are concerned. Therefore, politicians must be responsible for ensuring a fair and socially desirable balance of interests. That is our job as politicians and as Members of Parliament. I cannot cover all the aspects of the report here. I simply want to highlight briefly what I believe are a few key points. One of these is cost. A basic account should be provided free of charge or at least at a reasonable charge. This is what the report says. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Member States should set a mandatory upper limit. The Commission should also investigate the possibility of an EU-wide upper limit for charges on a basic account, because we will not reach our target group without clear regulations on costs. Access is another important point. We must keep the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum for consumers who rely on a basic account. Financial exclusion goes hand in hand with social exclusion. Another key point is subsidiarity. A directive would enable us to take the individual features of each country into account. We believe that the Member States would be best placed to define potential exceptions if as many of the banks as possible were covered by the directive. Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the members of the negotiating team, to the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also to Mr Barnier for our very effective and constructive collaboration. This definitely made a major contribution to the success of the report. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like once again to thank everyone very much for supporting this report. This has been made very clear. Mr Barnier, you have heard that this initiative has broad support here in Parliament. I believe it is now time for the Commission to take action. We all know that you are very committed. No one doubts your commitment. However, we also know that there is opposition to this within the Commission. Please tell the College of Commissioners what you have heard here. You can be sure that you will have our broad support on this matter. It is true that there are one or two detailed issues that still need discussing, but I feel that we were able to work together very constructively across all the groups in the compromise negotiations. I am sure that we will find solutions for the specific issues which everyone will be happy with. Finally, I would like to say that I am looking forward to continuing to work together with everyone on this subject. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2010, the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States finally acknowledged that the European Community needs a more closely coordinated financial and economic policy. At the summit, they ‘invented’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed. An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy. It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘mini jobs’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight. I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea behind the ‘two-pack’ is to provide further rights of intervention in respect of crisis countries in the euro area. The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission’s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘six-pack’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday. Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘two-pack’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès’s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option. It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax is certainly not identical to the Tobin tax that has been talked about and debated for many years, but I think it incorporates essential elements of the Tobin tax. It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis. I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets. However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate. There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level. I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success. While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here. I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions. I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here. It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.

Well, in so doing, we are merely picking up on the tax that the City of London takes on derivatives, and even if we do not consider the tax rate to be sufficient, then that by no means suggests that we do not think this project is a good one. I see no contradiction there, and it would add something into the bargain if it corresponded to what has long been the practice in the City of London. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

– This FTT plan picks up on a number of elements of the Tobin tax which has been under discussion for many years now. It is an important signal to send to citizens, markets and banks following a series of campaigns and petitions aimed at introducing an FTT at EU level. Obviously, it could have gone further. It is not sufficient to stabilise financial markets and more needs to be done, but I urge the Council to follow the citizens and do everything possible to prevent this proposal from being blocked by Member States.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that in my opinion the sections in Ms Oomen-Ruijten’s report concerning the judiciary and constitutional reform are highly successful. I would like to congratulate her on these sections. However, I also believe that far too little attention has been paid to the subject of the situation of the Kurds in Turkey. As has been said several times, there are not only hundreds of journalists in prison, but also thousands of Kurds and in particular Kurdish politicians who are members of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). Some of them are elected members of parliament. This is not the way to resolve the conflict between the Turkish Government and the Kurds. It would be good to make our position on this subject clearer in the report. Together with some other Members, we have tabled amendments for tomorrow. I will be very pleased if there is majority support for these amendments. In my opinion, it will not help if we close our eyes to what is happening at this point. The EU must make itself clearly heard with regard to this issue. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what will the citizens of Europe think of the way in which we are handling the crisis after the last summit? They will realise that the banks are receiving around EUR 1 trillion from the European Central Bank (ECB) without any conditions being imposed on them. No strings are attached to this money and the banks can use it for whatever purpose they want. In contrast, the countries that are in crisis are being gagged and forced to introduce disastrous austerity measures. The citizens of the crisis countries are having to put up with cuts in their pay, pensions and social security benefits. However, unlike Germany, the economies of these crisis countries are not dependent on exports, but on their own internal markets. It is precisely these markets which are being destroyed by the austerity policies that have been imposed. This is not the right way to get out of the crisis, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy. In political terms, the EU is being driven into a brick wall. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to start with the positive aspects. I would like to emphasise that we welcome what Mr La Via’s report says on the subject of growth, which is that the focus must be on growth. We need growth that creates jobs and that can help combat youth unemployment. We think that this is very important. I would like to highlight the fact that we welcome the points relating to research and investment in research. However, I think we need clearer statements on fighting poverty within Europe and also in the world as a whole, on a global level. Moreover, the report did not look at how we are to combat climate change. I am very critical of the opening section of the report, which concerns automatic sanctions. I think that threatening the Member States with automatic sanctions is a mistake, given that they are already in a difficult situation with regard to their budgets. We are opposed to this. However, I want to highlight one point which I think is very sensible and that is increased coordination of the budgets of the Member States and the EU using a process which has democratic legitimacy. I would like to make one final remark on the subject of cutbacks. I want to emphasise that we do not believe that budget cuts are appropriate. We have already made it clear that Croatia will be joining the EU during the course of the year. We will have a whole series of new jobs to do in the EU and we have had new supervisory bodies in place now for more than a year. We need these bodies and we need funding and staff for them, so that they can work effectively and prevent future crises. This will ensure that the expenditure is a sensible investment which will help us to save money in future. In my opinion, these are the crucial points. Most importantly, we hope that we can work to ensure that there are no budget cuts. For us, that is essential. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday. The detailed regulations are also now available. What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified? Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem. A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however. I would say to the Commission that ‘cheap’ is not the same thing as ‘good’. It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners. Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story. I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed. That is nonsense. In the face of increasing world trade, Europe’s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink. Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade. We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level. In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly. Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions. However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources. As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear. A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries. Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States. The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU. Yet what does the Council do in this situation? It curtails the Commission’s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed. If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council. Jürgen Klute,

 Madam President, Mr Šemeta, I would like to make a few comments on the tax agreement between Germany and Switzerland, as other speakers have done. Instead of stopping tax evasion and blocking the loopholes for tax evaders, which would have been sensible, the result that has been produced here is a Swiss cheese full of large holes. The proposed transition period of five months gives tax evaders plenty of time to transfer their money from Switzerland to other tax havens. As foundations and trusts are not governed by the agreement, it is also possible to transform assets which have been stashed away in Switzerland into the assets of a foundation. Forms for doing this can be obtained from Swiss banks. Tax investigators in Germany have recently received information about a number of tax evaders who have hidden their assets away in Switzerland. The agreement gives these people an amnesty and the tax investigators can no longer use the information that has been made available to them. What sort of agreement is it that restricts the activities of tax investigators? An advertising video produced by Swiss banks says about this agreement that customers will benefit even more in future from the values of Switzerland as a financial centre. The agreement obviously not only lacks the necessary coordination at EU level, but also counteracts the efforts of the EU to bring more transparency into tax issues, to make the collection of tax in the Member States more efficient and, above all, to combat and to prevent tax fraud. Therefore, this agreement is, in our view, not acceptable. We are calling on the EU to oppose it, if there is any doubt. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Commissioner, for your answer which sounds very positive. However, I would like to emphasise once again that the problem lies in the fact that there was already a human rights clause in the old preferences scheme and it did not help to prevent the violations of human rights which took place under the Uribe government and before that. Therefore, my question was specifically: What exactly will be different? How do the EU and the Commission intend to guarantee in future that these violations of human rights will not be repeated? On the other hand, I have figures which show that under the new government in the last 300 days there have been more than 200 attacks on human rights activists. Also 15 leaders who supported human rights and the fair distribution of land in the agricultural sector have been murdered. When I look at what is happening, I have to ask once again: How exactly are you going to ensure that you can prevent this? I still do not know what the answer to this question is. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Goebbels has just set out very clearly the role that derivatives played in the financial crisis and what scale they possess. In view of this enormous scale, many citizens are calling for such financial products to be taken off the market altogether. We called for that too. However, we realise that such a small political group as ours has no chance of achieving a majority for this. We have to accept that, and we do. Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise once again that we thought it would be sensible to go further in this regard. On the other hand – and I say this to Mr Langen clearly and with respect – in our view the resulting report is acceptable and fair. Three important points from our perspective are the clearing obligation, the authorisation and monitoring of central counterparties and the reporting requirement for derivatives traders. These seem to us to provide an important and capable basic framework and a sound infrastructure that will enable us to arrive at a rational regulation. Moreover, this regulation is essential if we are to be able to levy a financial transaction tax – which is currently a subject of debate – on derivatives transactions. Although we have not succeeded in asserting all our demands, we believe that this report is absolutely worthy of our support. I would like to mention one more point that I considered to be particularly important: the reference to the problem of trading in food commodities and the associated speculation. We were only able to include this reference in the recitals; Mr Langen was prepared to do this. This point will come up again as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) progresses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 – (DE)
 Mr President, our party has already given this matter some consideration, but I do not have enough time to go into things to any degree right now. We do have some ideas for different ways of working with the financial markets, and how the things that derivatives are used for can, to some extent, be achieved by other means. It would take too long to explain all this at this juncture. However, I should be happy to provide you with more information in this connection. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session. Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple. The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated. As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these. The necessary translations were not available, either. We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009. However, the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table. For us, economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries. For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market. Naturally, for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets. None of this is to be found in the economic governance package. Instead, the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe. As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole. This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece, of Portugal and of Spain, but also those of northern European countries, back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe. The much-needed improvements on the Commission’s original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there – particularly in Mrs Ferreira’s report – have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council. In our view, the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable. As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with. This is reserved for the Commission. It bears little resemblance to democracy, and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future. In our view, the economic governance package – at least in its present form – is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing. That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not so much about individual people; it is, first and foremost, about a selection process. Surprisingly, anyone who searches for information on the selection process for the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Internet will essentially only discover that the United States and Europe share the two leading positions. That means that the economically strongest nations, as a minority, share control of the global economy among themselves, so to speak. That is feudalism and has nothing to do with democracy, and that is why we cannot accept this. In our view, Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepping down presents a major opportunity to make fundamental changes at this point to the nomination and selection process and to make it an open, transparent and, above all, merit- and qualification-based selection process, as some NGOs have been calling for recently. This should also include a combination of majority votes from the members of the IMF and a majority of voting shares in the IMF. Up to now, only the voting shares in the IMF have been taken into account, which ensures a structural majority for the economically strong nations. This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF. In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the core task of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is to promote the EU’s objectives through long-term financing of viable investments. This also means that the EIB is bound by the EU’s values; in other words, by social standards, transparency, high environmental standards, the development of a sustainable economy and the creation of jobs. However, we are hearing from NGOs involved in the local implementation of EIB-financed projects that it is by no means consistently ensured that these standards are met. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. The NGOs criticise the lack of transparency as regards the way in which loans are monitored across the EU and worldwide, how they are used and how they are reported on by the EIB’s financial intermediaries. To what extent is the EIB aware of these criticisms, and to what extent is the EIB actually looking into such criticisms? That is what we would like to know. From our point of view, at least some of what NGOs are calling for from the EIB is quite plausible: greater transparency as regards the granting of credit by financial intermediaries and the elaboration of clearer financing terms for financial intermediaries as well as efficiency criteria for the granting of loans. To improve transparency, NGOs further propose that environmental and financial information on EIB-financed projects be published before these are approved. In particular, EIB projects in third countries should be subjected to independent sustainability assessments in order to determine the economic, social and ecological impact of the project in question. However, there also appear to be other problems apart from transparency. Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental, social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs. Strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB’s financial operations. Projects that do not meet these standards should be excluded from support. Finally, I would like to make a comment on the subject of energy policy. It is pleasing that the promotion of a sustainable and safe energy supply is already one of the EIB’s current objectives. In view of the disaster involving the Fukushima reactor, the promotion of forward-looking, renewable, CO2
-free and nuclear-free energy production, as well as the promotion of energy efficiency in all areas in which the EIB invests, must be given the highest priority. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I think it is difficult to go into detail on this right now in view of the time available. However, I have a large number of reports from NGOs that I am happy to make available. I believe that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also familiar with these. These reports talk of how development aid is supported locally by the EIB in African and Asian countries and also make some criticisms of this. I am happy to make the reports available, but I cannot answer the question in detail right now. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I just wanted to provide a brief explanation. We have withdrawn Amendment 25, which related to the financial transaction tax. We have agreed with the other groups that we are able, and indeed intend, to negotiate in a more intensive and meaningful way within the Policy Changes Committee. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the call for a financial transaction tax is nothing new; opponents of globalisation have been calling for such a tax for some years. Just five years ago, however, hardly anyone would have thought that it might be possible to implement it in the foreseeable future. Yet this week, it is on the agenda of the European Parliament alongside a CO2
 tax and Eurobonds, and rightly so in my opinion. I can only welcome and support the financial instruments proposed by Mrs Podimata in her report, and I believe they will be voted through. These instruments are urgently needed. So far, the consolidation of national budgets has concentrated solely on cuts in expenditure. However, cuts in public spending primarily impact workers, pensioners and the poor; in other words, those reliant on the welfare state. The income side of public financing has been completely disregarded to date. It is the second lever that we can use to consolidate national budgets. In particular, addressing the income side would result in the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis shouldering an appropriate part of the public debt. If we are to consolidate national budgets, then it is quite simply imperative that we increase tax revenues. In fact, the high level of public debt is mainly a result of the nationalisation of private debt; in other words, of governments taking on the debts of private banks and financing the consequences of the financial crisis. The states are thus in no way solely responsible for the debt crisis. Asking the financial sector to dip into its own pockets is therefore not simply obvious; it is our political duty. A financial transaction tax would at last mean this sector shouldering part of this debt as one of the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis. This report would send out an important political signal were it to be adopted as presented. Similarly, we consider Eurobonds to be a sensible and, thus, also a necessary instrument. They will do more to reduce debt than all the sanctions and advice put together, however well meant. The complaints by some countries in surplus that Eurobonds would increase their interest burden are unacceptable since, at the same time, these countries in surplus are earning more from their exports to deficit countries. Some might criticise this as a transfer union. However, anyone who wants a social Europe – who wants the EU to continue to hold together in the future – must accept the idea of a transfer union at least in principle. Finally, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope that it will now finally present proposals for a financial transaction tax; we have been calling for this for over a year now.

 Support for small and medium-sized enterprises will safeguard numerous jobs and strengthen the innovation potential of the European economy. It is therefore absolutely right to ensure the reasonable provision of loan capital for these enterprises, as only then can they make the necessary investments. However, the increase in venture capital called for by the European Parliament is to be rejected on principle. Instead of placing banks under an obligation to support the real economy by providing appropriate credit, Parliament is calling for it to be easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to get contributions from investment funds and private equity firms on the capital markets. With a motto of ‘locusts for everyone’, the motion for a resolution calls in places for private equity firms to make it easier to do business with them. This would turn smaller enterprises in particular into the pawns of investors to an even greater extent than they are now. These investors are very often on the look-out for absurdly high two-figure profits, which they can usually only achieve by carving up the acquired enterprises and selling them off bit by bit.

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do. There is therefore an urgent need for action. I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA. That is an important and positive step in the right direction. However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report. I would like to mention this once again. Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change. The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency. The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about. Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products. This, too, has come to nothing. I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation. I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience. Many people thought – and I would like to underline this fact again here – that the crisis in the euro area was over. Ireland shows that this is not the case. Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets. The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages. At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us. This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland – the star pupil – that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system – a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation. In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama. It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach. While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty. Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB. Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel’s simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet. If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air. Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I admit that that is difficult to assess. I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now. Undoubtedly, it is a tricky situation, but I think that things have now developed so far that a rethink might possibly take place. I am sorry, but I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that question. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would like to make two comments. The first is addressed to Mr Gauzès. I would like to thank him specifically for his excellent work and cooperation. However, I also found the cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs to be exceptionally good and constructive. I wanted to say that right at the start before I come to my points of criticism. I can, in principle, accept and reinforce what Mr Giegold has just said. I could have supported the first compromise that we agreed on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in May of this year. Indeed, I was able to go along with the decision. However, what has now been produced as a result of further negotiations is, also in the opinion of my group, no longer acceptable and we can no longer support it. As I see it, everyone is entitled to his own opinion on the matter, but in my view, the Council has played an unfortunate role here. I will express this a bit clearer than one or two others have done. In my view, the Council has missed an opportunity here. It gave in to a considerable extent to the financial market lobby and used everything in its power to prevent an effective regulation at European level. One morning, I received a call from a lobbyist, who said that if we really wanted to regulate private equities in this way, we would prevent development aid getting to Africa. A more absurd and obscure argument could not be found in this regard. These things have nothing to do with one another. Anyone who comes up with this sort of argument merely demonstrates the fact that he has no interest in meaningful and effective regulation. However, this is not the concern of Parliament. On behalf of Parliament – and I would like to emphasise this once again – Mr Gauzès and other fellow Members fought for an effective regulation. That was undermined by the Council. I want to say this once again; this is passive marketing. This is a point that Mr Giegold has already mentioned. It is like someone being prohibited from selling rotten eggs at the weekly market if he advertises them, but if he does not advertise the rotten eggs and just stands there and sells them, then it is evidently legitimate. However, it is no different to what has been laid down here in the section relating to passive marketing. It provides an opening. We have a European regulation – that has already been said and I think it is a good thing. However, when the door is wide open for it to be circumvented through loopholes, then the question arises as to how effective this European regulation really is. Private equities were originally regulated better. They are now relatively weakly regulated. A very important point – and here, too, I can only reinforce what Mr Giegold said – is the question of the information provided to the workforce. The original compromise stated that managers were obliged to inform their workforce of what they intended to do with the companies in which they had invested. What remains of this is the strained requirement for owners to inform their workforce and the works councils. You can imagine what will come of this – not very much. The Council has missed an opportunity here, and I hope that we will perhaps still be able to improve on it at a later date. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, economic governance as it is being developed here focuses solely on savings and competition policy. As has just been mentioned by the honourable Member from Spain, the problem of Germany’s orientation towards exports has not been addressed at all. Yet this is clearly a central problem, both in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole. German competition policy is being conducted to the detriment of internal demand in Germany. This is not being discussed at all. Above all, however, it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages. It is a wage battle – a wage competition. This wage competition is exerting enormous pressure on our neighbouring European countries, on European trade unions and on European workers. Neither the Commission nor the Feio report have addressed this problem. Any economic governance worthy of the name must take corrective action in this area rather than remaining silent. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank my fellow Members who have participated in rather tough and lengthy negotiations here. It is a tremendous achievement by the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs to have managed to do what they have done. They achieved the best result that it was possible to negotiate. Nevertheless, I do not want to hold back on the criticism that my group has, either. There are three points in particular that we are not happy about. On the one hand, the competences that have been granted to the supervisory authorities are, in our view, inadequate. We would have liked these competences to have been more extensive. We believe it is also wrong for the supervisory authorities to be split over several locations. We advocated combining them as far as possible in one location. That would certainly have made cooperation easier and more efficient. Mr Giegold has already mentioned that the staffing could, and should in fact, be improved in the long term. These are our main points of criticism. Nevertheless, we believe this to be a right and important step in the right direction, a right and important step towards a new regulation of the financial markets that is urgently needed. However – and this is simply our assessment – we still need to take some further steps in order to arrive at a truly effective new regulation of the financial markets, to get to a point where, through European regulations, we can prevent another crisis like the one we have just experienced. Our group will contribute greatly to this. There are, of course, a few more legislative initiatives on the way. We hope that these will bring more substance to this matter. If so, something truly effective and good could come of this. However, we really do still have a few more steps to take in this regard. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would just like to remind you that the rating agency Moody downgraded Greece again last night. We all know that the Greek Government has placed enormous pressure on its people in recent weeks, in order to get the crisis under control. We all know that the European Union has put together a package worth EUR 750 billion in order to support the countries that have found themselves in crisis and to help them out of it. Nevertheless, Greece has been downgraded. In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package. Mr Barnier, you have just used the metaphor of a thermometer and said that it must not be broken. I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies. A thermometer obviously does nothing to help improve the condition of the clients, the patient in question – which is something it just cannot do. After all, the thermometer is no drug and is obviously making the patient’s condition even worse. However, it is unacceptable that the countries which are making these efforts should end up being downgraded even further, despite everything they have done. This raises the question about what these rating agencies actually do. It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming. Therefore, rating agencies did not help predict or diagnose the crisis. Shortly before it collapsed, Lehman Brothers received quite a positive rating. So, with the methods they used, they were not able or did not want to recognise what we had in store. In that respect, this instrument has been a total failure. Nor have they helped us manage the crisis. I have just given you a newspaper quote on that: ‘Ratings have not helped improve the crisis situation despite all the efforts made and there is concern’ – as the media put it – ‘that we will not be able to see through the packages we have put together’. This means they will pull us down and downgrade us even further. To conclude, I would like to point out that countries and companies are just not comparable. We have to take a closer look at these ratings. Just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough. What we need is a root-and-branch reform of rating systems. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of this opportunity to take another look at the situation in Greece, because I believe that the crisis in Greece gives us an insight into the political status of the euro area. Firstly, however, I would like to make a remark about the calls from the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, to exclude Greece from the euro area, if necessary. My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, believes that this proposal is absolutely absurd. On the one hand, we are talking about a community with a common destiny. If we mean this seriously, then we cannot call, on the other hand, for a Member State to be excluded during the first large or moderate crisis that we have encountered. That is preposterous! Most importantly, this would be an admission of failure which would amount to kowtowing to the financial sector. The financial sector has shamelessly allowed itself to be bought out of the crisis by taxpayers, but we are now being asked to deny help of this kind to Greece. It will be difficult to explain to the pensioners and the workers in Greece and also in the other countries affected – according to the media, Portugal is the next country to come under scrutiny – why they are now being asked to pay up, having already supported the banks with their taxes. Taking this route would be the equivalent of driving the EU project into a wall. Despite all the justified criticism of Greece – and the Greek Members will realise that there is much to be done in their country – the crisis is by no means solely the responsibility of Greece. I would just like to point out that the majority of decisions on financial policy in the euro area have been handed over to the European Central Bank. The euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies. Major exporters such as Germany are forcing Greek economic policy to its knees. Therefore, this also represents a crisis in EU economic and competition policy. This is why we are calling for the ban on financial assistance for EU Member States to be lifted. The Member States in the euro area should make euro loans available, the European Central Bank should buy up debts in the same way that the Federal Service in the USA has done and credit default swaps should be banned. This is what we are calling for. (The President cut off the speaker) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to comment on two aspects of the Turkish issue. It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed, and rightly so. There is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain. However, what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in Turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights. The Turkish Government continues to oppose trade unions – in some circumstances even using the power of the police – which provide support for their members, in other words, for Turkish working people. This has happened recently in the dispute involving the Tekel workers. That is one of the comments that I would like to make. A democratic society must protect the rights of employees and trade unions and it is important to fight for these rights. The EU also supports these rights, in particular, in its role as a social European Union. The second factor is privatisation. Turkey is adapting to the EU and this includes the area of privatisation. The Tekel employees, of whom 12 000 are currently on strike, are threatened with the loss of their jobs or have already lost them as a result of privatisation. However, it is not only the Tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry. Around 500 000 people employed in growing tobacco in south-eastern Turkey have lost their jobs in recent years, with the result that, having been one of the major producers and exporters of tobacco, Turkey has now become an importer. A week ago, I had the chance to go to Ankara and speak with the Tekel employees. If the process of cutting jobs and destroying whole sectors of industry continues as a result of privatisation, the people of Turkey will lose their enthusiasm for accession to the EU. Therefore, we must put the focus on the social aspect of the EU. I would like to emphasise that once again. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years. Since the ban – we have only just heard about this – more than a thousand people have been arrested. I think that, in a country in which parties are routinely banned, it is no longer possible to talk of democracy. The prohibition of 27 Kurdish parties almost constitutes an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of Records. It is not only about the minorities in Turkey – and this is something that I would also like to mention again at this point. There is currently a strike being held by tobacco workers at the firm Tekel that is very intense and is now escalating. Several thousand workers went on hunger strike today in order to enforce their rights. They feel they have been severely oppressed by the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities. This aspect must be taken into account, because the protection of the rights of workers and trade unions is an integral part of democracy. The trade unions, but also the minorities, in Turkey are awaiting a clear and unambiguous opinion from this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the previous speakers. I would like to remind everyone that the Colombian President also attempted to extend his term of office in breach of current Colombian law and, therefore, this matter should also be taken up. Most importantly, however, I would like to highlight the fact that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation in Germany, a foundation which has close links with the German Free Democratic Party, was involved in the coup in Honduras. There was a debate about this at least in Germany. The foundation’s scholarship holders distanced themselves from this policy in an open letter. We must not forget that Mr van Baalen is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Friedrich-Naumann foundation, it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua. I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances – and this has not been contradicted – a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind. In all honesty, we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe. What is happening here is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discredit and publicly shame those countries, states and governments in Latin America which are trying to introduce more social policies. On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to say clearly once again that we will not support this. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament’s agenda many times. It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. That has been said a couple of times already. Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament. In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU. On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request. It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail. As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests. Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered? If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered? My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests? Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the world economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves cannot yet be foreseen. We have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force. What does the European Union do in this situation, where more and more people are threatened by poverty and unemployment and fear for their existence? The European Union decides on new focal areas in its budget. Or, to be more precise, it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders, in favour of hi-tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe’s citizens. Believe it or not, there is to be an increase of 16% for the area of freedom, security and justice. The fund to secure the external borders is to receive 12% more funding next year. The expenditure on strategic military security research is being almost doubled and will now rise to a total of EUR 215 million. From the point of view of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, this means that the EU is taking leave of its founding idea of being a peace project for Europe. This draft budget instead follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, with its obligation on the part of the Member States to constantly modernise their military apparatus and to secure the external borders. Europe’s Left instead demands that the European Union implement a consistent peace policy. Instead of an agency for armament, we call for a disarmament agency. Europe must concentrate its resources on civilian conflict resolution strategies such as a Europe-wide civilian peace corps and promoting independent research into peace and conflicts. In our view, this budget sets our sights increasingly on war instead of on crisis management and the Left in the European Parliament will not, therefore, support this budget. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council spring summit is traditionally devoted to discussing the economic and employment policies of the European Union, more recently in connection with the so-called European Semester. This year, however, the debate is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic situation in Greece. Greece is the ideal example on which to base a discussion about the failure of the economic and financial policies of the European Union. The predominant global policy of deregulation and privatisation has plunged the European Union into the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. As a result of this policy of deregulation, the global financial markets and also the commodity markets have got completely out of control or, more accurately, have fallen victim to speculators. The Greek crisis is also a result of EU policy, because the existing macro-economic imbalances between the Member States will be significantly exacerbated by the Europe 2020 strategy. These imbalances are what the financial speculators are now gambling on. It is not only Greece which is fighting for survival. A policy which has had such disastrous consequences in Greece and in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, needs fundamental changes. In fact, it must be reversed. Austerity measures are making the economic recession worse, as the fall in the gross domestic product figures of these countries has shown so dramatically. My group was strongly opposed to the Europe 2020 strategy and the imposition of one-sided austerity and debt reduction policies right from the outset. Instead, we need programmes to stimulate sustainable growth and to create jobs, together with programmes for investment, for the environment and for education. A policy which involves axing social services, abolishing social legislation and restricting fundamental democratic and parliamentary rights, while at the same time supporting the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, can only lead to outrage and social unrest. The Greek Government is losing its political base, the parties which belong to it are losing their members and the structure of society is collapsing. This is the result of Greek and European policy and it requires a fundamental change in the EU’s approach in favour of one which serves the interests of the people rather than those of the banks. One scenario could begin with the financial markets. Let us imagine that the European Central Bank (ECB) could lend money directly to the Member States via a public bank. This would enable the Member States to circumvent the international financial markets and to obtain the loans they need at favourable interest rates. No one could gamble on Greek, Portuguese or other bonds. All of the hype surrounding the markets would disappear. Does that sound appealing? All we need is the determination to take this step, and this is what my group is calling for. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the financial markets has led to developments on the markets that have not yet been brought under control. Only radical measures to prevent speculation on the markets will be able to put a definitive stop to the crisis. Instead of this, with the adoption of the Fiscal Compact Treaty we are seeing a further increase in the one-sided focus on austerity policy and the destruction of social cohesion. My group is strongly opposed to this radical approach of debt reduction and cuts in public budgets. It has even been criticised by the International Monetary Fund. The financial guru George Soros says that this austerity policy has thrown Europe into a deflationary spiral of debt. The debt brake was laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht and its adoption in national law is now intended to force its implementation. If that does not happen, the Member States are to be penalised with the help of the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union. That is absurd, and it is also undemocratic, as the Member States will lose their most important right: their budgetary sovereignty. Furthermore, it is totally unacceptable for the aid that is used to show solidarity with Member States which are in difficulty to be made conditional on signing up to the Fiscal Compact Treaty. This sacrifices the most important fundamental principle of the European Union on the altar of the financial markets. The Left will work to bring about a reversal of this disastrous policy. We need a pact for sustainable growth and employment. We need public programmes for investment in the environment and education and, above all, we need the European Parliament and the citizens to have a say. The Treaty must be approved by referendum or by public consultation. (Applause) Lothar Bisky  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, on October 30, our colleague Mr Meyer, a member of my group, was forcibly prevented from leaving the airport in the city of El-Aaiún in Western Sahara, receiving injuries from Moroccan security forces. The doctor diagnosed various contusions, problems with the neck muscles and dangerously high blood pressure as a consequence of the violence. This attack on a Member of the European Parliament is completely unacceptable. The President, the offices of the European Parliament and the national authorities have made representations to the Moroccan Government. So far there has been no response from Morocco. We cannot simply accept this without a word. I would ask for your solidarity. This outrageous incident is an opportunity for me to remind us all, yet again, that the people of Western Sahara have been suffering for decades as a result of the inability of politicians to bring about a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict. I believe that we can no longer remain silent. We should focus more on this issue in the second half of this electoral term. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the EU summit was supposed to bring about a breakthrough in the process of resolving the international financial crisis. It has undoubtedly not succeeded in doing so, because too many issues have been ignored and there has been a one-sided focus on reducing public debt and budgetary supervision. Even much of this was very unspecific. It may have given us a breathing space, but nothing more. The much-talked-about confidence of the markets cannot be regained by imposing an austerity policy based on the German model. The causes of the financial crisis are varied in nature, but the failure of independent bodies and, most importantly, the political system to manage or monitor the unregulated financial markets is the decisive factor. If we apply this standard, it is clear that the leading politicians of the 27 EU Member States once again did not want or were unable to take action. Increasing the financial power of the instruments which are intended to prevent speculation by bringing forward by one year the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) that amounts to EUR 500 billion, by continuing in parallel with the European Financial Stability Facility, and by extending the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with EUR 200 billion, will only guarantee that the banks will have their loans repaid and make a healthy profit on the interest. This is how the governments of the euro countries want to play the game with the financial markets, but they forget that they are in the weaker position. Most importantly, the failed attempt to leverage the rescue funds demonstrates the power and the powerlessness of the policy. The main opponent within the EU of regulating the international financial markets has gone into self-imposed isolation. Hopefully, decisive action will now be taken to tackle this problem, at least within the euro area and the EU Member States which want to join the euro. The first step must be to implement the international transaction tax quickly. Next, the most dangerous new financial products must simply be banned. This also applies to the activities of the shadow banks. The European Union can and must make progress and set an example in this area. If EU banks try to evade regulation in other parts of the world, they will be threatened with the removal of state rescue packages in the case of a crisis. Their business can ultimately be placed under state supervision or they can be nationalised. This would be an appropriate response to a systemic crisis. The consequences of the international crisis, which has been going on since 2008, are already unbearable for the vast majority of citizens. Young people’s plans for the future, provisions for the working population and the life’s work of millions of people have already been destroyed, with the most serious impact being felt, of course, in the crisis countries of Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. However, the citizens of all EU countries are affected by the excessive austerity measures. They are the culmination of the neoliberal policy of deregulation and privatisation and the redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top. This policy over the last 15 years is what has taken us into the crisis and, therefore, it must be stopped and reversed. We can only ensure that public interests are served and that the welfare state is maintained by restraining blind market forces. Austerity measures will not stimulate growth and will not lead us out of the crisis. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, the crisis merry-go-round is turning faster and faster and more and more euro countries are being pulled aboard. Even the countries with the best triple A ratings, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, are feeling the adverse effects caused by the financial markets, which are playing cat and mouse with the euro countries. All the measures that we have adopted so far to regulate them have had hardly any effect. We can therefore legitimately ask whether it is time to change the rules of the game. However, the decision on this needs to be made by the EU institutions and not by means of intergovernmental agreements, such as those envisaged by Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy. The vicious circle of downgrades to countries’ ratings and rising interest rates has to be stopped. Therefore, we are making a decisive call for the evaluation of sovereign states by private rating agencies to be qualified and for the creation of an independent European agency. In addition, the European Central Bank must be allowed to buy bonds without restrictions. Ms Merkel seems to be ready to exchange her resistance to this for closer supervision of the budgets of individual countries and automatic sanctions. However, this involves allowing intervention in the sovereignty rights of individual states, in this case budgetary rights, which means that the inherent rights of national parliaments will be disregarded. In future, the Commission aims to be able to force countries to make social security cuts, lengthen working hours and increase the retirement age. I can only warn against implementing this policy. The results in Germany show that it puts a very one-sided burden on the majority of the population. Consequently, the social divide will become even wider. The low-wage sector now covers 20% of all working people. More and more people are finding themselves living in poverty in their old age. By contrast, a few rich people are becoming even wealthier. As a result of this policy, social equality is no longer functioning and society is threatened with collapse. I am opposed to a future of this kind for the European Union. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, as the example of Italy shows, where risk premiums for government bonds exceeded the critical mark of 7% for a while, the markets are relatively unimpressed by the decisions of the most recent European summit. The next euro area country is already in their sights. The increase in rates in Italy since October is not based on any trends in the real economy, and as the experiences of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain in similar situations show, concentrated remedial measures from the EU and the IMF and the use of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) appear inescapable. That clearly shows that the measures we have adopted so far to regulate the financial markets do not fully take effect. I fear that, even with the new plans to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area, this will not significantly change. When I think of the package of European Commission measures that you have announced, President Barroso, with the five proposals for increased economic policy coordination, I cannot see the answer to the main question, namely do you have the courage and the ability to regulate the players on the international financial markets in such a way that, in future, speculative activity could be excluded as far as possible? Ecofin’s discussions on the financial transaction tax demonstrate that there is no political will in the Member States even for small steps. The finance ministers continue to answer global challenges with national thinking and proposed solutions based on the interests of their national banks. How big does this crisis have to get, how many countries need to be mired in it, and how big must the sacrifices of the populaces of the countries affected be before people see that we need to act? You propose, for example, issuing a Green Paper on Euro Stability Bonds. Much as I stress the necessity to introduce Eurobonds, I am astounded by the method. How long do you want to spend talking about the necessary minutiae of the shape to be taken by the mechanism? What effect will the time spent on the discussion process have on the markets? For me, these are the crucial questions. Instead, the monitoring of the budgets of individual countries is to be tightened up again. It is as if you believed that forcing austerity measures would trigger growth. In reality, however, the most pressing issue is the need for specific measures to improve growth and employment, with the resultant income and thus domestic demand. The austerity measures put in place in the crisis only serve to deepen it. The key economic figures for Greece, Portugal and Ireland for 2010 and 2011 surely show this. There is one question that, it seems to me, has not been given sufficient consideration, namely how can additional sources of finance be unlocked for these Member States? Their Government revenues need to be increased. Up to now, we have only heard proposals to cut social security payments, wages and pensions, or to increase VAT. The result of this is to stifle consumption by the mass of the population, and the fairness gap between the rich and the poor could become even larger. The citizens, too, can feel this. They do not see themselves as responsible for this crisis, and they are right. They are calling for social equality, including fair taxation. That is why there are mass protests in the Member States where austerity packages have been imposed. That is why there is political instability in the crisis countries, where numerous governments have already been swept aside. If the austerity course were to be made worse, the protests would also grow further. Where does that lead us? It strikes me that there is a complete lack of taxing the banks, the big corporations and the rich in the Member States. They could make a greater contribution to overcoming the crisis without difficulty. Tangible steps in this direction are required. That would give the citizens the feeling that the pain was being shared more fairly. However, that policy direction must also come from you, from the Commission, the Council, the Euro Group and other international institutions. It has been shown, after all, that the neoliberal mantra of tax cuts and reducing the regulation of market forces led to such terrible distortions that the entire global financial system is in jeopardy. A reorientation of thinking and approach is required here. We need a ban on short-term trading of credit default swaps, on short selling and of other high risk financial products. That is the order of the day. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were promised a bold move that would constitute a comprehensive solution to overcome the debt crisis. But what has the summit actually achieved? The Greek debt crisis has entered a new phase with the agreed haircut of 50%. This is something to be welcomed because it means that the country is freed from a significant part of its national debt. This is a positive outward signal and eases the situation for the Greek Government. This step does not mean a reversal in the downward spiral of the Greek economy, however. According to expert assessments, the country’s financial needs up to 2020 have already risen to EUR 250 billion. Likewise, this has not reduced the disastrous consequences for the people of Greece. In particular, the Greek banks need to survive the consequences of the haircut. They need extensive supports if they are to be rescued from ruin, otherwise it is not just the bond holders who will bear the cost, but also countless Greek citizens with their savings, pensions and other insurance cover. Much as I welcome the fact that the main culprits for the debt crisis are being called to greater account, this may be a risky move, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and for many ordinary savers. What assets will be levied by the banks? I believe that a socially just solution can more probably be achieved with nationalised banks, although a rescue or capitalisation of the banks should be made conditional on direct consultation or even more effective controls by the state. Banks in these countries should be recapitalised to the same extent as banks in France, Germany and other countries. The question remains whether the haircut will bring the much-vaunted lasting solution for Greece and the other endangered countries. Will this restore the trust of citizens and investors in the international financial markets? This is a question that I can only answer by quoting a famous phrase from Faust: ‘While I have heard the message– about the summit – I am not sure I believe it.’ When I think of the general strike and the further mobilisation of the public, I know that the Greek people have lost confidence massively. What is more, democracy itself is in huge danger, after all a government can only act against the opinion of the majority of the population for so long. This is a question that must also be answered by the IMF, ECB and the Council, in other words the so-called Troika, which has placed Greece under this austerity regime. My doubts also relate to the financial trick of leveraging the rescue fund. Although this will mobilise more financial resources, the question is at what cost? Countries are playing according to the rules of the financial markets and believe themselves to be in a strong position. If you will permit me, this is an illusion. The state debt crisis may not just spread very rapidly, but may also require massively increased commitments. This increases the risk to the taxpayer several fold. We must act decisively in bringing the power of the international financial community to heel, otherwise the crisis will spread. Everything is to play for. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of the crisis is becoming less and less transparent and more and more chaotic. The Council is starting to introduce pre-summits and main summits within the space of three days. Parliament is following the same rhythm and debating the results of the Council discussions twice during one part-session. It is already becoming clear that the big step forward that has been promised will not be happening on this occasion either. The only thing left to say is that the Council and the Commission are continuing to work on the principle of hope: hope that the new measures will generate sufficient confidence and that the investors on the international financial markets will be satisfied this time around. Why should they stop betting on future state bankruptcies? Why should they not try to draw Spain and Italy into the maelstrom of speculation? Only radical measures to prevent profitable speculation can stop this from happening. Until we bring in measures of this kind, the carousel will continue to turn and the Council will continue to propose rescue packages based on taxpayers’ money. The suggestion now is to use financial engineering tricks to leverage the agreed funding of EUR 87 billion for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). One German economist has referred in this context to a weapon of mass destruction, because the states which are showing signs of weakness require financing to the tune of EUR 4 trillion. The proposed haircut for Greece is inevitable. The only question is: who will bear the cost of it? Of course, it is right that the international banks should take on a greater share of up to 60%. However, it is important for us to prevent bankruptcies. This affects Greek banks in particular, whose very existence is under threat. After all the cuts in social security spending, do the Greek citizens now have to worry about the safety of their savings and bank deposits? Instead of a rescue package for the banks, we need a rescue package for wages, salaries, pensions and citizens’ savings. We need a public bank in the European Union which provides states with the necessary loans at favourable interest rates and excludes the private banks. We need public investment programmes to create jobs and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, since the last debates on the state of the European Union here in Parliament, the situation has come to a head. I would like to say that none of the proposals have been taken up and implemented. I recognise that the situation has become rather critical. That is perhaps our problem. We are a long way from a comprehensive solution. It seems as if the players on the financial markets are just telling themselves that they do not need to take all this very seriously and that they will just carry on regardless – and they are carrying on regardless. They are cheerfully betting on the interest rates for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds, while the credit rating agencies, which are caught in a conflict of interests, are fanning the flames by reducing the credit rating of Spain and Italy. Greater attention is now turning to those European banks, whose undercapitalisation poses a growing risk, as demonstrated by the Dexia bank, for example. The people of Greece, Portugal and Spain are organising mass protests against the drastic measures to reduce public expenditure. Unemployment, the situation among young people and the austerity measures are mostly burdening citizens rather than those who have caused the crisis, namely, the players on the unregulated financial markets. In our Member States, there is an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions of Europe. This week, marchers from Spain, the indignados
, are here in Brussels. They want to give expression to their protest against the consequences of the policy of privatisation and liberalisation, which has led to the excesses of the markets. This movement of dissatisfied people encompasses all of those countries that are placing the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people. The clear failure of neoliberal policy affects not only the financial markets; it is clear here that speculating on rising and falling prices has long since reached other areas, for example, the global agricultural market and the commodities markets. The functioning of the real economy itself is at risk, because only a few large international companies can cope in a financially sensible way with the extreme fluctuations. Although we talk about it frequently, we have ended up in a hare and tortoise situation in which the market participants, representing the tortoise, proudly proclaim ‘I am already here’. I believe that if we want to take ourselves seriously, we need to ensure that we also discuss the follow-up to the debates. I would say that, in my opinion, nothing of any consequence has changed. If the sensible proposals that have been put forward here, including by Mr Barroso, cannot be put into practice, then the situation really is desperate. That is the crucial point of criticism that I would like to express. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Union is undergoing its most serious crisis since it was first founded. This is something that we definitely all agree on. It is, of course, all about the economic, financial and debt crisis, about Greece and about the euro. The Member States and the European Union have not put in place sufficiently effective regulation of the financial markets. As a result, the policy is likely to end up at the mercy of the speculators. The measures which have been taken so far are aimed at budgetary consolidation by means of cutting spending. In concrete terms this primarily means reducing social security budgets. It means cuts in salaries and benefits, rising unemployment, falling public investment and a drop in real economic growth. More and more decisions are being taken on an intergovernmental basis without prior agreement with parliaments, but instead in agreement with bank bosses. As a result, the European Union is increasingly losing confidence and support. The eurosceptics are gaining ground and that is a fact. The European Union is in the midst of a crisis of political credibility. I believe that we are all of the same opinion in this respect. Mr Barroso, we do not entirely agree either on the analysis of the causes of the crisis or on the best ways of resolving it. Despite the need for criticism, I would like to emphasise that we on the left are aware of our responsibility for the European Union. The idea of European unity is a left-wing idea which has been defended by many left-wingers past and present. We will continue to defend this idea in the future and we will make sure that it is not surrendered to the profit interests of the markets and the speculators. I am convinced that Europe needs much more cooperation, rather than a further withdrawal into national interest. Europe needs a jointly coordinated, democratically legitimate, economic, fiscal and social policy based on solidarity. Therefore, we will support you, Mr Barroso, when you finally present the promised legislative proposals, which have been called for by Parliament, as the first steps towards comprehensive regulation of the financial markets, taxation of financial market transactions and Eurobonds in order to reaffirm the principle of solidarity in the European Union. We will continue to emphasise the value of solidarity between states and between people and the urgent need for it. Solidarity does not just involve financial aid. It also involves resisting the governments’ mania for austerity measures. As the main representative of a genuine European institution, you should be able to support our call for a step back from this culture of austerity. The fact that the social divide within society is growing much wider also seems ominous to me. The politicians are focusing on saving the banks and making available credit facilities of hundreds of billions of euros. However, the ordinary people are being left to pick up the tab for the failed policy of deregulation and privatisation. Huge austerity programmes are being imposed on them, they have to work longer hours and their wages and benefits are being cut. They are at the mercy of the governments’ austerity programmes. Social justice is simply being trampled underfoot and we cannot go on like this. The mass demonstrations in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are making this quite clear. Finally, I would like to say that either we will take a joint route out of the crisis based on solidarity, which will allow the EU to emerge from the crisis in a better, more social, more sustainable and even more democratic form, or there will be no solution for the EU as a whole, with damaging after-effects that are hard to predict.

 Mr President, it is true that this is a different problem. However, I would like to make it quite clear where I believe the risks lie. I think I have explained that. We will not solve any of the problems of the 21st century by withdrawing to the level of the nation states. (Applause)
 This is why I am also defending the Community method. That is what I wanted to explain. Otherwise we need, of course, to differentiate clearly between all these things. However, the basis must be that the countries of Europe can come to a solution together. That is why the European Union exists. As individual countries they will not achieve anything and will slide back into the Middle Ages. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, tomorrow, this House will vote on the tightening up and expansion of the Stability Pact. If the package of measures goes through as negotiated, then public borrowing will be penalised in practical terms. The Member States will have to introduce extreme cuts and savings. My group believes that this is the wrong approach, however that is not important right now. My question to you is: what do you think needs to be done to improve revenue for the Member States? Do we not need urgent measures to bring to an end the ruinous race to reduce taxes in Europe with minimum tax rates for business profits and high incomes? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
I have a supplementary question. We believe that the European Central Bank is taking the right and responsible course by holding down interest rates for endangered EU States by buying up government bonds. Should we not finally abolish this taboo and approve the purchase of government bonds – provided, above all, that such purchases are subject to clear and transparent rules? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of the so-called crisis summits have produced solutions to the debt crisis and to the uncontrolled speculation. State aid is still being given to the banks and austerity measures are hitting the poorest people and the middle class hardest, particularly in the debt crisis countries, but also in Germany. This weakens overall economic demand, investment and social cohesion within the European Union. Despite many announcements, we have not succeeded in putting in place comprehensive regulations governing the financial markets. The citizens of Europe and the markets themselves obviously have doubts about the economic competence and the ability to act of those in power and of the EU institutions. I must make it clear right from the beginning that none of this pleases me. I agree with those Members who proposed that the EU constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon, should be revised. Before the treaty came into force, my group had already pointed out that it does not meet the current social, democratic and economic requirements and challenges. Please allow me to make a brief remark about the EU budget for 2012 and the medium-term financial plan, which we will soon be discussing. The more cuts we make, the less funding will be available for cohesion and structural policy, for supporting cultural institutions and for exchange programmes in the fields of education and research. However, it is precisely these policies which represent the added value offered by the EU, which allow the citizens of Europe to experience the EU at first hand and which represent the first moves towards a social union. In my opinion, anyone who calls this into question is putting the idea of the European Union at risk. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, the Polish Presidency may be able to offer some ray of hope in a time of crisis when there is little enthusiasm for Europe. A clear majority of the Polish people are positively disposed towards the EU, far more so than in many other countries. I very much welcome the openness promised in the Presidency’s programme, which includes better relations with our neighbouring states of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. As Poland’s western neighbour, Germany has had some positive experiences in relation to cooperation between regions close to national borders. There is a wide range of political challenges that we are all facing. In relation to the decisions on economic governance, we need more open, respectful cooperation between the EU institutions, in particular, between the Council and Parliament. In terms of substance, I can only reiterate that we need to start rescuing people, not just the banks. Let me say something on the reform of the EU budget. I do not believe that the budget can realistically be frozen for the medium term. Populist slogans like ‘It is time for the EU to tighten its belt’ clearly miss the point. In this time of crisis, the EU can and must demonstrate its added value by acting as an effective community based on solidarity and that is how I interpreted your speech. I believe that there is room for improvement in the agenda in relation to energy and climate policy. A new global agreement on climate change to follow on from the Kyoto Protocol will have to be reached in the coming months. The European Union must not slow this process down. I wish the Polish Presidency every success. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something. Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece. However, everything is just continuing as before. Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded. At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States. The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model. Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things. However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets. The consequences can still be felt today. I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however. Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks. In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told. In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop. Things will just carry on as before. The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy. However, we lack the courage to do this. The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with. That is where the problem lies. We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors. This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground. I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be ‘let us carry on as before’. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years. I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs. Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process. Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges. As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe. Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer. I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts. At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system. In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand. This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed. Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation. I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr Barroso, I have just one brief question. I am pleased that the G8 summit and the e-G8 forum that preceded it discussed the Internet. There are also concerns about why those with power are concerning themselves with the Internet. We are aware of how sensitive this area is. Is there any more you can tell us in this connection? Is this a one-off, or will there be further discussion? Will you be putting this on the agenda again? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 My curiosity is still somewhat unsated on this issue and I would like to ask you if you would be prepared to tell us, in general terms, about these further negotiations concerning the Internet, as this is an important and far-reaching measure for the future. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism. To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours. The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this? With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy? It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests. However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past. The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests. The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms. The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya. Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there. What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur? How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity? My group is particularly concerned with this question. The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common. They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations. The EU must respond to this demand. In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, my Group finds the results of the Council meeting inadequate. Firstly, let us consider economic policy. We have articulated our thoughts on the agreed guidelines in the area of economic policy in a hearing held last week. What we need is to overcome the neo-liberal practice of profit and competition fixing, evident in terms such as ‘flexicurity’, adjustment of retirement age, and so on. We believe that there is a need for democratically legitimised, controlled economic policy management that will prevent tax, wage and environmental dumping practices through appropriate common minimum standards that will provide effective regulation for the financial markets and prohibit the privatisation of profits, while at the same time passing on the risks to the public at large. My second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and Libya in particular. The EU Member States have become involved in a macabre situation in North Africa, particularly in Libya. We have already heard some criticism here. I would just like to emphasise one point: the dictator Gaddafi is using weapons purchased from us against the demonstrators and rebels. He is under fire from NATO troops apparently in order to protect those fighting for freedom and democracy, who are also using European and US weaponry. I would like to know the point of the existing code of honour in relation to arms dealing if such a situation can exist? Where is the support for freedom, human rights and the fight against social injustice in specific cases such as Lampedusa, where hundreds of refugees are arriving from North Africa every day? I fear that the newly cobbled together neighbourhood concept is more about European interests than an appropriate response to the needs of the partner countries. My third point relates to Japan. We still have time to discuss Japan this afternoon and tomorrow. Here too we fail to recognise a coherent European approach, at least as far as safety controls, the so-called stress tests, are concerned. I am not surprised that our citizens are asking with justified scepticism what exactly the European Union’s position is on this issue. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
My question is similar to that of Mr Schulz. For this reason I intend to focus on a particular aspect. Naturally you will understand that, in the light of our experiences with the bank stress tests, we have become more sensitive about stress tests, including those relating to nuclear power. My question relates to Euratom. I do not wish to sit as judge and jury on the huge sums of money that Euratom swallows up on research. In my personal opinion, this research funding is being spent on a technology riddled with risk. I do not believe these risks are subject to adequate common controls, nor do I believe that there is sufficient scope for joint decision-making on this issue. After all, nuclear power does not respect national borders. That is precisely where the problem lies. Is it not the case that decisions on nuclear power should be taken on a joint basis because radiation recognises no boundaries? Lothar Bisky,

 Mr Barroso, what would you think of the idea of establishing a European institution for promoting renewable energies, for the environmentally sensitive provision of energy and for energy savings within the framework of the EU Treaty? Do you think this proposal would be worthy of your support as it could rid us of the risks of nuclear power more quickly? Lothar Bisky,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union without effective coordination of economic policy will not work. The Stability and Growth Pact has failed – on this many experts across party-political boundaries are agreed. The problem is that politics does not seem to have made much progress. In fact, no new political concepts are in sight. Let me remind you that the stability pact’s 3% limit has been breached 73 times since 1999, 46 times in a way that is barely tolerable under the Treaty – yet in not one single case has a penalty been imposed. This non-functioning pact does not need to be revised; it simply needs to be implemented more – or rather, it needs to be implemented in the first place. Naturally, every householder and every entrepreneur knows how important it is to have sustainable budgets. However, I fear that in the forthcoming decisions on economic governance and on the European Stability Mechanism it will be all about cuts. That is not the same as a sustainable budget. No state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates. However much it saves, its debt will continue to rise – all the more so if wages, unemployment benefit and pensions have to be reduced, working hours extended, and public investment in infrastructure, education, health and so on cut back. If there is no consumption, then production will also collapse. Neither tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact nor the so-called strict conditionality of the future stability mechanism will therefore lead us to our goal. What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis-hit countries in particular, and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates. The mention of the necessity of reducing macro-economic imbalances will be problematic for so long as it is only demanded of economically weak states, while those that are economically strong are allowed to continue as before. Not only does the key word ‘solidarity’ not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other.

 Mr President, I find it remarkable that unease now reigns in the majority of the groups in this House in respect of approving the use of a fast-track procedure for the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This report clearly confirms our expectation as MEPs that any future crisis-management mechanism will not create parallel structures outside the Union and that parliamentary democratic supervision should be maintained at every stage. It is just that I find myself somewhat lacking in belief in this regard. Mr Barroso did make clear yesterday that he supports both the goal of social cohesion within the Union and the Community method. All the speakers agreed with him. Thus far, however, this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that, it strikes me, is something lacking. What there was – or not – was the Merkel-Sarkozy pact. That awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism. For my group, it is clear that we cannot give our approval to any policy that aims to consolidate the budget by means of further cuts in the social sphere. The European Parliament must first be given a vote on the specific proposals for the Union’s future economic and monetary policy and the related mechanisms, as these are what this is about at its core. That, in turn, is such a fundamental decision that it must not be taken on the basis of ‘Europe by decree’ but only in accordance with the convention method laid down by the Treaty. My group is thus unable to vote in favour of what is, in many respects, a positive report. Ultimately, despite constant assertions to the contrary, this would, of course, set a precedent. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, I was pleased to note that you have appreciated the social dimension of this issue and have supported a social settlement. This will certainly be necessary. There is no need to repeat much of what my fellow Members have said as I am in complete agreement with them. I am extremely sceptical of the pact that has been presented by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. Why is this? Because their reasons for presenting it are not very clear. The fact that it has no validity is quite a different issue. They are both clever strategists. I cannot accept their claim that things simply happened this way. I believe that they mean things precisely as stated there. This is the point I would like to return to once again. I believe that this is a very serious issue. Although they believe that this clause on the indexation of wages and salaries is the right answer, I am not so sure. In black and white terms, increasing the pensionable age can also be described as a reduction in pensions. It will be extremely hard to reduce debt. After all, even countries like Germany find this very difficult. I can imagine that Ireland or Greece will find themselves in huge difficulty here. I am a little sceptical about what the proposed solution is supposed to achieve. I expect transparency in this matter. You will receive support from Parliament if you play your part in promoting greater transparency and ensuring that games like this are not played out behind Parliament’s back. If these people want to make social security cuts, they need say so clearly, rather than taking countless detours to reach an objective that you, Mr Barroso, do not share and that we certainly do not share. We are prepared to discuss the concept of coordinated European economic governance with you provided that this economic governance is worthy of the name, in other words, that it is democratic in structure and that it will help establish a sustainable, socially responsible European community. We are also willing to discuss amendments to the Treaty, for example, in relation to a social progress clause. However, we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation. This is the only way that Parliament can monitor this process. It cannot be done without information! Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mrs Harms mentioned something important yesterday. Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations. One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis. Quite the contrary – it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place. It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact. This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms. In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens. It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts. Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible – all of this means wage restraint and cuts. It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society. In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt. It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey. This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support. However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy. Yesterday’s debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point. We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century. Nobody wants that. Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has only been in existence for a short time. However, it is now going to be modified for the second time in just a few months because of what is alleged to be an urgent matter. As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure. We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament. Now the Council is once again under time pressure and many Heads of Government want the new Treaty modification to be implemented using the supposedly tried and tested fast-track procedure. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left opposes this approach, which is threatening to become a standard process, and is calling for Treaty modifications to be managed using the normal procedure, including the convention, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.

Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make some brief remarks about the media law. Many speakers have mentioned this, but I will not repeat what they have said. I would just like to make one point. This is not interference in Hungarian affairs. I believe, and I have only learnt this late in life, that the media are responsible for monitoring those in power and the economy. This situation must remain unchanged. Therefore, the media must not be monitored themselves by other higher level bodies and a media authority of this kind would make this possible. For this reason, the composition of the media authority is, in our eyes, not ideal. You have clearly stated that you are prepared to change this and I hope that you do move in this direction. Otherwise, and I would like to make this quite clear, it is a Hungarian affair. Of course, there are other Member States whose media legislation we could mention in this context. This does not only relate to Hungary. I would like to say quite clearly with regard to your plans for the Council Presidency, firstly, that I welcome the fact that you have made promoting cultural diversity one of your overriding objectives. I believe that this is very important. I look forward to your initiatives to improve integration, including the integration of minorities, and you yourself have referred to the Roma. A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue. Secondly, I am pleased to see that you are committed to the enlargement negotiations and the policy with regard to our eastern neighbours. Bringing more Eastern European culture, together with the historical and social experience of the area, into the European Union can only be a good thing. For many reasons which I do not want to go into here, the European Union is still primarily a Western European institution. I would like to see your Council Presidency exerting a greater Eastern European influence. Thirdly, I will be interested to see how you handle the forthcoming reorganisation of agriculture and cohesion policy and the preparation of the European Union’s multiannual budgetary perspective. My group calls on you to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in all of this and we expect you take seriously your promise to support small and medium-sized businesses and to improve environmental protection, the sustainable use of resources and food security.

 Mr Barroso, we are all aware of how important the stability of the euro is. That being the case, there is one event that I found myself not quite able to understand. This was the debate about the increase for the rescue package, where you gave the green light but Chancellor Merkel gave the red one. My question, therefore, is whether you do not coordinate with one another at all. I appreciate that such things do happen sometimes, but this is not the first time that I have come across or heard about something like this. The media have taken a great interest in this in the meantime. Yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and Chancellor Merkel. It is an important political issue. I can understand that – believe me, I do not always see eye to eye with the Chancellor, either – but the issue concerns whether such publicly differing opinions do not help the financial speculators. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion, and the report. My question remains, however – on such an important issue, where the euro is being speculated on, at a point in time as important as this one, how can it be that your opinion comes across as uncoordinated with Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy or other Heads of Government? That is the public perception, in any case. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been dealing with the global economic and financial crisis for three years now. One of the conclusions to be drawn from this long-lasting discussion is that our measures are obviously not tackling the roots of the crisis, but simply treating the symptoms. I would like to repeat once again that decisions at EU level must not be determined by the financial markets. We must not allow the banks to get away largely scot-free, to continue speculating and to leave the Member States to take responsibility for the risky transactions that the banks have entered into. The tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause. This will restrict consumer spending and prevent the necessary economic upturn from taking place. Drastic savings measures will put other countries that are currently at risk, such as Portugal and Spain, in the same position as Greece and Ireland. Simply readjusting the financial instruments or putting new safety nets in place will not help. A permanent mechanism for preserving financial stability must include measures which regulate the activities of the markets. These include, among other things, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards. It is also important for us to change the statute of the European Central Bank to allow it to provide direct financial aid for ailing states, while circumventing the banks. These are the first steps we should be taking, but they are long overdue. To make the situation absolutely clear, a narrow-minded national approach is blocking the regulations needed for effective control of the financial markets. The Heads of State or Government are preventing us from making progress in the right direction. I include the Chancellor of Germany among them. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in response to Mr Schulz’s questions, you said that the Eurobonds proposal will probably not be successful. Previously, we were told that nothing would come of the financial transaction tax, and other proposals have also come to nothing. We are now in the third year following the financial crisis and I am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package – that would, of course, be an additional measure – or whether we have to expect that, by the weekend, yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others. My question is: how expensive is this delay, especially as it is clearly costing a lot of money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, I just have a brief additional question: are there any other instruments that are still under discussion? I feel rather poorly informed in this regard. Something needs to be done, and we are probably in agreement that the instruments that we have at our disposal should actually be used. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, if the Heads of State or Government have agreed to create a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area, I can only welcome that. The results of the work, lasting several months, of Mr Van Rompuy’s Task Force on economic governance leave a great deal to be desired – although my views on them vary. The attempt is being made to carry out as stringent a control on the budgets as possible in order to avoid long-term deficits, but the cautious recovery from the crisis will immediately be put at risk again by the radical cutting of public expenditure. That is not only completely counterproductive, I also think it is absurd. It seems that we have learnt nothing from our past experience with the Stability and Growth Pact. You cannot impose additional monetary penalties on a country that is already heavily in debt. The bail-out ban and the Stability and Growth Pact destroy the solidarity between the States in the monetary union. Does the economy dictate our policies? Once again, the consequences of the crisis will be borne by the people. We can expect wage dumping and social dumping, cuts in the education sector and a rise in unemployment. This will further increase the burden of the countries affected and make their recovery more difficult. It makes absolutely no sense to increase the pressure on countries like Ireland, Greece or Portugal. Rather, the large economic disparities in Europe should be reduced, in other words we need economic governance. We want a social and fair Europe, built on the principle of solidarity. The precedence of policy over economy must be retained or restored. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected. All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this. We also agree that we must provide aid quickly. A lot of sensible things have already been said. It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them. There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage. We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate. Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction. I would like to make one last point. We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon have emphasised the fact that it does away with the democratic deficit in the EU. In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control. The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard. I repeat: it is a minimum standard. This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism. It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets. New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent. When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament. The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States. Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe. The net contributors seem to have forgotten this. While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe. Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage. The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued. In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget. We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity. This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States. It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities. To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms.

 Mr President, I understand your economic questions, Mr Rübig, and they are very profound in economic terms, which I respect. However, I believe that this is about the relationship between the budget and the European Parliament and its rights. That is a different subject. It has to do with products, but in a quite different sense. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to admit that the Treaty of Lisbon and its social commitments read well. However, we cannot ignore the fact that hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Brussels and other European capitals. They were protesting against a mistaken and unsocial policy towards the crisis. We have hardly begun to turn the corner from this, the worst of crises, yet we are already hearing from many governments that national debts need to be reined in. The emergency parachutes that are the rescue plans need to be folded away, they say, and investment programmes abolished. The Commission is calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be tightened up. States in which reasonable wages and salaries are paid, in which the labour market still follows rules, or in which social security systems are too ‘social’ – which means too expensive – are to be penalised. The banksters are carrying on as if nothing had happened. Pensions and wages are to be cut, consumption taxes perhaps increased. Contributions to social health insurance are rising while services decline. In the light of the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking, Laval and Rueffert cases, it is not only the trade unions that fear that the social balance of the European Union is in a precarious position. The call of the trade unions for a social protection clause deserves our full support. Employee rights, trade union rights and social protection need to be given at least the same significance as – and, indeed, precedence over – the internal market and freedom to provide services. This needs to be clearly laid down in primary law. I am pointing out these facts because the relevant paragraphs merely look good – in reality, they change nothing. Human dignity cannot be ensured without minimum social standards. A social progress clause would improve the badly damaged reputation of the European Union amongst the populace and help to stem social fears. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have provided an impressive insight into the tasks of the various policy areas. Nevertheless, you, and all of us here, have to admit that the trust of European citizens is fading. Mr Verhofstadt has drawn our attention to this and so I will not address the matter in any more detail. These are reliable studies. Citizens have also seen rescue and economic recovery packages amounting to billions of euro flow to the so-called system-relevant banks, and they have seen dangerously high national debts pile up everywhere. Now they are asking themselves who is responsible for this, particularly when, despite a better economic outlook, they are being hit by the Member States’ austerity measures. These austerity measures will result in rising prices for public services, cuts in social benefits, cuts in education services, pay cuts, an extended working life in the face of uncertain pensions and often precarious employment situations. The protest goes far beyond the states hit by the crisis. Today, the unions are striking in France and on 29 September, strike action will be taken in many towns and cities in Europe against the Member States’ austerity policies. Citizens were promised that the Treaty of Lisbon would make the European Union more social and more democratic. The EU, including the Commission and the Parliament, would simply lose credibility if it now said that the Member States are responsible for the austerity measures. Effective financial market reforms, for example, like a ban on hedge funds, or a ban on speculation on raw materials and food derivatives, or even a financial transaction tax, but also the move away from the flexicurity ideology, are now most definitely the responsibility of the European Union. This is something that we all need to involve ourselves with over the next few months. The situation in the Union varies greatly for the different sections of the population and it is full of inconsistencies. The social division in the societies of the EU countries has, in any case, widened dangerously once again. In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, a large amount of money, billions of euro, have gone to rescue or to stand as security for the banks. It has not reached the people with real social needs or been put into education. No one would want to dispute or belittle the EU’s successes. However, papering over the very real inconsistencies in the European Union will not help anyone. I, too, would like to finish by saying something about the Roma in France. I believe that the European Union has a good tradition. However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values. These moral values and human rights apply to French, Polish, English, Spanish or German people in the European Union, just as they do for all Sinti and Roma who live in Europe.

 Mr President, I would like to come back to what Mr Barroso so rightly said against racism and xenophobia. However, in this regard, I would like to say that I am still not satisfied with the debate about the Roma, which we will, of course, continue this afternoon. There are side issues being debated that are extremely dangerous. In Germany, for example, we currently have the Sarrazin debate, which is extremely problematic. In this regard, the fact is being overlooked that in Germany, there are poorly educated sections of the population – of Germans, immigrants and also of Roma and nationals of other countries – who are all relatively poorly catered for in schools and we have insufficient means and a lack of smart methods to be able to really help these children. This breeds racism. Finally, I would like to say that sometimes, racism can arise unintentionally. I would not like to forget the debate about Greece. In this regard, I have seen things in my country, which is not particularly xenophobic, that I had not thought possible. We must remain sensitive to nationalistic, xenophobic and racist statements in the European Union. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for averting imminent crises, involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy, which entail rescuing the banks, on the one hand, and cuts in social security, salaries and pensions, on the other, we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. In our view, these proposals from the Commission on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact are taking the wrong tack. The Commission, following in the footsteps of the working group headed by President Van Rompuy, does not want to modify the Pact’s content, but instead wants to tighten the sanctions and enforce compliance. Both the Commission and Council are calling for further controls and penalties for Member States in deficit. This has not worked in the past and will not work in the future. However, we in the European Parliament’s Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left are pleased, at any rate, that the harshest penalties proposed by the Commission for countries in deficit were not applied. Regulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency. We will do our part to resolve the situation. Europe’s citizens already have to pay; the Council now ought finally to swing into action as well. The problems with the Stability and Growth Packet are not down to lack of compliance or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit to the Maastricht target of 3% of new debt. This may stall growth in the euro area, which is still feeble and at risk. The current economic imbalances in the EU must be eliminated, as this is what speculators are making their living from. One of the ways to do this is for the countries with strong economies to drop their aggressive export strategies which have devastating consequences for the other countries. These countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead. Criteria such as the unemployment rate and the prevalence of poverty must be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. What is needed is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the results of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday of last week must be measured against the global and European challenges that we are facing. Will it be possible to eliminate the causes of the unprecedented crisis in European financial markets at the beginning of May or at least to start taking steps in the right direction? What proposals are being made to the citizens of Europe and the financial markets to rectify the malfunctions in the system? The Council has proudly stated that the banks, which are responsible for causing the crisis, must pay part of the costs and their activities must be more strictly regulated. I welcome this, but in the meantime, I have stopped believing that it will actually happen. You have decided first of all on an international bank levy which does not have unanimous support even within the EU and which has been completely rejected by some G20 countries. It seems unrealistic to think that this decision could ever be implemented. Secondly, in the case of the introduction of a general financial transaction tax, there is only a requirement to investigate whether it is feasible. I doubt that this will really boost the confidence of the players on the global financial market or prevent speculation from taking place or cause the G20 to adopt a resolution on this subject. Thirdly, the stricter measures taken against deficit offenders in a financial and economic crisis are more likely to put the recovery at risk, reduce consumer spending and, in particular, cause socially deprived people to tighten their belts even further. As a result, a greater reduction in the state’s revenue base is inevitable. This will lead to additional austerity measures, which will call into question the financial viability of the Europe 2020 strategy that we have just adopted. Fourthly, no one is taking the opportunity to reinforce the Member States’ revenue base by introducing an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds and green taxes, by raising taxation on high incomes and assets and by ensuring the socially just distribution of taxes. I find this very strange. My fifth point is that the crisis is undermining the democratic foundations of our society. The regulations imposed by the EU on the countries in crisis are also contributing to this. Cuts in social security spending, in wages and pensions and in public services, together with the raising of the pension age, are all causing the poverty gap to widen and the number of people living in poverty to increase even further. I am very much opposed to this. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticism from our group is not directed at whether we need the newly created euro rescue package, but at how it will be implemented. As in 2009, it is once more all about rescuing the banks and the financial sector. Yet again, they will not be helping to pay the cost of averting imminent crises. The EU countries that are in difficulty are once more being ordered to make cuts in social security spending, in public investments, in public services and in salaries and pensions and to increase the pension age. The plan to tighten up the stability pact is pure sado-monetarism. Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are being asked to pay for the crisis which was caused by the failure of European economic policy and gambling on the financial markets. However, this orgy of cuts will send demand on the internal market and tax revenues in Europe through the floor and, as a result, the recession will return. From our perspective, this policy is fundamentally wrong and will not lead to healthy public finances. We are hearing once again that structural reforms should bring about increased growth. More deregulation is to be introduced into the labour markets and the European internal market, while public services will be privatised by means of public-private partnerships. As a result, industrial relations will end up in an even more uncertain and precarious position. This will cause an increase in poverty and social exclusion in the very year when we are supposed to be combating these two phenomena. This is what the Europe 2020 strategy is allegedly intended to fight against. Where will the investment in education, research, green jobs and combating poverty come from if all the Member States are adopting austerity programmes? To put it bluntly, the Europe 2020 strategy is not worth the paper which its very modest objectives are written on. Our group supports the protest campaigns by trade unions and social movements against the catastrophic course taken by the European Union. We agree with the European Trade Union Confederation that an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds, green taxes and heavy taxation of high incomes, assets and inheritances will allow for investment in the environmental and social reconstruction of our industrial societies. Firstly, Europe needs a European social and environmental programme of investment in the future to overcome the crisis. Secondly, it needs decisive measures to break the power of the financial markets and, thirdly, it needs European economic governance and more economic democracy in the interests of the workers. We must have a social Europe or there will soon be no common Europe left. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the most recent Council meetings indicate that far-reaching changes are under way. We are currently experiencing a process of governmentalisation of European policy. The Treaty of Lisbon praised the role of Parliament and the strengthening of that role. We have also spoken out in praise of this. Fundamental agreements are now being reached between the governments and inconceivably large amounts of money are being spent. Until now, the parliaments have had little say in the matter and we must put a stop to this. The method used by those in government has resulted in huge sums being spent to rescue banks which are themselves responsible for getting heavily into debt. These governments have saved casino capitalism using taxpayers’ money. However, they have taken a very hesitant approach to rescuing the states that are in debt. Somewhere, they managed to find EUR 750 billion. The question is whether the money printing press will save economic development. I believe that it is more likely to save the banks’ capital. However, the European Union must be more than just a free internal market with a single currency. Mr Barroso is right when he says that without an economic union, we can forget the monetary union. However, I cannot yet see any clear outlines. Persisting with the failed Stability and Growth Pact has relatively little to do with the sensible coordination of economic policy. What we are lacking is a social union. We are lacking the lasting and effective re-regulation of the financial sector. We are lacking a coordinated tax policy and wage policy and a tax on financial transactions. Although we have been talking about this tax for a long time, it remains just talk. It is time to safeguard the social state by means of the EU institutions, not to dismantle it. The Greeks and other nations are afraid because they can see the measures that are being taken on the social side. It is time to fight for the harmonisation of social standards at a high level. Hedge funds must be banned and tax havens abolished. We are making very slow progress in combating the crisis in the financial markets. In the light of the speed with which the speculators are acting, we are doing far too little. During emergencies like those that we are repeatedly being faced with, it is totally wrong to nationalise the billions which are being spent as losses and privatise the profits. The banks must not be allowed direct access to taxpayers’ money with the support of the state. Incidentally, one thing is clear to me, and that is that in the current conditions, we will have to redefine the term ‘bank robber’. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must, of course, provide assistance to Greece. However, the so-called rescue operation also has some absurd elements. With France and Germany acting like great powers, the process of reaching a decision on the assistance package was very expensive and protracted. For years, the financial markets have been increasingly deregulated and now everyone is surprised that it is expensive. Who will now pay the price for the political errors? The workers, ordinary citizens? Banks are not being placed under any obligation. No, once again it is the taxpayers who are to pick up the tab and dig deep in their pockets to pay for the profiteering of the banks. Once again, dependent workers are to have to accept pay cuts. With the dictates from the International Monetary Fund, any semblance of a democratic decision-making process has been eliminated. In the case of the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico, application of the polluter-pays principle has been called for. I believe that is right. Anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt. At the moment – at least in Germany – banks do not even have to pay back the debts that they have taken on and with which they are happily speculating against the euro – yes, against the euro. Furthermore, they are still speculating, even though we have been saying for a long time that something needs to be done about this. Proposals for what could be done are on the table. A ban on trading credit derivatives and on short selling, the introduction of a financial market transaction tax, special levies on bonuses in the financial sector, a legally binding bank and insurance levy – all of these proposals are on the table. Of course, Greece must also do its homework. Like other countries of the European Union, Greece should also tax wealth, combat corruption and reduce its arms expenditure. Mr Cohn-Bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this. I will therefore omit the facts in this regard and endorse what he said in his speech. I can understand people in Athens going out into the streets and protesting. What I cannot understand is the violence. I agree with everyone who has expressed sympathy for the victims, whose suffering is most regrettable. Violence will achieve the opposite of what the protesters and honest demonstrators want. We must call for an end to the violence. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, the decision made by the aviation safety authorities not to put passenger safety at risk was absolutely right, even if this meant closing European airspace for several days and involved financial losses for the airlines. In my opinion, it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk. What does ‘at their own risk’ actually mean in this case? I welcome the fact that the Commission is considering authorising special State aid for the airlines, which would otherwise be in serious financial difficulties as a result of the current situation. We will be talking later about employment in the European Union. If the EU and the Member States can at least help to prevent things from getting even worse, this is the right thing to do. However, in return for the provision of State aid, the airlines must give a binding undertaking not to make staff cuts or salary cuts. They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation. It is high time that the Commission put in place a permanent common European monitoring system for aviation safety. This monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping. I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach. Competition and the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to take priority over the safety of human lives. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr Barroso, you have spoken about your work programme and it has been discussed in Parliament. You have said that you want to follow up on the critical remarks. I have one question. Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it. However, I have the impression that very little has changed in the way the banks do business. I would also be interested to hear the answer to another question. Do you think that we and the Commission have done enough? If not, what do you believe it is still necessary to do in order to combat the causes of the financial crisis in the longer term, so that the banks cannot go on doing business in the way they currently are? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I have another brief question. The chair of Deutsche Bank, Dr Ackermann, is a difficult man to make an impression on. He has recently said outright that he wants to make returns of 25%. Do you not think that this flies in the face of the measures taken by the Commission and the individual governments? He is not changing anything. He has said that he wants to make returns of 25% once again. This is what Dr Ackermann, the chair of Deutsche Bank, which is an extremely important bank, is saying. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, it is a good thing that the Heads of State or Government were able to agree an emergency package, but this is hardly a really European solution. The German Government has, for tactical electoral reasons – with regard to North Rhine-Westphalia – gone quite far down the road of populism. The agreement, then, was hanging by the thread of the conversation between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. It is no package to cover the citizens. The objective of the funding mechanism is to consist, and I quote, of ‘incentives for the fastest possible return by the financial market to setting high-risk prices’. Economic policy coordination is to be built on the failed principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. The State and the citizens are to make savings, while the financial markets – the banks – are to evaluate whether enough savings have been made. I regard that as a dubious procedure. In the EU there is currently an unemployment rate of 10% – the highest since 1998. Over 20% of under-25-year-olds are out of work. There is a need to say very specifically where we want to make savings. Otherwise, I fear the worst. Why has the Council not agreed on an increase in the cohesion and structural funds or an immediate prohibition on trading credit derivatives? Why has it postponed agreement on specific targets to combat poverty in the EU indefinitely? I am not saying, incidentally, that they have done so deliberately, but to all intents and purposes the postponement will endure indefinitely. I consider that to be a scandal in this, the European Year for Combating Poverty. June this year is much too late. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, it is rare for me to agree with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission. However, when they both call for solidarity with Greece and warn of renationalisation, then I can only agree with them, because what they say is correct. Moreover, recently in Strasbourg, we heard Mr Barroso thinking aloud as to whether the worst of the speculation on the financial markets should be banned outright. The increasing social chasm in the European Union and within the Member States can no longer be overlooked by anyone, yet the pressing issues associated with this are not on the agenda of the Heads of State at their first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda. As you are aware, my group is not at all keen on this strategy as it has been drafted by the Commission, because it is based on the failed ideology of competition which led to the crisis. We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests. EU 2020 is miles away from this. It is quite something, however, when individual members of the Federal German Government turn up and thunder against the few binding goals of the EU 2020 strategy, such as for the employment quota, for research and education and for combating poverty – and that in the European Year for Combating Poverty! I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the Heads of Government. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr Barroso, last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy. It contains important objectives. The Council has now imposed an austerity programme on Greece, which, in my opinion, makes the achievement of these goals impossible, with one State having 3% of the gross domestic product of the EU. However, you continue to persist with the failed Stability and Growth Pact. At the same time, several Member States are calling for a European monetary fund or even economic governance. My questions are as follows. Are you going to review your EU 2020 proposal again in order to integrate the idea of the monetary fund and economic governance so as to initiate a move away from tax and wage dumping and from the prevailing competitive ideology? Are you going to take measures immediately, together with the Member States, to prohibit speculation against the euro by the very banks that have just been bailed out using taxpayers’ money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 I am not entirely satisfied. The issue is that taxpayers’ money is being used to speculate against the Greek State. Some of this taxpayers’ money comes from German banks and it has also been lent out by German banks. Yet, while we are repeatedly told that some sort of measures will be taken, nothing actually happens. I am therefore rather disappointed that so little has been done to simply prohibit certain things in the EU so as to put a stop to such speculation once and for all and allow us to genuinely concentrate on growth and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, in times of need, you discover who your friends are, as the saying goes. There are 27 governments in the European Union trying – each in its own way – to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries. This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens. The euphemistic wage restraint policy, reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age, family, sickness and desired education have all been mentioned. The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets. The banks have already made more progress than the states. Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank, which, in Germany, were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers’ money, are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of excessively expensive government bonds in Greece. Taxpayers’ money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal, honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer people are fleeing. (Heckling)
 Believe me, I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany. However, one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief, while at the same time, the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes. Who will have to find this money, though? I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet. Was it not Germany, formerly the world’s highest exporter, that years ago separated wage increases from productivity, thus resulting in social dumping? In ancient Greek theatre, a crisis means an opportunity – yes, the challenge of a turning point. In order to bring about such a turning point, we must demand that a statutory minimum wage finally be put in place. The same work in the same place must receive the same wage. We need harmonisation of tax types within the Union, but above all, we need genuine European regulation and control of the financial markets and a real European economic and finance policy, coordinated on the basis of solidarity, with binding social and environmental targets. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT agreement was negotiated on the basis of a dubious procedure and quickly pushed through only one day before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to circumvent Parliament. However, I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement. We have big brother’s little sister waiting for our approval. Mrs Clinton believes that she can persuade the Members of this Parliament to do something which we would not accept from our own governments. From my point of view, it is fundamentally wrong for alleged terrorism investigators to have such extensive access to databases, because this undermines people’s self-determination over their own personal data. Personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used. In addition, the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end. It will not be possible to take legal action to discover the whereabouts of the data or to claim damages for its illegal use by third countries. This gives the state precedence over its citizens, who will all be reduced to the status of objects of suspicion. The Member States are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the EU. To give some examples in Germany, should Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees? Will it now become the norm for the German Government to buy from tax investigators data that has been obtained illegally? We find ourselves in a situation in which Parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision. Why should Google be able to set data thresholds in future? It is important to combat terrorism and, in particular, its causes, and I believe that we all agree on this, but not at the cost of fundamental rights. In this context, I have heard many speeches which refer to the EU as a community of values. We are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in September 2009, I had to tell you that your political guidelines were continuing a failed Commission policy. Your neoliberal guidelines do not reveal a strategy for more social justice, nor do they provide better protection for Europe against crises. They provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe. Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme. You can expect no applause for this from my group. Already during this new parliamentary term, this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously, and I very much welcome that. I am thinking of the new Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission and of the rejection of one of the candidate Commissioners, and I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will once again be conscientious in its addressing of the SWIFT agreement. Transparency and fairness are vital in the agreements between the institutions – only when we have these can we begin to talk about policy. It is about the people of Europe and the rest of the world, it is about good jobs and more rights to a good education and fair pay, it is about their right to peaceful development and an intact environment. Therefore, Mr Barroso, my group will not support your guidelines or your staffing proposal. Prepare yourself for our harsh, but fair, exchange of views with you and your College. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group also participated actively in the hearings of the candidates. Some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on us. We are less enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolios. That also includes the rather mysterious – although perhaps soon to be less mysterious – area of responsibility of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is also Vice-President of the Commission. However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge. In this regard, all of our questions related primarily to political projects. In what direction should the European integration process go? Which measures are most important to the Commission candidate? There were far too many vague answers to these questions and answers that, politically speaking, we do not support. Despite claims of a more social Europe, they persisted in advocating a route towards deregulation, privatisation or the flexicurity concept. The flexibility of workers was the top priority and social security was right at the bottom. Climate protection is on the agenda, but we are not seeing a move away from coal-powered generation of electricity or from nuclear power. I do not see the EU taking a leading role in climate protection and in development aid. Nothing has been said about consistent disarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons within Europe. Mr Barroso, Mr President, as much as I appreciate the candidates coming forward for the hearing, my group is unable to give your College a positive vote. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency. I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU. On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy. However, even though it has been acknowledged that a new political approach is needed, where is it? I have not seen it. With the new Commission, the new Parliament and the President of the European Council, however, there would now be a chance to start a totally new debate. Of course, there is the new treaty and the still to be implemented opportunity for the citizens initiative, too. Our starting point is clear: our priority, above all others, in particular, above the interests of profits, must remain the social and environmental concerns of the people. That needs to become the new basic principle of the European Union’s strategies and legislation, as only then will the citizens perceive the EU as representing progress in the long term. My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax. In yesterday’s debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future. We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt. Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I have a question for you about the Tobin tax. This tax is a worthwhile proposal, but as yet, no one has introduced it. Everyone says that it will never be introduced unless all the Member States do so at the same time. I am now afraid, after the decision at the European summit, which I welcome, that this will once again be postponed, because we are not all starting at the same time. I would like to know what your opinion on this is and what you think are the chances of the Tobin tax being introduced. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to welcome the two candidates on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Above all, we welcome the fact that a woman has been elected. We assume that the two candidates for the high offices will not only focus on the content of their responsibilities, but will also develop a cooperative approach to Parliament. We expect the Council to deal more closely with the social issues resulting from the crisis and to draw the right conclusions. Billions have so far been paid to the bankers, but there has been virtually no help for the ordinary people. Mr Schulz is right when he says that the casino is open again, but at the same time, poverty and, in particular, child poverty is growing. Four million jobs were lost throughout Europe as a result of the crisis. According to reports from the Commission, this figure could increase to seven million over the course of the next year. We know that estimates of this kind are often lower than the real figures. For example, 1.5 million people in Germany are on short-time work and it is important to emphasise this. However, growing unemployment and poverty are the first signs of even greater inequality of opportunity which will have a major impact on educational opportunities. We also need to discuss this subject. The question that arises is whether the Heads of State or Government will find ways out of the crisis which combine the European concept of integration with social progress and which have a real impact for the citizens of Europe. Instead of exit strategies for the economic recovery programmes and mandatory budget consolidation, we need a change of policy. I have just three observations to make about this. Firstly, we expect the Council to give a statement on its position on the plans for the 2020 strategy, which is intended to replace the failed Lisbon Strategy. Innovation and knowledge, combating exclusion, green economic strategies, a digital Europe – as a list of slogans, this does not sound too bad. However, we urgently need concrete proposals describing how all of this will be implemented. Secondly, the Council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets. I have a number of legitimate questions about how the Council can bring this into line with existing treaties, because in some cases, restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments are not permitted or wanted. We are interested to see how you will achieve this. Thirdly, I would like to emphasise once again that the Council must give a clear signal after Copenhagen that a binding climate change agreement is needed. Voluntary commitments have never achieved the desired objective. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 What I found pleasing about the special summit was that there was a gender balance. We would like to pay tribute to that achievement. I would also like to add that we will continue to support you if you continue to maintain this gender balance. We now have two new figureheads for the European Union to deal with, about whom all sides have said that they will have to grow into their roles. That, of course, will always be the case. There is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights. I see it like this: today’s lightweights are tomorrow’s heavyweights, and vice versa
. Many a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next. That notwithstanding, we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome. The social consequences, especially, are giving us lots to deal with. In Europe, tens of millions of people are affected by unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The number of crisis victims is going through the roof. In the developing world, the consequences are much worse. Are you prepared, Mr Barroso, together with the new Commission, to learn the lessons of the wrong turns taken through radical free-market policies? Are you prepared to bring about an urgently needed change of policy to put people ahead of profits and social interests ahead of competitive ones? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by all 27 Member States. Many will be celebrating this as a great success, but my group will not be joining in these celebrations. I have stated the reasons for this many times in this House and I do not intend to do so again. Unfortunately, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply for the citizens of three Member States gives me doubts about the EU’s great progress in the protection of fundamental rights. I mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and Václav Havel’s speech. However, precisely because the Left in Europe wants a social, peaceful and environmentally sustainable European integration, we will also continue to use the framework provided by the treaty for this purpose. We have done this up to now, and we will continue to do so. In this connection, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament will now have more rights. Amidst all the rejoicing, the Heads of State or Government would also have been well advised to use their recent summit for more tangible policies. The greatest challenge facing the world is climate change. In the run-up to the world climate conference in Copenhagen, the European Union has, unfortunately, lost the leading role that it had set itself. For one thing, the substance of the commitments to reduce CO2
 emissions does not correspond to what is actually needed. Moreover, it is unacceptable that the EU Member States quite clearly want to avoid their financial responsibilities, even though this is a situation where we cannot afford to delay our action. It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine-growing region – although I do not begrudge you that. It is quite simply about survival and, incidentally, also about peace in our world. Climate change is already causing poverty and hunger and forcing millions of people to flee from their homelands. Everyone in this Chamber has surely spoken at one time or another of global challenges that cannot be overcome at national level. Climate protection, peace and combating poverty are just such challenges. If the European Union does not act in a consistent and exemplary manner in this regard, it will lose its acceptance as an international player. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, there has been much speculation over staffing issues during the last three months and over the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which my group has rejected for three good reasons. In simplistic terms, firstly we want priority to be given to a social Europe rather than to a radical market orientation. Secondly, we want disarmament instead of the development of military capabilities and, thirdly, we want more direct democracy rather than a Europe made up of elites. We should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content. While we are arguing over names and positions, more and more people are losing their jobs. The banks have, of course, been rescued. At the same time, Mr Barroso is calling for us to bring an end to the economic recovery plans soon – yesterday the deadline was set for 2011 – and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be reduced quickly. This will mean reductions in salaries and pensions, cuts in public services and social security provision, higher value added tax and a lack of collective agreements. One current example of this can be found in the German commercial cleaning industry where workers have been on strike for three days. These are the problems which are affecting people in Europe and these are the problems which the Council should be dealing with. Instead of this, the main subject of concern is adding clauses to the Treaty of Lisbon to encourage the Czech President to sign it. If this is really as simple as it seems to be in practice, I would ask the Heads of Government to think more carefully about a social progress clause in the Treaty of Lisbon. That would be much more appropriate. At the beginning of the parliamentary term, a series of positive proposals were made concerning a more social EU policy. This did not just relate to the social progress clause. It was also about a new economic recovery plan for Europe in order to create and retain jobs and about increased investment and sustainable environmental growth. A European Employment Pact for more and better jobs, for equal pay, for more rights for employees and better working conditions was called for. There were discussions about increased solidarity among the Member States and ensuring the sustainability of the social security and pension systems. I have not yet identified any strategy within the policies of the Member States or the policies of the Commission which might lead us towards these objectives. Of course, the Council must now consider the appointments to the new Commission and the possible changes to the Treaty of Lisbon. However, the focus must be on the problems I have referred to and on their solutions. My group’s vote on the College of Commissioners will be dependent on this. Lothar Bisky,  
Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, you are calling for us to leave behind the economic stimulus programmes soon and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be quickly reduced. Yet even your most recent forecast promises growth in EU GDP of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009 as a whole, that would represent a 4% decrease. According to your own forecasts, unemployment rates in the EU will rise to over 11% in 2010. Do you not think that early, drastic cuts in public expenditure could stop the small beginnings of recovery in their tracks? Or do you believe that the financial sector, for the moment, has got over the problem and the ordinary people should bear the costs of the crisis? Already, you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia, Hungary and Romania: lower wages, lower pension benefits, fewer public services and higher VAT. Is that your idea of a social Europe? Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated mandatory referendums on the Reform Treaty throughout Europe. Voters in Ireland were the only ones with the opportunity to make their decision directly a year and a half ago. If we want the people to decide, then we must accept the result, even if we do not like it. The government in Ireland went against the principle of democracy and conducted a second referendum, partly as a result of pressure from other Member States. Now they have the result they wanted. We on the Left abide by the principle of democracy, but our concern over the political orientation of the EU remains. The number of ‘no’ votes in Ireland indicates that we are not the only ones with this concern. Our three main points of criticism are, firstly, that the previous policy of liberalising the financial markets, tax competition, decoupling of financial policy from economic policy and the dismantling of the social state contributed to the economic and financial crisis. As a result, this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in Europe. Other than declarations of intent, very little has happened so far in terms of the regulation of the financial markets. On the contrary, while the unemployment figures are rising, the big banks are once again expecting large profits. The Treaty of Lisbon will continue this market economy policy with free competition. This is something that we cannot support. Instead, we call for a fundamentally different approach to tackling social challenges. Our aim is the introduction of a social progress clause with minimum wages applying throughout the EU – the same pay for the same work in the same place. We must combat wage dumping. Our second point of criticism is that the call for the Member States to gradually improve their military capabilities is incompatible with the aims of the Left, as is the entrenchment of a European armaments agency in primary European law. We will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests. We do not want this kind of treaty; we want a treaty of disarmament rather than armament. It is paradoxical to be referred to as an opponent of Europe for this reason. Anyone in Europe who is in favour of armament is classed as a friend of Europe, but anyone in Europe who is in favour of disarmament is classed as an enemy of Europe. That is politically absurd! So, the referendum in Ireland has taken place and, even if it did not turn out exactly as we would have wanted, we on the Left will continue to work to achieve more direct democracy in Europe. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you represent the continuity of a policy, Mr Barroso, which has contributed to the greatest economic crisis in post-war history. While the casinos in the major financial centres are reopening, the citizens of the world are footing the bill. The consequences of the crisis are unemployment, poverty, lower incomes and less education. You maintain that the financial crisis came primarily from the US and that it was only the bankers who caused the collapse. We say that the political system, including the policies of the EU Commission, was responsible for promoting casino capitalism. The ideology of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation has led to the crisis. Continuing as we have done in the past will result in an even more serious crisis. The political system must take responsibility, learn from its mistakes and give up its neo-liberal ideals. European policy must focus consistently on the interests of the people of Europe. I cannot identify a focus of this kind in your guidelines. However, I am pleased that in your remarks today, social issues were given greater importance than was the case a year ago. I would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples. You want to adhere to the Lisbon strategy. However, the people of Europe need good jobs at wages which will allow them to live with dignity. We need to put on the agenda a reduction and not an extension of working hours. We expect the new Commission to restructure the Posting of Workers Directive. Europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach. For this reason, we have proposed, together with some others, a legally binding clause on social progress and a charter of public services, which will give precedence to social security and services of general interest over internal market regulations. From what you have said, I understand that you do not think much of this. In the Zimmermann report, the European Parliament calls for a minimum wage of at least 60% of the average income in all Member States. You maintain that you can do nothing about this. I think that you could, for example, by means of the employment policy guidelines. You are focusing solely on the Stability and Growth Pact which has proved to be an ineffective tool, in particular, during the crisis. We want a social pact to replace the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact. You believe that a few new financial supervision regulations will keep the greed of the financial world in check. We are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements. You, and I quote, ‘support every paragraph of the Treaty of Lisbon’. We want a social Europe instead of a continuation of the radical focus on the internal market. We want a commitment to disarmament and civil conflict management instead of the continuing growth in military capability. You see Europe as a leading power and we want to spread the ideology of free trade and marketisation of all areas of life throughout the world. We stand for intercultural, multilateral dialogue and the greatest possible support for developing countries in overcoming the economic, food, financial and climate crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, let us elect a Commission together which sets itself the objective of a social, peaceful, economically sustainable and democratic European Union. If we want to gain acceptance among the people of Europe for the EU project, we need a break with radical free-market concepts and more direct democracy. In this case, Mr Barroso is the wrong man for the job of president. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has presented an ambitious work programme which includes a proposal for more transparency. Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing. Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy. The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis. They are innocent parties. Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis. I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers. Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism. We are keen to see what happens with the Baltic Sea Strategy and I would be behind the President-in-Office of the Council if he were to focus on dialogue with Russia. We would also like the European Union to support the pledges of President Obama and President Medvedev with regard to the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The European Union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament. The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers. Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy. This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars. Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place. The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures. We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries. We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment. I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, I am pleased that a neighbour from Poland has become President of this House. I come from eastern Germany and work near Słubice. Słubice and Frankfurt/Oder are both part of a united Europe. I would like to thank you for focusing in particular on the continued integration of Eastern and Western Europe. There is still much to do in this respect, as we are all aware. However, I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe. I hope that I will soon be able to speak to you in more depth. I have started to work towards this. Two of my sons speak Polish. I once had the honour of presenting the Andrzej Wajda film prize to the director Andreas Dresen and of making a speech to mark the occasion. Andrzej Wajda and other Polish directors are part of our European culture. I hope that Western Europe and Eastern Europe will not forget the special achievements of Eastern European culture.

 I rejected the report because it advocates a further militarisation of the EU and demands military autonomy via increased investment in armament, defence and military sectors despite the financial and economic crisis. It also calls for the expansion of military (training) operations and further strengthens EU-NATO cooperation. It encourages the use of development aid (European Development Fund) to finance security operations, supports and encourages further civil-military cooperation and advocates subordination of policy areas under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and fosters the Military Industrial Complex (MIC). It supports and presses for the ATHENA mechanism and use of battle-groups. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject this report because the mutual defence clause (Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union) turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) paves the way for military interventions within the EU. The explicit ‘obligation’ to react ‘by all means’ in case of armed aggression against a Member State goes beyond NATO’s mutual assistance clause since non-armed attacks are also covered. Within the solidarity clause, military support is also demanded in case of terror attacks, natural or man-made disasters, which implies military operations within the EU. Cyber attacks, pandemics and energy shortages can also lead to activation of the solidarity clause. I voted against the report since there is no clear definition of what falls under the solidarity clause and whether social unrest/strikes are also considered ‘man-made disasters’. Furthermore, the report prefers military to civil measures outside and inside the EU, and focuses only on EU defence and military solutions. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject the report because it advocates the militarisation of cyber security and regards the existing civil approach as inadequate, even though the risk is relatively low.

 Although the report is based on the correct assumption that climate change can exacerbate existing conflicts, it wrongly focuses on repressive and military counter-measures whilst advocating further EU militarisation. I reject the report because it promotes systematic implementation of military elements into climate policy, financing from the EU budget of military measures linked to climate change, and further closer coordination and cooperation of EU and NATO as well as a special focus on development of military capabilities, pooling and sharing, including the merge of civil and military assets and capabilities. Current conflicts in developing countries can only be solved effectively, also with regard to climate change, if the underlying root causes of global distributive inequity are addressed; the military is the wrong solution.

Mr President, the EU has won the Nobel Peace Prize, and I would not wish to question its achievements, such as its role in reconciliation after the Second World War. However, the reports before us speak a different language. The mutual defence clause, in effect, turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause includes the option of military intervention in Member States in response to man-made disasters. Let me ask the House this: would a Europe-wide general strike constitute such a man-made disaster? Will soldiers from Germany soon be deployed against striking workers in Greece? The implementation of the demands set out in the Annual Report on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would mean a quantum leap in the EU’s military development and an expansion of military intervention worldwide, probably with a robust mandate.  Much of this, including Member States’ obligation to develop their military capabilities, has to do with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Let me say this: the Left in Europe did the right thing by rejecting this Treaty and we will continue their tireless efforts to bring about an amendment of these Treaty provisions. Sabine Lösing,

Madam President, over recent years, the international arms trade has grown further, and the countries of the European Union can once again claim a dubious success: at 34%, they have the leading share of the trade. Many of these exports go to countries with – and I word this carefully – a dubious human rights record, and into conflict areas. That is why there needs to be a complete ban on arms trading, especially in relation to conflict regions. The current negotiations at UN level on an Arms Trade Treaty represent a step in the right direction. We continue to hope that the treaty will not later turn out to be a paper tiger as toothless as previous agreements. For that reason, following a successful conclusion of the treaty, implementation needs to remain on the political agenda consistently. The constructive, cross-group cooperation on the current resolution is a good sign, and one that I am pleased about. It is therefore all the more disappointing that we were unable to avoid the positive reference to the arms industry in paragraph 2 of the resolution. Aside from the moral aspects, I would like to point out that studies have concluded beyond doubt that the influence of military expenditure on jobs is very low in comparison with other public spending. Rather than jobs, it is mostly about ensuring the profits of this branch of industry, the more so given that disarmament and conversion could promote sustainable development, growth and jobs.

 Mr President, ‘yet another war over oil’: that could be the heading for an intervention on the current conflict in Sudan. Once again, the civilian population of both countries are enduring indescribable suffering. All violent attacks and assaults are naturally to be condemned, and naturally we must call for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, that does not absolve us from talking about the causes, or from looking back critically at whether the EU’s clear commitment to the splitting off of South Sudan was responsible given the current circumstances. There will be no quick solution; that much is certain. It is also certain, however, that the problems cannot be resolved by means of armed conflict. Right now, it is essential that we maintain the arms embargo that in fact exists, in order to prevent further escalations. I would like to remind you that in 2004, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Sudan and, in 2011, also to South Sudan, but this was unilaterally relaxed in November 2011 to support security sector reform in South Sudan. However difficult it may be, we need to push for diplomatic negotiations. If the international community wants to help end the conflict, it must do so in the role of a neutral mediator, not led by its own interests. The role that the EU has played has not been neutral. I am very concerned as to whether there will be more such scenarios in future, whether we will see more natural resource-rich regions of Africa splitting off and a spiralling of state disintegration. The foreign policy instrument of state building must not be allowed to be an instrument of such a development. Using access to reserves of natural resources to guide us in our foreign policy activities will bring not peace, but rather death and misery. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, nuclear weapons are among the vilest weapons there are and they should be abolished worldwide. Civil use of nuclear energy is impossible to control. We therefore need to do everything we can to ensure that there is a worldwide move away from nuclear power and towards global nuclear disarmament, and specifically in this case towards a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East – and we must do so in a peaceful way. Until then, the current treaties will apply. As worthy of criticism as the regime in Iran is, it should be noted that, unlike India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It therefore exercises the right to the civil use of nuclear energy guaranteed to all states that have signed this Treaty. That is dangerous – just as it is dangerous in other countries. No one thinks – quite rightly – of taking military action against all the states that have nuclear power plants, or penalising them with sanctions. Neither the secret services nor the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency provide solid evidence that Iran is building, preparing or planning nuclear weapons. Yet blatant threats of war have been made against Iran for many years on precisely this pretext. In addition, there is an increasingly aggressive economic war being waged with the intention of destabilising the country. This policy, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious danger to world peace and limits the opportunities for progressive opposition in Iran. As is so often the case, it seems very much as though peace and human rights are to fall victim to the global interests of the United States and the EU.

 Mr President, today’s discussion takes place against the background of the economic and financial crisis which has deprived many people of their livelihood, their rights and their democracy, and against the background of the thousands of people, in particular children, who are dying of hunger throughout the world. If we are to make savings in Europe, then we should cut our defence spending. Defence means defence against territorial attacks, so it is good that we can say: Yes, we can make savings in this area. However, even if I were to accept the prevailing logic and to assume that our defence requirements are at a very high level, it seems to me that the aim here is to reach a higher level of military capability under the guise of pressure on costs and to give the defence industry a better and more reliable source of income. I think that the scenario of a defence capability under threat is being exaggerated. I would like to mention here that it is not true that cuts in defence spending will lead to a rise in unemployment. That is simply not the case. However, high levels of defence spending do not only involve huge sums of money which are needed elsewhere. The proposals in Mr Lisek’s report also mean putting democracy at risk, for example, by means of the ATHENA mechanism, which is not subject to democratic controls, or by combining civilian and military capabilities. We will be voting against this report. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, have tabled a minority opinion, which calls, among other things, for radical disarmament and a purely civilian EU.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I welcome the excellent cross-party cooperation and majority support for the joint resolution on banning cluster munitions. The resolution constitutes an important and strong signal in the fight against these deadly weapons. We must not forget that cluster munitions and bombs were used in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, and – I would like to remind this Parliament – also by EU Member States. There is no justification for continuing to use these weapons or to store or produce them – none whatsoever – not for defence and not for protecting borders. I urgently call on all Member States not to support the proposed draft text of the new Protocol VI to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. This draft would entail a dramatic step backwards. This draft text prohibits – and this cannot be said clearly enough – cluster munitions and bombs made prior to 1980. That would mean that cluster munitions produced after this date would continue to be permitted and could also continue to be used in future. That is something that we must not accept. The Convention on Cluster Munitions that entered into force in August 2010 prohibits all cluster bombs and munitions, and that must be the benchmark.

− Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a wider scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 I voted against this report as I reject the notion that, if in doubt, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief should be tackled from within the framework of the common security and defence policy (CSDP). What is more, there must not be any mixing of civilian and military activities, something that this report would make possible. I furthermore strongly reject the introduction of security policy elements into the areas of civil protection and humanitarian assistance on the strength of any purported threat of terrorism. I advocate civilian disaster relief independent of security policy concerns and argue for the build-up of the necessary logistical capabilities, which must be independent of the military. Moreover, I would point out that the report refers to the solidarity clause in a positive light, a clause which, for example, also makes military intervention against striking workers possible.

 Mr President, in Israel, too, thousands are demonstrating for social justice and democracy and indicating the connection between their desperate social situation, settlement policy and the huge military expenditure. The policies of those in power in Israel are directed against the Palestinians and also against their own people. The establishment of peace in the region is therefore in the interests of the people of both Israel and Palestine and of world peace – and urgently so. Anyone who does not support the inclusion of Palestine in the United Nations is not doing what is necessary for the security of the people in Israel and Palestine. All forces in Europe must work to obtain a two-state solution, and political decisions must be taken. The recognition of Palestine’s diplomatic representations as embassies in all European States would improve the status of Palestine under international law. All European States must insist that the settlements, which contravene international law, be stopped. Only the equality of the Israeli and the Palestinian people can bring peace and social justice for everyone and marginalise radical forces. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, there is no other policy area where the European Parliament has so few rights of codecision as in the fields of foreign and, especially, of military policy. When it comes to EU military operations, it is the Heads of State or Government alone, meeting in the European Council, who make the decisions. When it comes to the key issue of war and peace, then, the European Parliament has absolutely no right to be heard or even to oversee. There is not even a binding rule that Parliament must be informed before the Union launches a foreign intervention. In light of the establishment of the European External Action Service, which, in practice, has become the executive arm of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), and of the start-up fund for military operations, which has a firm basis in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is a need for more monitoring powers for the national parliaments and for the European Parliament, and for these powers to actually be effective. The resolution on the table does state that the cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament needs to be improved, but there is a definite lack of specific proposals as to how that can be done. The interparliamentary assembly that we have proposed – to be composed of representatives from both national and European level – could pave the way for the resolution or at least attenuation of glaring democratic deficits. Such an interparliamentary assembly need not be composed of all the parties represented in the parliaments in order to ensure real and democratic supervision of European foreign and security policy. It would be nice if our amendments enacting this were to be approved tomorrow. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, in February, many people, including in this House, were full of both hope and concern about the future of Sudan. There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes. It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support. Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again. The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns. I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states. A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however. If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to. Aid for Sudan must be impartial and not tied to any one interest group. It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid. In order to prevent further fuelling of the conflict, all supplying of weapons must be halted. We are calling for an end to all civil/military collaboration and to the military training mission.

 Mr President, in a deeply divided country like Côte d’Ivoire, can a lasting peace be brought about by violent means and can the winner of the presidential election be legitimised? This seems extremely doubtful, especially as the real causes of the conflict have not been resolved. The country was destabilised as a result of economic problems brought about largely by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank. The sanctions which were rapidly imposed with the aim of weakening the Gbagbo government have exacerbated the situation and given rise to a humanitarian crisis in Côte d’Ivoire. The legitimacy of both claimants to the presidency is in dispute. The armies of both sides are responsible for massacring the civilian population. Once again, the West has taken sides and now the United Nations (UN) is waging war alongside French troops to try to ensure the victory of one side in the conflict. Will European powers once again be deciding the fate of African people as they did in colonial times, but this time with the support of the UN? What has happened to the principles of international law? Is this the concept on which the UN was founded? Instead of aiming for peaceful solutions to conflicts, the UN seems to be supporting civil wars or taking sides in them. Whose interest is this in? Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, the Belder report has been considerably improved by the amendments, and my group can agree with a great number of statements. Unfortunately, for all that they are correct, it primarily contains descriptions of the situation, but the underlying philosophy of a realistic future perspective has not been developed. The human rights situation in Iran is intolerable. However, sanctions will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation. In order to promote democratisation in Iran, we must do everything we can to make the international situation less tense. Worsening international relations brings with it the danger that further anti-democratic measures will be taken inside Iran, which will result in weakening the opposition. A policy of detente would also have to put an end to every form of threatening behaviour. Negotiations and international relations can only be successful if diplomatic recognition of all partners is a given. Only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved. I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution, and on the grounds that I have described, I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected.

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, will the situation now improve for the people in Southern Sudan or is the split more in the interests of the West so that we can get control of the oil reserves? In any case, the South has huge challenges ahead. Without a functional infrastructure and with the current disastrous economic situation, civilian assistance and humanitarian aid will be needed for a long time. Unfortunately, the danger of violent conflicts has probably not been eliminated for certain. However, experts believe that this cannot be resolved by military means. On the contrary, a focus on military means prevents a real solution to the conflicts being found. The necessary civilian assistance can be provided much more efficiently without military involvement. The transfer of civilian tasks to the military hinders the sustainable development of civilian structures. An example of this is Darfur. A massive military apparatus has now taken over the tasks of humanitarian and development organisations there, something that has been sharply criticised by these organisations. Our demands are that the focus be on purely civilian conflict management and assistance measures, in other words a reduction of the UN mission to the civilian components and no potential use of EU battle groups. In addition, in terms of a development perspective we call for Sudan’s debt be written off. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, many thanks to Mr Gahler for his report. It is clear, also from this report, that there is enormous interest in the natural resources of the Arctic region. As a result of climate change, oil and gas and other resources can be extracted increasingly easily. The issue of making better use of shipping routes has already been discussed. The logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region. Industrial development – in particular, through the extraction of oil and gas, the expansion of commercial fishing and increased shipping traffic – will all necessarily lead to the disturbance, or perhaps even destruction, of this highly sensitive ecosystem, with devastating consequences. Unfortunately, this report deals in generalities and does not contain any effective strategies for combating these dangers. A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic. The bordering states of Russia and NATO members USA, Canada, Denmark and Norway have already begun militarising the Arctic region and intend to protect their interests there. Climate change has led to this situation in the Arctic. We need to prevent the catastrophic progress of this change, something that can only be achieved through a rapid changeover to renewable energy sources. However, this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot. In common with numerous environmental organisations, we are calling for a moratorium on new oil extraction projects in the Arctic. A treaty needs to be agreed – similar to the Treaty on the Antarctic – that prohibits the extraction of mineral resources in the region. Last but not least, we are calling for the immediate demilitarisation of the region and therefore for the establishment of the Arctic as a demilitarised zone. Because my group and I are unable to support the results of the own-initiative report presented here, the GUE/NGL has submitted an alternative report.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of that and, of course, it is not possible to impose this from above. The question remains, however: Who was consulted? Which states are involved? Which indigenous peoples are affected? Was there any consultation with the people who may benefit from the situation, or with those who may lose their livelihood? I think that further dialogue is needed. The talks held so far are not enough. We need to try to keep this dialogue as broad as possible, also consulting with wider sections of society, possibly including the indigenous peoples in particular. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, what is this all about? Is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism? This is an important question when it comes to assessing the situation. Experts on this region are of the opinion that this is more to do with crime than with religiously motivated international terrorism. Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests. It may be that this is also about Africa as one of the areas in which Europe is interested. In the words of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, it concerns Africa as Europe’s backyard. I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa. The Sahel region can only be made secure by improving the situation of the population. Increasing security and military budgets in countries where the population is suffering from an acute food shortage is a disastrous move. Finally, I would like you to consider the fact that kidnapping and other crimes are a business in which many people are involved in a confusing array of organisations. Western funding for security structures could have a counterproductive effect on efforts to combat crime and could continue putting innocent people at risk in future.

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences. However, women’s rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions. The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women’s rights. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true. The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war. The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations. Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare. I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence.

 Mr President, it is important to make clear at this point that, when it comes to the EU’s foreign policy financing instruments, the Treaty of Lisbon abolished the European Parliament’s right of supervision. In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service. I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union’s far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation. We support Parliament’s cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments. Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier. All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy.

 I condemn the mass rapes and serious violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the strongest possible terms. I very much welcome the inclusion and adoption of this condemnation in the joint motion for a resolution. I voted against the joint motion for a resolution, however, because, to a large extent, Congolese military and police units trained by the EU’s EUPOL and EUSEC missions since 2005 were, and are, also involved in these crimes. The joint motion for a resolution expressly supports and welcomes these training missions. I am in favour of the immediate cessation of these missions, as they have contributed in a negative way to the escalation of violence and to the situation in the country by training security forces that have been repeatedly involved in the serious violations of the human rights of the Congolese people. In addition, the army and police trained by the EU support the repressive apparatus of the corrupt Kabila regime. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in 2000, the European Union clearly stated in the Lisbon strategy its objective of becoming the leading economic power in the world by 2010. We have failed to meet this target in many areas, but not as far as arms exports from the EU are concerned. In the period from 2005 to 2009, the EU Member States overtook the United States and became the world’s leading arms exporters. I think that this development is highly questionable. Obviously, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was never legally binding and which included a restrictive export licensing practice, consisted of empty words. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was converted into a common position in December 2008. However, we still have no effective sanction mechanisms. For example, long before 2008, Germany recognised the Code of Conduct as being legally binding. Despite this, Germany is now the third largest arms exporter in the world and supplies arms to crisis regions such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In addition, the arms export reports which the Member States submit to the Council are not uniform and often not transparent. We urgently need standardisation in this area, so that all the relevant arms exports are traceable and can be subjected to critical evaluation. Unfortunately, almost no efforts are being made to standardise these reports. In any case, I doubt whether it is possible to have a system of ethically sound arms exports. However, one thing is certain and that is that the European Union is currently a very long way from achieving this.

 Unfortunately, the joint resolution’s recitals contain a positive reference to the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which I and my group reject. But due to the very high importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries I and the GUE/NGL group signed the joint resolution on the entry into force of the CCM and the role of the EU, as this joint resolution must be seen as a great success in order to ban cluster munitions. Sabine Lösing,

Madam President, I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions, which I expressly support. As already explained, cluster munitions are indeed among the most brutal weapons in existence. They were certainly still in use by some EU Member States and the USA until recently. I could mention the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. It is quite shocking that – as has already been stated – statistically, the victims of cluster bombs and cluster munitions are 98% civilians, 27% of whom are children. How are we to view the prospects for the continued use of these weapons? It is certainly remarkable that Deutsche Bank is investing in the production of these dreadful weapons through its subsidiaries. It has been proven that business relations exist between Deutsche Bank and leading suppliers and manufacturers of cluster munitions, including L-3 Communications and Lockheed Martin. I find it shameless and inhumane to knowingly seek to make money from the death of civilians. The use, production, storage and transport of these weapons must be prohibited; the same goes for the trade in such weapons. For this reason, all EU Member States, along with all other countries, must sign and ratify the agreement on cluster munitions in full by August of this year or, if this is not possible, as Mr Gahler has stated, they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity. There should also be a moratorium on the use, production and distribution of cluster munitions until the agreement is ratified and work should begin as quickly as possible to destroy the existing stockpiles of cluster munitions. I am very pleased with this cross-party cooperation and support for the agreement on cluster munitions in the form of this joint resolution and welcome it on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. We believe that this resolution represents a major success in the fight against these murderous weapons. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to make clear at this point that we are deeply concerned about the development of EU foreign policy towards militarisation and an increasingly interventionist policy. That is a dangerous development. I want to say, in all clarity, that we believe that a military approach to conflict resolution or to the supposed stabilisation of countries or regions is absolutely the wrong way to go to achieve greater security for the EU and the world. Military interventions – and Afghanistan, unfortunately, is a very current example of this – bring suffering, death and prolonged devastation, but no peace and no improvement in the situation as far as the resident population is concerned. The Danjean report lists what are referred to as key threats that constitute a challenge for the EU’s future security policy. One of these is climate change – something that has been overwhelmingly caused by the industrialised nations of the West. If people in the countries of the South have to take flight because they no longer have any water and food becomes scarcer and scarcer, they will represent a security problem for Europe. Such a view is cynical and inhuman. If States collapse as a result of neoliberal economic policy, they will constitute a security problem. What we need is not more military, it is a change, an end to the European Union’s neoliberal orientation. The European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the creation of a crisis management and planning directorate and the planned start-up fund to fund military operations are designed to make the EU a global player in military terms. We believe that moves towards centralisation in the European External Action Service are a dangerous and undemocratic development. The EU should assume a leading role in relation to demilitarisation and disarmament, especially in the field of nuclear disarmament. There needs to be a push for the obligation incumbent upon nuclear States under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which is to say, complete nuclear disarmament, to be honoured at long last. This was a key promise that constituted the basis on which many States signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and have, as a result, durably refrained from acquiring nuclear weapons. Reliable guarantees of non-aggression are the best means of preventing proliferation as, otherwise, countries threatened with intervention will attempt to deter such an attack by means of acquiring nuclear weapons. If nothing else, I would like, in this context, and in particular with regard to Iran, to point out and to warn that military operations or military activities of any kind to prevent proliferation are completely counter-productive and highly dangerous. We will be rejecting the Danjean report and have tabled our own resolution on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL
),

– I am fully aware that international nuclear disarmament, and therefore the strengthening of the NPT and its ratification by all states, are of vital importance and that every effort should be made to implement the treaty in all its aspects. To ensure effective multilateral efforts, they must be set within a well-developed vision of achieving a nuclear weapon-free world at the earliest date possible. We must insist on the commitment of the nuclear weapons states under Article VI of the NPT to disarm completely, as it was a key promise and so many countries have signed the NPT and thus forego nuclear weapons permanently. We oppose the phrase in this joint resolution (Recital G): ‘... making use of all instruments at its disposal to prevent ...’. I warn, in particular regarding Iran, that any military activity to prevent proliferation is completely counterproductive and highly dangerous. I am convinced that the best way to deal with the problem of proliferation would be to abandon atomic energy once and for all, as its civilian use bears great dangers on its own and, moreover, it cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty that civilian nuclear technology will not be used for military purposes.

 Mr President, we believe that the item on Madagascar is not particularly important today. We would therefore ask that that time slot be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Afro-American journalist who was found guilty of murdering a policeman in 1982, following a trial based on circumstantial evidence. Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years. Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated. In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know. Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January. The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever. We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.

Madam President, the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror. At this point in time, however, the strategic options for the US and the Member States of the EU in Yemen and the Horn of Africa region are not really open. The fact is that the ruling elites surrounding President Saleh brutally discriminate against and suppress the Shi’ite population in the north of the country and are waging a war against the separatist movement in the south, in the area of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, that is causing a great deal of suffering to the population there. There is no real provable connection to speak of between the Shi’ite population and al-Qaeda and this idea thus merely serves the corrupt and de facto
 autocratic government as a smoke-screen behind which to obtain massive military aid. Supporting this government to build up security forces should be avoided – doing so merely pours further oil on the fire. Any aid provided must benefit all the regions, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political orientation. A reconciliation process including the UN and all local players, including in the neighbouring states – such as Iran – must be initiated and promoted. We must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebels. Operation Atalanta should not be continued and expanded, and absolutely not onto the territory of the Yemeni mainland, because this would only serve the geostrategic interests of Western industrialised nations. We should focus all our efforts on ensuring that the EU does not go along with the US’s completely erroneous strategy of escalation in Yemen, too. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in no other country in the world have there, as yet, been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended. Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children? The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled – atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved. So what is being defended in the Congo? Humanity? Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people? President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms. This change was suspended when the war escalated once again. My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo – the FDLR – reputed to be in Germany? I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– On 9 November 2009, the report on the request for the defence of the immunity and privileges of Tobias Pflüger (A7-0054/2009
) was voted and adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) in the European Parliament. This report is based on incorrect facts. The central point is that the report cites a judgment at first instance which has been repealed. The judgment is invalid, because the regional court in Munich http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=dismiss" ed http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=an" http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=action"  against Tobias Pflüger on 21 July 2009 in the second and final instance. A conviction was not made. For this reason, all reproaches are invalid. It is politically unacceptable that this report, which contains incorrect facts, was voted in Plenary today (24 November 2009). We have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken from the agenda, unfortunately without success. This kind of proceeding by the European Parliament creates the impression of supporting the persecution of politically active persons, in this case, the Munich II Public Prosecution Service against a former Member of the European Parliament.

Madam President, thank you for the report. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I questioned the competent representative of the Commission in a debate on the role of this agreement within the framework of EU immigration management. He clearly stated that, when it entered into force, it would pave the way for cooperation with the border security agency (Frontex) and for numerous immigration regulations, such as within the framework of readmission agreements and border security with Afghanistan. The 1 200 km long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has already been addressed here. It will then also become another target of the EU’s repressive policy to keep out refugees. Thus, the European Union wants to seal itself off from refugees far beyond its external borders. Yet again, we see that this is a fundamental component of EU foreign policy. As a result of such partnership agreements, refugees are interned in camps, in which, as we all know, inhumane conditions prevail, as is currently the case in Ukraine. The problem has already been addressed here in general terms. This form of so-called international immigration management involves serious infringement of the Geneva Refugee Convention and of international human rights. I therefore call on the EU to start fighting the cause of flight rather than the refugees. The European neighbourhood policy is one means of making fortress Europe even more impenetrable, which is why it is looked on very sceptically from our point of view, from the point of view of the GUE/NGL.

 Mr President, I think that this conflict is very often presented in a very one-sided manner. I agree with the previous speaker that in the present case it is frequently a matter of attacks on Han Chinese by Uighurs and indeed that some of these attacks are racially motivated. (Heckling)
 I read an interview with a Uighur woman, for example, who said: Would you like to be governed by yellow communists? The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region, for example they are allowed to have more children, they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples. Many of the local Han Chinese are also envious of them. We ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects. Sometimes problems do not lie where they seem to at first glance. We should be careful not to take a one-sided position. We ought to support the Chinese in solving their problems. The one-sided view that is so often presented in this House is, in my opinion, dangerous. The Chinese Government certainly has shortcomings in its policy towards minority groups and it has its failures too. However, it is also showing the will to improve in many areas. We should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation – and indeed also critical cooperation – based on trust. Sabine Wils,

Mr President, the most recent climate conferences have not produced any substantive improvements. The survival of the small island states and the least developed countries is still at risk from climate change. In Doha, the Green Climate Fund agreed in 2010 must be established, and a decision is also needed on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of 2012.  According to the World Bank, the global South needs USD 100 billion annually from 2014 to support adaptation to the impacts of climate change. It is clear that the industrialised countries must take responsibility for providing this funding. As long as the industrialised and emerging countries are at odds with each other and deploy blockading tactics, Doha will not produce any positive outcomes for the global climate. Climate protection must start at the national level and, in our case, at the European level as well.  The EU must increase its greenhouse reduction target for 2020 to 40 % against the 1990 baseline and make a firm and binding commitment to increase the share of renewables to 45 % by 2030.

Mr President, since it became clear that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy would each be preparing an own-initiative report, Parliament has been overrun by industry lobbyists. A whole string of shale gas events has been held since then here in this House, month after month, by the gas production companies – and with the active support of both conservative and liberal Members. There was only a single event here that was not organised by the disciples of fracking among us. This dominance of one-sided lobbying by financially powerful corporations should give us food for thought. It is unacceptable.  This perversion is particularly apparent when it comes to the subject of fracking. Companies want to protect their income; risks are played down and swept aside. Accidents are ruled out. Apparently we need shale gas for the energy transition. We are told the impact on the landscape will also be minimal, and so on. No, all this cannot hide the fact that fracking involves incalculable risks, is superfluous and only serves the profit interests of a small number of gas monopolists. I therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 4, in which the Member States are called upon not to approve any more fracking activities.

Mr President, I believe these lobbyists are holding this event to influence us MEPs. This event outside Parliament today, before tomorrow’s vote, is particularly blatant. I think that most people will also be unable to escape the arguments being made there, as they are supposedly objective arguments. Nevertheless, I do not wish to imply that of anyone. I find it striking, however, that the industry thinks it can make an impression here with its arguments. Yet certain statements that we are hearing are actually influenced by them. That is why I do not think it a good thing that we are allowed to be overrun by lobbyists in such a way here in Parliament. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Krahmer, to my mind an open debate involves a podium discussion to which both sides are invited, where opponents and advocates of fracking are both given the opportunity to speak. The majority of events that have been held here in Parliament, however, were not of this nature. As I said, just one event against fracking was held, involving a non-governmental organisation from the United States. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)).

Mr President, I do not think an exhibition can influence your opinion, any more than a conversation with a non-governmental organisation can change my opinion.

 Mr President, it is time to put an end once and for all to the fact that, every year, tens of thousands of people in the EU die prematurely because of marine emissions. Outside the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), ships’ engines are more or less burning special waste. On this, the EU is lagging far behind the US and Canada, where only low sulphur fuel can be used in coastal areas. As far as I am concerned, this proposal to amend the directive represents a clear improvement, and this is partly down to the tenacity of the rapporteur. Better limit values are only half the battle, however. Equally as important is the fact that these are then implemented and enforced. There are certain loopholes, as a result of which it cannot be ruled out that shipowners will be able to evade the directive if, for example, a shipowner apparently proves that he is unable to store low sulphur fuels. It really comes down to the Member States and the Commission here. They must implement the regulations and impose painful penalties when necessary. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, in relation to the recast version of the first railway package, all the groups except my own appear to believe that more competition in the railway sector could be beneficial to citizens. In fact, the very opposite is the case. Or is all this perhaps really about securing profits for those private companies involved in the railway sector and bringing about a quick break-up and privatisation of what have, up to now, been national railways such as SNCF and Deutsche Bahn
? Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom, for example, shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy of liberalisation will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. The railway sector should not lose its economic, social and environmental role for the future, and therefore must not be broken up into individual free-market radical, profit-focused parts. My group is therefore on the side of the trade unions and clearly in favour of the idea of retaining integrated railway companies, which have crucial experience and skills, in public hands. These companies not only provide social security for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased volumes of rail traffic in future. In the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the majority from the other groups essentially followed the Commission proposal for a further liberalisation and privatisation of the railway sector. It remains unclear what competences the national rail supervisory authorities and the new EU regulatory body would each have in relation to safety matters. In any case, the safety of rail traffic must be prioritised above the supervision of competition rules. In Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the idea was always in the background that the fourth railway package would also herald the separation of networks and operators. This, too, is something that my group will resolutely oppose. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the fundamental tenor of the Commission’s proposal and of the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in relation to the Energy Taxation Directive would facilitate the uniform handling of all sources of energy by 2023 by following a technically neutral approach with a minimum tax rate for all traded fuels and electricity, based on CO2
 and energy content. At the same time, incentives would be established for the use of less polluting energy products for the transition to a low carbon economy. The proposed directive would provide three important tax incentives: firstly, for the reduction of CO2
 emissions, secondly, for the saving of energy, and thirdly, for the promotion of a changeover to more energy-efficient fuels and more environmentally sound energy production. The adjustment for diesel fuel to bring it into line with the taxation of petrol could place pressure on the motor industry to develop more energy-efficient engines. In the United Kingdom, both fuels are already taxed to the same level. The EU’s objective of minimum taxation establishes equal conditions for all. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the current vote on the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050 is of central importance. The lack of ambition in relation to European climate protection policy threatens the sustainable development of Europe’s economy. Dirty technologies, such as nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, are impeding a change in energy policy. The EU emissions trading system has so far failed as an instrument for climate protection and is undermining European climate protection policy. It shows that market-based instruments are not the way to combat climate change. Long-term climate protection means identifying binding targets for renewable energies and for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Binding interim steps for 2030 and 2040 as part of the move away from the use of carbon in economic activity by 2050 will give industry some certainty in relation to planning. Ambitious climate protection with a long-term goal of 95% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels will promote innovation and create new jobs in the area of renewable technologies.

 Mr President, the Member States and the industrialised nations have been living beyond their means for many years. It is nothing new when I tell you that we can only enjoy a lifestyle like this at the expense of the poorer countries of the world. The WEEE Directive addresses at least part of the problem. The open area of application is of decisive importance. This approach can and should set an example in terms of environmental legislation. I am pleased that a collection target of 85% has been set, particularly because the Council held out stubbornly for lower targets for a long time. I constantly find myself saying: Parliament needs to flex its muscles. After all, people will only invest in environmentally-friendly technologies and innovation will only be encouraged if legislators speed up their work. With this in mind, I also welcome the fact that solar modules are not to be excluded from the directive. It was right not to rely on a voluntary, self-imposed commitment by the manufacturers. All too often in the past, Parliament has bowed to pressure and given in to such deals. These deals have also often proven to be just another way for the industry to drag its heels. Nonetheless, I do not agree with the way the directive deals with nanomaterials. It is essential that waste equipment containing nanomaterials should be dealt with separately. The report simply invites the Commission to investigate whether this is to continue to happen in the future, however. This is an extraordinarily weak formulation that is not worth a great deal. Nanomaterials can be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear indicators stating that they are damaging to health. I am therefore calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. Overall, however, I am satisfied with the results in this context. The perseverance of Parliament in its negotiations with the Council has paid off. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for this. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the obvious point of the new version of the first railway package is to secure profits for private businesses in the rail sector. The integrated public railway companies are to be destroyed by allowing subcontracts to be awarded and marshalling yards and maintenance works to be privatised and operated by private businesses from outside the railway industry. Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. I strongly oppose the suggestion from the Right in Parliament, contrary to the majority opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that the right to strike should be removed by invoking the vital services principle. The railway sector is an integrated network that cannot be divided up into radical free-market, profit-oriented parts. We must not allow this to happen because it must remain possible to control the railway sector in a social, economic and ecological context into the future. It is for this reason that my group sides with the unions and clearly favours the retention of the integrated railway companies in public hands. These companies not only provide social stability for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased transport volumes. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, I am outraged. The stress tests for nuclear power plants in the EU give the operators an alibi to continue running their reactors and are intended to conceal the actual danger represented by the so-called residual risks, in particular, if the power plants do not have to be shut down when the results of the stress tests are negative. The failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures. Radioactive radiation does not stop at national borders. In order to protect the people of Europe and its neighbouring countries, the EU should develop a Europe-wide exit strategy, call on its neighbours to get out of nuclear power as part of its neighbourhood policy and, in this way, prevent new nuclear power stations from being built. The prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the Euratom Treaty, which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry. In the past, loans of more than EUR 500 million have been made available to Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine alone for the construction of new nuclear power stations. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the EHEC epidemic is making apparent the flaws in the system of industrial food production in the liberalised Internal Market of the EU. When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers. So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection. In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders. After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear. If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited. As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food. However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety. Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from. The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic. In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside. The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation. We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy. Our food must be safe. However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks. The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, following the disaster of Chernobyl 25 years ago, new investigations by the Society for Radiation Protection show that to date 1.4 million people have died from the long-term consequences of the nuclear meltdown. Even in Germany we feared for the safety of our children, as they were exposed to radioactive rain clouds and contaminated foodstuffs. The EU must now take the right steps in responding to the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. The fears that the promised stress tests for all nuclear power plants would simply provide an excuse for the continued operation of reactors have unfortunately proven to be well-founded in the light of the stress criteria announced. Other nuclear facilities will not be examined. Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population. We are calling for extensive, binding stress tests carried out by independent experts. However this can only be the first step on the way to a Europe-wide nuclear exit scenario. Sabine Wils

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal waste exports and the illegal disposal of waste pose an increasing threat to the health and environment of millions of people in developing countries. The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU. Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs. I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue. The legal loopholes that permit these hazardous exports must be closed. The existing regulations on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced. We need a legislative proposal for environmental inspections, something that Parliament already called for in 2008, so that ships can be inspected effectively by the authorities in the local ports. This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law. We propose that this should be reinforced in a joint resolution by all sides of the House. The entry of waste into the EU must also be better controlled. Off the coast of Calabria, just a few miles away from the port of Cetraro, there is a sunken vessel known for carrying highly toxic waste. It is assumed that many other toxic waste transporters have been sunk just off the coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea. This example illustrates the need for transparency in the shipment of waste and for reliable official inspections. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, there have recently been demonstrations in Germany in which 250 000 people called for an immediate exit from nuclear power and a changeover to 100% renewable energy. Both of these things are possible. After Chernobyl and Fukushima, it is clear that nuclear power will always involve a residual risk. Therefore, it must be mandatory for the nuclear safety standards throughout Europe to be based on the best available technologies. Despite the adoption of the Council Directive concerning the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009, the existing safety standards remain in place in the Member States. Therefore, we urgently need a revision of this directive with the involvement of Parliament under the codecision procedure which is not based on the Euratom Treaty. I want to see an initiative involving as many of the groups in Parliament as possible which will call on the Council and the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to this effect. I believe that we need a nuclear exit scenario covering the whole of Europe. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown. Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically. This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power. That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price. For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance. Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States. The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty. Billions in taxpayers’ money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL
),

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin discussing light commercial vehicles, I would like to remind you that European car manufacturers have achieved the EU’s CO2
 product targets for cars several years before the deadline in 2015, by taking the appropriate technical measures. It is now clear that the manufacturers were seriously exaggerating during the negotiations on the time period and the targets for the CO2
 reduction measures for cars when these were subsequently watered down. The manufacturers have taken the same approach in their lobbying activities concerning the CO2
 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles. I would like to know how a majority here in Parliament can knowingly repeat this mistake and give in once again to the demands of the automotive industry. In this era of climate change, I believe that the important issues are protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the human race. If Parliament would at least support the Commission’s proposal, this would put the European automotive industry at the cutting edge of technical development and, therefore, allow it to remain competitive. The Commission proposed a reduction target of 135 grams of CO2
 per kilometre. Following a transition period, the manufacturers would not be required to reach this limit until 2020. In my opinion, that would have been feasible. Instead of this, under pressure from the Council, a poor compromise was reached behind closed doors, according to which car manufacturers must now reduce the CO2
 emissions of light commercial vehicles to only 197 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. This feeble compromise is a gift to the industry. Super-credits, phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further. Lobbying by manufacturers among Members of this House and pressure from the vehicle manufacturing countries, namely Germany, France and Italy, in the Council have produced this poor result, which contains a whole series of loopholes. This report is unacceptable. It conflicts with the climate objectives of the EU and will slow down the pace of technical innovation. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will be voting against this report. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically. Millions of tonnes of electric and electronic waste are produced in the EU every year and this represents a genuine hazard for people and the environment. I am pleased that the report by Mr Florenz recognises this problem and that we were able to introduce some pleasing improvements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which had the support of all the groups. The stricter export regulations for electric and electronic waste are important. I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected. However, I still do not agree with the exclusion of solar modules from the directive. I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers. A few manufacturers use cadmium, which is a toxic substance, in their solar modules. The fact that modules are frequently removed by do-it-yourself enthusiasts presents an additional risk. Nanomaterials can also be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear instructions stating that they are damaging to health. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. This is why we have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I would like to ask you to support them. These are Amendments 101 and 102.

 Mr President, the draft directive on patient mobility could quickly lead to healthcare in the EU being reduced to the level of the lowest common denominator, by means of a service-based approach. My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers. The proposed directive will enable health insurance companies to send patients abroad for cheaper treatment. This will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector. If a specific treatment is available more cheaply a few hundred kilometres away, and if patients are sent there by their insurance companies, the result will be that this particular treatment will no longer be available locally. Therefore, the health sector will simply be following the neoliberal logic of the market, instead of giving priority to patients’ welfare. I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to see health tourism in this sensitive sector. I am in favour of patients receiving healthcare close to where they live. This is a public responsibility as part of the provision of services of general interest, which must be available for everyone in their local area. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, grinding, mixing, cheating – these are the three buzzwords of the feed industry in Germany. Since 1999, there have been five dioxin scandals in Germany alone. Feed manufacturers and large food companies are clearly not concerned about EU directives and national legislation when it comes to making large profits with cheap food. Competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in Germany. Feed for intensive livestock farming is therefore intended to be as cheap as possible. State checks are rarely carried out on feed and food producers. The state has increasingly relied on self checking by the manufacturer and saved itself the expense of employing qualified staff. Under these conditions, technical fat waste contaminated with dioxins was able to find its way into the feed and foodstuffs chain. The current dioxin scandal could have been prevented if the fat had been tested for dioxins before it was mixed into the feed. The contamination would then have been detected in time. Numerous consumers have now been contaminated with additional dioxins once again. Eighty percent of our intake of dioxins enters our bodies via foodstuffs of animal origin – in other words, meat, milk and eggs. Foodwatch is rightly demanding that feed manufacturers be placed under obligation to test every batch of feed ingredients for dioxins and PCBs before they mix the feed. Absolutely no ingredients that do not comply with the limit values may be included in the feed. Highly contaminated batches must be destroyed, and it must be possible to prove that this has indeed been done. That is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminants. Laboratories must also be placed under obligation to report cases where the limit values are exceeded to the national supervisory authorities. We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability. The current and previous food scandals in Germany have shown that routine state checks on the feed manufacturers and animal producers are essential. How do you intend to implement that Commissioner?

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the climate conference in Cancún must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation. As part of an alliance of responsibility, the EU must demonstrate political leadership, regardless of what the United States does, and allow itself to be judged by the principle of climate justice. This means that there must be a second commitment period for the industrialised nations under the Kyoto Protocol. Additional funds must be provided for financing climate measures. With regard to long-term financing, the EU must lay its cards on the table in the negotiations. The EU must present ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases. The global temperature must under no circumstances increase by more than 1.5°C. This target will result in technical innovations and create jobs at a time of economic crisis. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a good job and salvaged what was possible in the face of great resistance from the Council and the majority here in Parliament. One major success of the new version is the open scope. This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it. On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC. Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force. Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs. We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly. Leading manufacturers are showing us the way. Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times. It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result. After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them. The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, biocides form part of many cleaning products, disinfectants, insect sprays and other everyday products which people come into contact with in the course of their daily lives. There are currently more than 50 000 biocide products in the European Union. I would like to make it perfectly clear to everyone that biocides are mainly used by private citizens. Biocides are often non-biodegradable, in some cases, carcinogenic, highly toxic substances, and can cause harm to people, animals and the environment when they are being used and disposed of. People and young children in particular are especially at risk when biocides are used in the home, for example, in the form of wood preservatives and insect sprays. It is true that the manufacturers say that their products are not hazardous if they are used properly. However, given that 400 000 tonnes of biocides are sold to and used by private individuals in the EU every year, it is important that improper use and the occurrence of accidents are taken into consideration. As this has not yet been the case, I have tabled an amendment on this subject and I would ask you vote in favour of it. This is Amendment 352. Should the purpose of this regulation be to increase the free circulation of biocidal products within the European Union as the Commission has proposed? Or is this House more concerned with protecting people and the environment? It is essential that we introduce a strict ban on particularly hazardous substances. We must make a decision which supports the cause of consumers, otherwise we will be putting people’s health at risk. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, two phases of postal service liberalisation have already been implemented. The Commission has not, as yet, published a single study dealing solely with social conditions and the impact on postal workers of the opening up of the market. My question to you, Commissioner Barnier, is when will this study be made available to Parliament at long last? Yesterday, we heard from numerous postal workers from several EU Member States that entire workforces are already being dismissed by the new postal companies and re-employed under poorer conditions. Competition and competition policy must not be played out at the expense of the workers. If the Commission and Parliament really want to do something to combat poverty and exclusion in the EU, the third phase of the postal service liberalisation must now be discontinued. The consequences for postal workers and the quality of the universal service must first be investigated. We therefore call for a moratorium on the third phase of postal service liberalisation for the sake of customers and postal workers. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Unfortunately, the joint resolution’s recitals contain a positive reference to the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which I and my group reject. But due to the very high importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries I and the GUE/NGL group signed the joint resolution on the entry into force of the CCM and the role of the EU, as this joint resolution must be seen as a great success in order to ban cluster munitions.

– I welcome the motion for a resolution on the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Kampala, Uganda, as it contains very crucial and important points and requests regarding the ratification and the implementation of the ICC. Therefore, I voted in favour. But I want to express my deep concerns about certain phrases in the resolution, which refer positively to the ‘Stockholm Programme’, the ‘EIDHR’ and to the European Union as a ‘Global Player’. In this matter, the ‘Stockholm Programme’ and the ‘EIDHR’ might have had a positive impact, but in many other areas, these two programmes/instruments are not used in a democratic and transparent manner. The European Union has indeed been acting as a ‘Global Player’ but, in my view, not at all in a positive way towards a more fair and solidary world order. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the United Nations climate conference failed due to the hard-nosed political interests of the industrialised nations. As a result, the basis for existence of billions of people in developing countries and in the island nations at risk of being submerged is in jeopardy. There is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet. The EU played the game in the interests of its national undertakings and the profits of the large concerns. The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States by a total of 30% by 2020 was not brought to the table early enough. Making better climate protection targets dependent on the prior concessions of other States is playing dice with the future of humanity. The facts are clear: in 2007, CO2
 emissions per person were 4.6 tonnes in China, in Germany they were 9.7 tonnes and in the US 19.1 tonnes. We urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity. Next year in Mexico City, the industrialised nations and emerging economies must come to a binding agreement with specific and ambitious targets. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in many parts of the world the consequences of climate change are visible. The most recent calculations assume a global temperature rise of up to 4° C by 2060, and up to 10° C in the Arctic. It is primarily Europe’s soot emissions that are responsible for the significantly faster melting of the ice in the Arctic – they are borne there by the wind. The rich industrial States of the EU are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change. USD 100 billion will be needed every year from 2010 to 2050. Of that amount, it is fair to say that USD 30 billion is not too much for the European Union. The transfer of technology must also not be linked to patents, or else some of the money will simply be flowing straight back to the corporations in the industrialised countries. The EU has an obligation to take a lead at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy. When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care. How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half? How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester? I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs. On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece. I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what should worry us and make us panic is not simply the sheer numbers of unemployed young people in Europe, but the way this is developing. Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation. It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living. If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities. I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity. When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis. In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe’s economy. We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies. That would be the right approach. Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people. I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70. We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market. That is what I am urgently calling for. Thomas Händel,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speculation was a major factor in triggering the crisis, while credit default swaps (CDSs) and short selling have been a major factor in heightening the crisis. These instruments have degenerated into purely speculative instruments. Some people in the financial sector seem to have incorrectly regarded or misused these instruments as a personal licence to print money. As a result, entire economies have suffered, along with nation states and, above all, the people of the countries concerned. To this extent, the fact that the Commission has finally taken the initiative and realised that regulation is necessary is to be welcomed. Whether or not the regulation will be strict remains to be seen. I expressly welcome the work and the efforts by the rapporteur, Mr Canfin, to improve the regulation tabled and to put a stop to the gambling. What is needed is a de facto
 ban on naked short selling and the prevention of speculation in the future. We also need strict regulation and, above all, a strong supervisory authority in Europe. I fear, however, that as the negotiations continue, the interests of the financial centres – London and Frankfurt in particular – will override the interests of the majority of the people of Europe. If that happens we will be left with little more than a Swiss cheese in which the holes are probably larger than what is left. That is quite definitely not something my group could support.

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint. It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do. On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation. Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households. This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers. Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission. The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers. For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support. I would like to comment on four points. Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention. If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place. Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area. Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights. Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector. I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions. This is a good thing. We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, public procurement law and the awarding of public contracts are an essential part of the internal market. Mr Barnier, my response to your remarks about wanting to promote social integration in this context is that I have heard very little about protecting social rights or about protecting collective agreements. These are some of the fundamental rules which you, as you have said, do not want to call into question. If we want to protect the fundamental rules, we must ensure in future, during the process of awarding public contracts, that basic social standards are maintained, that collective agreements are not undermined, and that the use of cheap labour is prevented. All of this forms part of modern public procurement law. I would like to make it clear that we must no longer put greater emphasis on economic freedoms and free competition than on fundamental social rights. Either we want a social Europe or we want permanent conflict with the people who are turning away from Europe because it does not protect their interests. Thomas Händel,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too. Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity. I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prosperity of a country is created through the work of its people. In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid. People want proper, secure pensions in their old age. One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable. In contrast, occupational and private pension funds have lost millions of euro on the stock exchange. It is ridiculous to increase the focus on private, capital-based pension systems when providing for people’s retirement. The public has financed the rescue packages for the major banks. The people are paying for a tough austerity policy which is under the control of the European Union. Now, they are supposed to turn around national budgets by taking cuts in their pensions and accepting a higher retirement age. Previous pension reforms are already leading to increasing poverty in old age. The only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension systems. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition. However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider. In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition. The report sets down pointers for the Commission’s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe. Thomas Händel,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs. That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family. The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain. Women, in particular, have been affected by this. The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women. Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions. Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation. Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘good work’ principles. All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers. The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented. Thomas Händel,

We do not deny the fact that improvements have been made with regard to the equality of men and women, but it would have been better to integrate a separate guideline into this set of guidelines. We will request this very forcefully in plenary tomorrow. Secondly, it is important that the evaluation of the results and the reporting obligations are firmly established within Parliament’s sphere of competence and that there are now more exacting objectives and sub-goals with regard to labour market participation and active labour market policy in the report. However, it would be important for Parliament to confirm tomorrow that the ILO principles relating to good and decent work as well as the question of a minimum income that is clearly above the poverty line are taken into consideration in the report. I am, however, of the opinion that this report still has a number of shortcomings. It is far too reminiscent of the old Lisbon strategy. The failed flexicurity principles have been repeated like a mantra and much of the wording smacks of the old deregulation policy. Secondly, if principles such as the compatibility of work and family life, social cohesion, sustainable economic management, investments and education are mentioned but there are no specific measures to follow this, it represents a weakness in the report. For more and better employment, it would be necessary to place the focus on reducing the precariousness of the current situation and to emphasise the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same place’, to make the model of full-time employment the central focus once again, to limit the maximum working week and consider reducing working hours and, above all, with regard to cohesion, to incorporate social progress as a mandatory element and not permit any backward steps.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the responsibility in this European Parliament to regulate the financial markets firmly. All the proposals we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues. The Council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights. Mr Giegold is right when he described what is currently going on as ‘parochial’. The intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations, but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down. We will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets. Inadequate conclusions are being drawn from this financial and economic crisis, which means that the next crisis is already brewing. Many national economies, including those in Europe, will not withstand the blows to come, with all the social and economic repercussions this entails for people living in Europe. They are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored. If the CEO of UniCredit Bank, Alessandro Profumo, says as he did at the weekend that we need a strong, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority and a common set of rules for all Member States, calling for tighter capital rules, this is an appeal to this Parliament to actually draw up these rules. It is this European Parliament’s job to exert pressure on the Council and enforce effective regulation as a matter of urgency. This would be just the first step to a status quo ante
. It is finally time for the grandiose promises to be backed up by actions. My group supports strong European regulation. Any other situation, without regulations, would pose a danger to the euro, a single EU and democracy. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months. I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths? What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work. As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘Let’s see what happens’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious. My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence. Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House! Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model. It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority. I therefore call on Europe’s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures. That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty. Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe’s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports. However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it. Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation. What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme – at best, it is a nanofinance programme! Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out. Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable. Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme. Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect. Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way. In this form, we will reject this programme. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share much of what the Commission has put forward here on the causes and the prospects for the car industry – overcapacities, the need to change strategy, new technologies. However, I would like to point out that there are a number of things that we do not share. Opel will probably not be the last case in the car industry, where there is 30% overcapacity across the globe. We are not only talking about the approximately 12 million people who directly or indirectly live off this industry but the roughly 30 million people throughout Europe who are involved in this industry’s economic output. In this situation, the Commission shares responsibility for ensuring that the European car industry is able to master this challenge. The Commission also shares responsibility for ensuring that Opel does not now become the sacrificial pawn of a free-market clean-up of the crisis. The necessary re-alignment of the management of free market forces in this Union will not automatically balance the anticipated job losses with new jobs. On the contrary, indeed, those in jobs and European national economies will pay the price. The general prevention of State aid will lead to the advent not only of distortions of competition but also social distortions. These will then take a much bigger toll on the coffers of the affected countries than they can afford and, above all, much more than those coffers would be burdened by the aid currently being offered, when you include the dismantlement of social services. The restructuring of the European car industry needs strong initiatives from the Commission, but also from the relevant national governments. We therefore propose a European industry council on the future of mobility involving politicians, businesses, trade unions and academics. It would have to develop possible courses of action for the necessary technical changes and define political measures and the associated funding. Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens. That applied years ago to the steel industry, and it must now apply to Opel and to the car industry in Europe as a whole. State aid can and, in my view, must also be linked to achieving an institutionalised employee participation with extended rights of codecision. All affected employees in Europe need security for their sites, they need new work and new, secure future prospects across Europe.Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament’s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live. In my view, the Council’s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament. Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive. We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored. We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights. The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council. I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last! Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, this is a never-ending story. I have lost count of the times we have discussed it here. It is a shameful situation that it takes an oral question today to elicit information from the Commission about what it plans to do next with regard to data retention. Let me be frank: instead of deluding itself, the Commission should stop playing games and should face up to reality. That includes admitting that data retention has failed.  The Commission’s aim of establishing uniform rules is quite simply misguided. One reason is that some Member States, due to their constitutional arrangements, are not in a position to transpose the European Directive. What’s more, we have a patchwork of arrangements in the other countries which have transposed the Directive. Some countries store data for six months, others for a year. Some only use the data when investigating serious crime; others use the data to investigate minor delictions. It is a terrible mess, and I do not think we have ever seen anything like it. Now you are taking action against the German Government by referring the matter to the European Court of Justice. Curiously, you argue that Germany’s failure to transpose the Directive is likely to have a negative effect on the internal market and on the ability of the German police to investigate and prosecute serious crime. What did you get that from? How did you come up with that? No one can possibly know whether that claim is true. In fact, studies have revealed a very different picture. The available information includes not only the judgments of the courts and related studies. They also include activity reports such as those produced by the German Bundestag’s Research Services, which is genuinely above suspicion. In 2011, the Research Services found no significant evidence that data retention offers any benefits for the investigation of crime. The reports such as that produced by the Max Planck Institute in 2012 are also beyond reproach. That report states that data retention is of no use whatsoever in the investigation of murders, robberies, child pornography and internet crime. Let me say this, Ms Malmström. If the Commission has nothing new to contribute here, you should at least suspend the Directive pending the judgment of the European Court of Justice. Aside from that, we are calling for a Europe-wide ban on the retention of communications data where there is no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

Mr President, Mr Voss, data retention does not solve any problems. In fact, it is the problem. Let me offer an analogy. Not long ago, I was walking through my home city of Dresden and happened to spot a burglar breaking into a house. Let me ask you this: would you now act on this information by passing a directive which states that women in my age group should stroll through Europe’s cities at night in order to reduce the crime rate? I think we should be asking about the benefits of the Directive. We are nearing the end of this debate and I have just one point to make. Instead of flogging a dead horse – to use your analogy – and filching millions of people’s data, I would suggest that we proceed as follows. Ms Malmström, perhaps you could offer different advice to the Interior Ministers of the EU Member States. You could tell them not to make cuts in the police or law enforcement agencies in their countries. You could tell them to provide decent training for the police and the judiciary and to tackle corruption, which is now widespread. If we manage to achieve that in our countries, we would be making a valuable contribution to combating crime, which would greatly benefit citizens. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, we really ought to speak plainly and clearly today, and this plain-speaking includes the fact that we cannot turn the clock back, and nor do we want to. As Parliament, we have the right under the Treaty to be involved in decisions on all matters relating to Schengen and not just to be casually consulted. That is something that I would like to make clear at the start. I would also like to say that this EU law simply must not be left to the arbitrariness of political freebooters – and that is how I would describe it. Politically motivated contravention – and that is also the term I would choose to use – using the Schengen agreement as a kind of muscle-flexing in election campaigns, is totally unacceptable, and also has nothing to do with EU law. These problems do not only include arbitrary border closures, which we had for a time and which, of course, violate EU law, they also include the installation of cameras at 15 border crossings between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium. If these do not also constitute border controls, then what are they? Furthermore, all that nonsense from a German interior minister concerning the reintroduction of border controls is obviously dangerous. It is dangerous not just because of the problems with Schengen, but also because it represents the arguments of the extreme right, and not just in Germany. Equally unacceptable is the fact that, at the border between Germany and the Czech Republic, which is, incidentally, where I live, buses are constantly being checked. We must not tolerate this. It is not only buses from the Czech Republic that are being checked, but people who look a bit different in some way, for example those who have slightly darker skin, are also being checked. This is also part of the problem. Let us make it very clear that this is not acceptable. We do not want this, because it contravenes the law and because, as Parliament, we do not want this sort of policy. We therefore also express our criticism of the Council’s action in the strongest possible terms. After all, this is not merely a contravention of the law; it is also undemocratic. I therefore suggest that the Council discusses four things with us: Firstly, we ought to be in agreement that there must be no arbitrariness in the way that the Schengen Agreement is implemented. That is something I would like to discuss. Secondly, we want to increase free movement. We want to talk about this. Thirdly, in the event of contraventions of the Schengen Agreement, we want the Commission, with the involvement of the Council, to draw the necessary conclusions. Lastly, as Parliament, we want to be fully involved in all matters, and that includes decision making. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is clear that this is not about individual facts which we have to discuss but about the fundamental issue of our attitude to democracy and civil liberties. When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do. These are the reasons why millions of people have taken to the streets and have long since anticipated the vote on ACTA. There has already been a vote on ACTA on the streets, on the Internet and in relation to the Committee on Petitions in many countries, not only inside but also outside the EU. I believe that we must not ignore this vote. It is a demonstration of direct democracy by the many citizens who elected us. I can only say that we should put ACTA to one side. That is the only decent thing to do. Cornelia Ernst,

 Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, the EU’s open borders represent the most important symbol of the Union around the world, and they have a deep allure to many people across the globe. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as you know, have always criticised the fact that the EU is also associated with fencing off the outside at the same time. That is precisely the reason why it was so important to us to retain a built-in European emergency mechanism, but the Council was up in arms about that idea. I can only say to you that what you are doing here, what you, the Council, are celebrating, is troglodytic. Go back to the basic principles of the Community! I beg you to do that! Put an end to this kind of, ultimately, anti-European politics. Ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Council in this case is anti-democratic, as it seeks to downgrade Parliament to the status of a consulted body. We will not tolerate this, however. We have it in writing, we have a Treaty right to codecision, and we intend to – and will – exercise that right. My second point is that the Council’s decision is deeply anti-European because it nationalises Schengen. I ask you, the Council, the Danish Presidency: do you want to bring back the customs borders? Do you want to go back to the 19th century? What signs are you hoping to send to the outside world with this decision? You are making yourselves look ridiculous to the world, and to Europe. My third point is that this decision by the Council is populist, in the truest sense of the word, and provides a boost to the forces of nationalism, exactly those people who want to retreat to the nations and destroy the Europe that we have built. We cannot settle for that. I appeal to you to take back your decision, and be Europeans again! Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I believe that we are faced with a very sensitive issue when we come to talk about residence restrictions, particularly because this gives a push to right-wing populist and extremist forces. When we see the populist right-wing Swiss People’s Party successfully campaigning for a referendum on the issue of quotas for non-nationals, then we find ourselves on the horns of a dilemma. There is something that I want to state clearly on behalf of our group: neither EU citizens nor anyone else should be allowed to become political footballs or the object of cheap right-wing propaganda as a result of so-called mass immigration, in this case involving Switzerland. The problem is particularly difficult because it relates to European citizens. If we look at who obtains the largest number of residence permits, we find that over two-thirds are EU citizens. In April 2012, the Swiss authorities, in a hasty response, decided to introduce quotas for certain countries. If we take a closer look, we can see a contradiction here: if we consider the breakdown for residence permits as a whole, then we find that most are granted to Germans and Italians, not Czechs or Poles. The proportion of nationals from the eight countries in question is really relatively small and yet the 10 % rule is being invoked, something quite ridiculous in comparison with citizens of other countries. This again shows what happens when one deals with such questions in terms of percentages. You soon find yourself falling into a huge trap, as I would remind you. It is politically dubious and counterproductive for Switzerland to invoke the agreement with the EU, referring to Article 10(4). We see this as a violation of the directive on the freedom of movement and the agreement with Switzerland and, above all, we consider it as discrimination against specific citizens and Member States. That must not be allowed to happen. We need equal treatment for all EU citizens, including in relation to Switzerland. We must be absolutely clear about this. For this reason, we refuse on principle to discuss quotas here, as they actually fan the flames of xenophobia. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, firstly, either there are uniform EU visa rules and a binding reciprocity mechanism for all Member States, in which case the Commission – as Guardian of the Treaties – must fight hard for these to be implemented, or there are not, in which case the Commission has already been tolerating a two-tier system for EU citizens for many years, and my group considers that absolutely unacceptable. We demand that the Commission resolves this problem without delay and prior to concluding the agreement with Canada. Otherwise, the reciprocity mechanism must apply. That is my first point. At the same time, however, we have to take ourselves seriously, which leads me to ask whether the new visa regulation will at least strengthen the reciprocity mechanism? Is that the case? Can we in fact prevent such practices as have occurred in relation to Canada from occurring again in future? The only thing I can say to that is: by no means. What has emerged, however, is that visa policy continues to be used as a means of exerting pressure against migration. As my third point, can we please talk for once about the population group that is often meant when we talk about the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. It is the Roma. Many Roma have gone to Canada, and the Czech Republic argues that Canada is itself to blame for this because Canada has for years created incentives for high levels of immigration through its generous and tolerant asylum policy. That is Canada’s argument, and they are doing nothing to counter this. On the contrary, they go so far as to support it by saying: well, how is it that EU citizens are even able to go to third countries and claim asylum? Indeed, why is that? It is because the Roma have miserable living conditions in the EU – a situation of which we have been aware for many years, in which they are so discriminated against and excluded that it is no wonder that people are going to countries such as Canada. To me, this issue is also a kind of Lex Roma
; and to that extent, if we really want to do something about it, if we want to prevent emigration, then we have to improve conditions at home. That is what we should be looking at. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left intends voting against this agreement because it nullifies an elementary right of EU citizens, namely the right to the protection of personal data. Ms Malmström, I can only shake my head in despair at what you have had to say. You seem to be chasing an imaginary level of security that does not exist and that will not come into existence with this agreement or any other agreement of this kind. We are not talking about a small amount of travel information about European citizens, but rather about the combination of this information with other long-established databases, enabling profiling and thus the monitoring of individual citizens. We reject this agreement because no adequate evidence has been provided – not even by you, Ms Malmström – of the possible benefits of this agreement. We also oppose it because proportionality and purpose limitation are taken to absurd lengths when millions of data records belonging to innocent citizens are retained. We reject it because the use of this data goes far beyond the purpose you have indicated – the fight against terrorism and the combating of serious, organised, cross-border crime. Article 4 contains an escape clause that also needs to be discussed. This clause significantly widens the purpose for which data can be used. We cannot support this agreement because it involves the processing and forwarding of the PNR data to an authority, the Department of Homeland Security, where the intelligence services hold power, and even to third countries; none of this can be controlled by Parliament, so that there is no guarantee of transparency. We reject the agreement because the period for which the data is to be retained goes against all understanding of proportionality and appropriateness, whereby even sensitive data can be retained for 30 days and possibly even longer. This is scandalous. It is quite impossible for our group to vote in favour because there is no serious provision for judicial remedy. The judicial remedy provisions contained in the agreement are laughable. All that is offered is a limited right to information and it is not even possible to take legal recourse according to a proper data protection law. This is just not possible. Judicial remedy is transformed into the obstruction of justice. To Mr Voss and the other Members who intend voting in favour of this agreement I would say: if our own EU Treaties mean anything to us, then we must reject this agreement. It is all a question of responsibility, Mr Voss, namely responsibility to the citizens of the European Union. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, our group supported the call at the time of the last amendment to the Biometric Passports Regulation in 2009 for a review to be carried out in three years’ time and for four studies to be presented. One of the reasons that our group supported this was because it has expressed major concerns time and again on the grounds of data protection and also on account of the overestimation of the benefit of using biometric data in passports. The belief in the perfect form of identification, the overestimation of this method too, and – associated with this – the overestimation of other parts of the security chain are genuinely problematic. The use of biometric data is still subject to this major misconception, namely the assumption that these data are unchangeable and mostly reliable. That is absolutely not the case. These data are also subject to change throughout a person’s life. They differ between childhood and old age. We therefore need reliable and sound studies and conclusions. People are still busily forging these documents. We have now been able to establish this. As the incidents in the United Kingdom and other countries repeatedly demonstrate, the chips are definitely not safe from misuse. They are readily cracked and, for those concerned, this can result in permanent damage. The standards within the EU also differ widely. The error rate – as seen in France and the Netherlands – is very high. We need to ask ourselves again and again what benefit we get from biometric data if documents are falsified and enter into circulation. Thus, if one part of the chain is falsified and the ‘breeder’ documents are at variance, biometric data would no longer be of any help to us. The Chaos Computer Club in Germany needed a few minutes only to demonstrate the falsification of a chip. For this, the people of the Chaos Computer Club needed the cap of a plastic bottle, some superglue, a digital camera and a little wood glue, and in a few minutes they had cracked the chip. So much for supposed security. We are waiting for the Commission to present the studies and, of course, also the results and the lessons that can be drawn from them. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, has anyone in this Parliament actually ever written a report about the number of men in middle and top positions who are mediocre, low-achievers? Had there been such a report, it would have observed – as we already know from our real lives – that a great number of men who really are not effective and not particularly brilliant nevertheless occupy top positions. We would also have hit upon the idea that perhaps the factor of excellence in performance, which is supposed to be the sole criterion for top positions, is not, in fact, the only factor. There is a glass ceiling for women, also known as structural discrimination, and as long as that is the case, we will need this quota. It is very crude tool: all the quota does is to create formal equality, which is the prerequisite for bringing about real equality of rights and fairness between the sexes. It seems to me that we should not beat around the bush, we should give this our clear support and I am therefore nailing my colours to the mast in support of this quota. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am still somewhat astonished. After years of Mr Barroso and his colleagues in the Council having pursued a policy of austerity, and successfully having forced upon everyone unemployment and cuts in social security spending under the umbrella of the crisis, they have now discovered the unemployed. As important as this subject certainly is, it sounds like mockery if you see the promotional film for it on EuroparlTV, which talks about additional funding. I have a simple question for you, Mr Hahn, namely, where in your petty cash can you find EUR 82 billion? We all know that everything is actually already planned up to 2013 – and we are not far from the point where that door will be closing. We should not be dealing in tricks, nor should we be talking as if everyone could now receive the same funding or indeed adequate funding. Quite specifically, what is the situation with Ireland, for example, which, as we all know, has already spent all of its resources? What advice do you have for the Irish Government when it comes to combating youth unemployment? It is self-evident that we need to make major efforts in employment policy in order to reduce youth unemployment. That much is clear, but we also need real money to be able to do so. We also need to get behind it. Furthermore, there are, of course, other things that we need, such as more sensible protection against dismissal, or truly decent work. Finally, I would just like to reiterate what it is that we do not need, namely macro-economic conditionality over the forthcoming subsidy period. That is something that we should not even look into. We are observing at this point in time what that means. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent sanctions by the EU are not confidence-building measures, but sabre rattling. That is a fact. Attempting to get Iran to compromise by exerting more pressure is politically naive and also irresponsible. As the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, we do not want any nuclear programmes, that is clear, including in Iran. We strongly condemn the Iranian regime on account of its horrendous human rights violations, oppression of religious minorities and persecution of human rights activists, but stopping Iranian oil as a result of the de facto trade ban with Iran’s Central Bank will ultimately hit ordinary citizens. That is a fact. It will also help the Iranian regime’s election campaign ahead of the elections in March this year and will increase the risk of war throughout the region. That, Baroness Ashton, is the scale of what we are talking about here. There is as yet no genuine proof that Iran has a current nuclear weapons programme. There are indications up to 2003, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has provided no evidence for the period thereafter in its report. It has assumptions and the claims of the secret services. Instead of an escalation, we need a human rights dialogue and serious negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Middle East and peaceful coexistence throughout the region. That is what the EU should be doing instead of making the current situation worse. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I would like to make the following point. We are not talking about the economic situation in Hungary. We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries. It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants. Instead, I would like to see Article 7 applied, because this situation involves a clear risk of a serious breach of the fundamental values of the EU. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the combined work and residence permit for third-country nationals in the EU came in like a lion and is going out like a lamb, to coin a phrase. This in no way opens the way for a truly simplified regulation for third-country nationals who would like to work in the EU. That remains the case even if residence is increasingly being linked with work. In many cases that may be all well and good – but it is the only focus here, and we see that as a problem. Furthermore, we do not feel that this directive is a step in the right direction. Firstly, this is because its scope is too narrow. Its provisions are narrow-minded and provincial. It is not just that it is only to be applicable to the executing Member State and not to the EU as a whole; that does not even get mentioned any more. It is also that the regulation is not to apply to family members of Union citizens if they are third-country nationals, nor to seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees or people under international or temporary protection. This gives rise to all kinds of individual directives, and as a result there are different classes of third-country nationals with differing rights. My second point is that there is no real simplification or legal harmonisation, and this is true through the mere fact that the Member States actually have the final say on all matters – such as whether it is the employer or the employee who is to apply for the permit. If it is the employer, the potential employee may not even get to see the application, such as in cases where it is rejected. He will have absolutely no opportunity to comment legally in any form whatsoever. We are also critical of the fact that an application may be deemed inadmissible if the Member State sets quotas for the labour market. The third point I would like to make – and I will concede this to the rapporteur – is that it is good that pension entitlements will be recognised. It is absolutely unacceptable, however, that there is not completely equal treatment with employees who are EU nationals. There are to be considerable restrictions – and these will depend on the class of person – when it comes to vocational training, social benefits – such as for family members – and access to public housing. That is really not acceptable. If that is made a fundamental principle, then it is a mistake and we cannot support it. That is why we are rejecting this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, a few hours ago, an important prize was awarded here in this Chamber. It was said that freedom, justice and solidarity are pillars of the European Union. However, I would like to ask you: how can that be reconciled with the fact that racist violence against the Roma is to a certain degree the order of the day in very many Member States and is a constant state of affairs in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and the Balkans? It is also the case that Roma, who are EU citizens, are being expelled not only from France, but also from Denmark, Italy, Germany and Finland. However, freedom, solidarity and justice, of which we speak so often here, should apply universally or not at all. It is scandalous – I cannot put it any better – if, despite an EU framework strategy, despite numerous promises by the Member States, the largest minority in Europe continues to be discriminated against. In the Czech Republic, I spoke with Roma families that were utterly shocked and, above all, frightened because anti-Roma demonstrations had been taking place for months right outside their front door – and with banners containing the words: ‘gas the Roma’! That is shocking, not just as a neighbour of these Roma, but it also not worthy of our history when we simply tolerate such a thing or attempt to change it with the use a few more police officers. In the Czech Republic, as in many other countries, Roma children still attend separate schools – and in the Czech Republic, for example, they go to schools with disabled children. As a left-leaning politician, I say to you that the Roma do not belong in separate schools, and neither do disabled children. That violates human rights and I believe that that needs to be said in this regard. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that separate schools for Roma are illegal. Despite this, these schools merrily continue. As we all know, the European Roma Rights Centre has examined 44 cases in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and found that violent attacks on Roma were utterly inadequately prosecuted and that no convictions were brought at all. Many law enforcement agencies are totally blind when it comes to the Roma. Moreover, the Czech Senate unabashedly confirmed recently that it will not participate in a Roma strategy. That is apartheid in action at the heart of Europe. We have to do something about this. There will also be a price to pay for the fact that the Roma framework strategy does not lay down any binding requirements and that the subject of anti-racism does not form part of this strategy. I can say to you quite honestly that enough is enough.; I would ask the Commission how long it intends to continue to sit back and watch. Where is the consistency in its actions when it comes, for example, to framework decisions for combating racism and the Anti-discrimination Directive being implemented – properly implemented – in the Member States? Article 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for the possibility of action being taken against Member States that have seriously breached the values of the EU. I therefore call on you most urgently to make use of this provision. After all, we must defend the rights and freedoms of the Roma as European citizens. Who will do that if we do not?

Mr President, I have a question for Mr Hahn concerning the delegated acts. These acts play an important role in cohesion policy and it is also clear to me that delegated acts are necessary for the implementation of a number of issues. Parliament and the Council also have a withdrawal option, which is a good thing. However, I believe that the situation has got rather out of hand and that these acts are being used in the case of questions which we in Parliament should be deciding on together with the Council. One example is the common strategic framework, Articles 10 and 11 of the general regulation, which lays down goals for subsidies from the Cohesion Fund, important challenges in the territorial area and actions to be taken centrally. My question is: why have you chosen the delegated act in the case of such an important document, for example, and not the ordinary legislative procedure? In this context, perhaps you can make some general remarks about the problems of delegated acts. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Hahn, you have already made some remarks on macro-economic conditionality. You have said that it will probably not be used at all, or at least only in an emergency or a similar situation. However, I would like to ask you nevertheless: is there a built-in safeguard and is it possible to prevent particularly disadvantaged regions, which would not receive money if a conditionality of this kind were to take effect, being put at a further disadvantage?

 Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a broader scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is taking a clear stance against this agreement, and will vote accordingly, in the clear knowledge that there are some aspects of the agreement that might seem acceptable according to the principle of ‘a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Of course we have understood this, thanks to Ms in ’t Veld. The counter-arguments are more convincing, however. We still have no proof of the need to record PNR data. The mass of data, or so-called waste data, actually makes it harder to find potential criminals. Despite everything, what we have here is a willy-nilly approach to data retention, even when no suspicion exists, and this, as my colleague has pointed out, is prohibited, not just in Germany but in several other Member States too. We wish to register genuinely serious concerns that this agreement cannot be reconciled with EU law. That is why we requested a corresponding legal opinion, which we are also presenting for the purposes of the discussion and vote. Even though it is, of course, better to a certain extent to have some sort of retention period rather than none at all, I would ask you seriously why it is necessary to store data for five-and-a-half years. This makes profiling realistic and feasible, particularly since it is not completely and definitively excluded by this agreement. A word about the scope of the agreement: the Commissioner referred to the fact that serious cross-border crime does not exist as a criminal offence in Australia. It simply does not exist. Instead of a minimum mandatory sentence of four years, we would have been better served with a list of specific criminal offences. Otherwise, our main concern is that this agreement will be used as the template for negotiations with the US, but not because the agreement is so bad, but rather because at least in Australia the data is processed by the customs authorities when it arrives there, while in the US, the responsible authority is the unknown quantity that is the Department of Homeland Security. This agreement turns innocent people into objects of suspicion on a wholesale basis and undermines elementary freedoms. My group wants nothing to do with this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, body scanners are placebos. If you look it up in Wikipedia, a placebo is a sham medicine that contains no active ingredient and thus has no pharmacological effect. The fact is that a ten-month test phase in Germany, for example, showed that body scanners resulted in a lower level of security than conventional methods and were therefore a failure. Sweat stains were signalled as a security risk, tissues as a danger. There were false alarm levels of up to 100%. No body scanner in the world can analyse body orifices or inside the body. Objects hidden there cannot be detected. We should not suppose that terrorists are more stupid than they are. Where body scanners were used regularly, it was not the success rate that went up, but rather the abuse rate. Take a look at the US: a woman there had to remove her breast prosthesis to prove what it was, and that was after scanning. In the UK, two women refused to be scanned for religious or health reasons and were not permitted to fly. The most embarrassing body checks exist as alternatives in various countries. The risk of abuse is likely to rise further in the future simply because the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided, as stated previously, that real body images are possible. That means being able to see the actual outlines. There have already been cases of offensive remarks having increased and that is a human rights problem. The word placebo comes from the Latin and means ‘I will please’. The only ones this will please are the market leaders in body scanners that make and sell this rubbish. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, Mr Tavares, do you know of any examples that would actually justify the expense of spending many millions – billions in fact – on developing these body scanners? Are there examples showing that they have resulted in an increase in security? Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there can scarcely be another institution established by the European Union that is so controversial when it comes to human rights as Frontex is. This agency is associated with shameful images on the high seas where thousands of people have lost their lives, of land borders where people are kept in custody and where deep trenches are now being dug. At heart, Frontex embodies an erring policy towards refugees in Europe, refugees who leave their homelands not only as a result of political persecution, but also for economic reasons – simply to survive – as a result of hunger, civil wars and climate disasters. The new Frontex mandate does incorporate real and substantial improvements – and for that I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil – such as the obligation to respect human dignity, the right of non-refoulement, non-discrimination, the prohibition of torture, the respect of refugee minors, and the guaranteeing of data protection. Rescues at sea are now finally to be given stability and there is to be a code of conduct for border officials – but it is also true that the mandate does not lay down a principle of refraining from the use of violence. Furthermore, who is to be responsible for actually checking up on proportionality and appropriateness? Frontex is having its competence clearly expanded as the lead body in border patrols and as the body that produces risk analyses, on the basis of which interventions and the return to their homelands of thousands and thousands more migrants will take place. Heaven knows how hard Parliament struggled to obtain improvements, but they will make no difference to the fact that a wolf is still a wolf, even if it is dressed in sheep’s clothing. Frontex is not necessary either as a border agency – the national defence institutions serve that purpose – or to repel migration, as migration is not, in fact, repelled, but merely territorially displaced. Frontex is absolutely not suitable to act as custodian of human rights, given that, ultimately, it categorises people as legal or illegal. People cannot be illegal! I do not understand how that is not accepted. In place of Frontex, what we need is a humanisation of the refugee situation, in Africa, for example, where almost a million refugees live in degrading conditions. That does not interest us, or only does so to a limited extent. We would rather take care of ourselves. We need an asylum system that demonstrates solidarity, at European level too, of course, and we definitely need a new neighbourhood policy on an equal footing. That, too, still lies ahead. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what kind of anachronism is this when, 22 years after the historic fall of the Berlin Wall, an EU Member State like Denmark re-introduces border controls? This is a dire warning for the entire European Union. We all know that the Schengen agreement does indeed allow for temporary border controls to be introduced in special circumstances, as we saw with the football World Cup in Germany in 2006. The Schengen system does not need any additional mechanism. If the Danish Government re-introduces permanent controls at its borders with Germany and Sweden, that constitutes an infringement of the agreement. I expect nothing less from the Commission than to treat this as what it is – an infringement of the agreement. This genie must be re-bottled, as freedom and freedom of movement are not up for negotiation; they are fundamental values that shape the European Union. They cannot be sacrificed to national vanities and the extreme Right. We do not need to change the Schengen agreement. We need more humanitarian asylum and migration laws. We do not need additional customs officials on the German-Danish border – what we need are steps to protect refugees and people fleeing from civil war. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already adopted a number of resolutions on the subject of passenger name records (PNR), which include specific requirements. In all cases these have been concerned with necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and the prohibition of profiling. We consider the legal basis of the agreement with Australia to be inappropriate. The agreement with Australia is aimed at harmonising the transfer of data prescribed under Australian law with European law, and particularly the law on data protection. An absolute requirement, therefore, is that reference must be made to Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Moreover, we would question once again its proportionality. If you bear in mind that, according to the Australian Government, in 2009 just five people were traced and accused of terrorist offences – and it was not even clear whether this was achieved as a result of PNR data – then it does not seem particularly proportionate for millions of records nonetheless to be retained for years on end. As we all know, when it comes down to it they are being used for profiling purposes – and we do not even have a uniform agreed definition of profiling yet. I do not know how often the Commission has already been asked for such reasons to prove that the transfer of PNR data is necessary, or to present and look into alternatives. A really substantive report is necessary if this is to be investigated. One more comment on purpose limitation: how can we ensure that the data is used only for the intended purpose if various third countries conclude agreements with each other under which PNR data is systematically exchanged? This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to ensure this. Moreover, we are awaiting a very clear answer from the Commission on the relationship between PNR and the US Secure Flight programme. As everyone is aware, the purpose of the Secure Flight programme is to exclude so-called potentially dangerous passengers from flights. There have been frequent cases of mistakes being made and passengers being misidentified, as a result of which the persons concerned have been prevented from travelling and have practically no legal means by which to defend themselves. One final word: please do not forget that we are talking not just about self-determination – about self-determination in the sphere of information – but also, and above all, about freedom of movement as a basic right, as laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the intermediate category, I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning, Mr Pieper, for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 2013. However, it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions, in particular those hit by the crisis. We are currently talking about 51 regions. When confronted with so many regions that have been affected, it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category. This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves. In other respects, Mr Pieper’s report contains a great deal of light and shade. Among other things, we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty. We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation. It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Bulgaria and Romania were included in the full application of the Schengen acquis. Think about it – the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union. For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States – including my home country of Germany – totally incomprehensible. The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered. Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments. A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here. For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen. Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council’s impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents. Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one. We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September. To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati. She stated, ‘The Romanians are euphoric citizens. They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve. To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics’. That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to get to the point here. We do not need a new rule on the temporary or any other reintroduction of border controls, either now or in the future. We need to grasp that freedom of movement – and that is, after all, the message of the European Union – is something that you cannot simply displace or circumvent at will. It is a citizens’ right that you cannot simply relativise. Do you want to know what honestly annoys me? We hear a lot said about solidarity. Who is talking about solidarity with the countries of Africa who are currently having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees and will continue to do so – without great debate? Is anyone talking about solidarity with the people who are fleeing war and coming here to Europe? We need to show these people a bit of respect. To be frank, I do not want to discuss any changes to Schengen or any rules whatsoever; I simply want us to deal sensibly with migration once and for all. We will not achieve this by using Frontex as a means of deporting people; we will achieve it by having a democratic and humanitarian asylum law. That is what we should be talking about in Europe and it must apply throughout Europe. That is what we should fight for. That is our real task. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are now to have a general strategy for the Roma, but I am afraid that that not everything in the garden is rosy. That is because the overall proposals that the Commission has placed on the table are far behind the many years of discussions with representatives of the Roma, some of which were held in this House. For years, representatives of the Roma community, both with and without a framework strategy, have been pointing out the need for targeted measures and clear, specific requirements. We do not even have clear sanctions should this strategy not be adhered to. Although there have been some proposals in this direction, no actual sanctions exist, so that the system is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese. The strategy on the Roma must take account of all the significant areas. This is what was agreed. However, what does the Commission have to offer other than the four key points? There is no provision in the structures for the participation and inclusion of the Roma communities in all the decisions that relate to them. There are no structures for the specific implementation of targets. There is no gender perspective. Something that also really irritates me and that I believe to be a scandal is the fact that you are unwilling to undertake any explicit action to combat discrimination against the Roma community. You complain that the EU structural funds for the Roma are not used. I would like to ask you quite openly: Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date? I think so. We, as members of the GUE/NGL Group, are highly critical of this communication. We do not believe it to be adequate and I expect the appropriate amendments to be made. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to address three points. Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so. I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany – above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest. Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration – that is how I would describe them – are null and void. Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmström mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy’s idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million. Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled. Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing. Frontex and Dublin II – we need a rethink where these are concerned. We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to get right to the heart of the matter, this is all about introducing a uniform, mandatory EU strategy, instead of the 27 individual, differing strategies in the Member States. Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens. What is it all about? It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone. It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe. It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services. We are not doing these people a favour. We are granting them their legal rights. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti. We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding. There is, though, one thing I would like to add. None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe. We must see this as one of Europe’s central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination. We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole. We must speak with one voice. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children’s home. He wrote: ‘I have found my parents again. We are being transported to the concentration camp. After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death. Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me. Greetings to you all. See you in heaven. Robert.’ Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold. The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over. We need the whole truth about this chapter of history. The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again. We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people. We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions. Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction. The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States. The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this. A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important. It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular. However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive. Therefore, in a year’s time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs. They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made. It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status. It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part. It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking. We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging – which I openly admit – and also in many respects with illegal migration. It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and – what to me is the most important point – that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors. I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive. Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability. Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction. If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated. I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports. Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will simply ask the question: what is the situation with regard to anti-discrimination and the equal treatment of Roma in Europe? When we now hear that ethnically motivated databases on the Roma – and I believe these databases as such are prohibited – are being set up by the French Gendarmerie, but also by other countries, and, to a certain extent, for preventative purposes, then that really is the limit. Both in France and in the EU, databases that are primarily used to compile personal data on the racial or ethnic origin of people are quite simply prohibited due to the high risk of them being misused and on account of the risk of discrimination. Only under very particular – purpose-specific – circumstances, which take non-discrimination into consideration, can the collection of data of this nature be carried out at all. The Roma must not be criminalised, and that is the crucial point. Ethnically motivated databases for the purpose of preventing crimes are unlawful. The Roma must not be the subject of the special collection of data on account of their way of life, and we expect the Commission, in other words you, Mrs Reding, to repudiate any form of ethnic or racist data collection and to work hard to ensure that this is indeed stopped in the relevant countries. Frankly, I ask myself more and more what it is other than talk, talk, talk that actually happens in this Parliament and in the framework of the EU, and what, in practical terms, we have actually managed to do to improve the situation of the Roma in Europe other than talk, talk, talk. If we look at the collection of data, we see that the Roma have become scapegoats and people to push around in many Member States of the EU. They are being deported to Kosovo and, in doing this, France has been contravening EU treaties for months, the principle of anti-discrimination is being violated – and the Commission behaves as if it is satisfied – and I see this rather differently to the previous speaker – with the promise by the French Government to provide the legal basis for transposing the directive on freedom of movement by the beginning of 2011. In the interests of decency, however, it must be said that France has to put a stop to the deportations of Roma, and it is also important for those Roma who have been unjustly deported to have their return to France facilitated. In connection with the databases, I would like to ask you: what definite information to you have, what initiatives will you take, if these databases actually exist in this way, and will you initiate treaty infringement proceedings in such cases? Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should ask ourselves what we are actually trying to achieve with this whole debate. Are we trying to bring about a small improvement in equality and a little assistance for families as cheaply as possible? Of course, making family life compatible with work costs money. I would simply like to ask my fellow Members from Germany: what is expenditure of EUR 1 billion in Germany if, at the same time, we are handing out EUR 450 billion in bank guarantees? What do we actually want in this area? Full pay for parental leave is quite correct. What else should it be? It is not time off, it is not holiday; this is work that people are doing. Of course we want the period extended to 20 weeks, because we believe that this is the only way this work can be accommodated. Moreover, we do not merely want to bring about a bit more equality in working life. We want complete equality, for women and men. We need to take drastic steps if we are to achieve this, such as a statutory minimum wage in all Member States. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my thanks to Mrs Fajon for her excellent report, which has really moved us forward on this issue. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is very clear in its support for visa liberalisation throughout the Western Balkans, and in this case we are, of course, also in favour of the removal of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, specifically so that the opening up of these countries actually gets under way and because it will provide better opportunities for their overall development. We hope that such opportunities will really be exploited. Personally, I would also like to see this kind of arrangement in place for Kosovo very soon – or at least for initial talks to take place. There is an urgent need for this, as Kosovo is otherwise a small island in the Western Balkans that is actually cut off. What worries me, however – and I want to make this point – is that we are compelling the introduction, at the same time, of biometric data. I want to be very clear on this: the use of biometric data is as controversial as ever and, above all, the use of such data is not secure. I say this on the back of news in Germany a few days ago that the PIN codes can be, and have been, cracked. There needs to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen. Let us do everything we can to ensure not only that these countries have their visa requirement lifted, but that social and economic development is set in train there. There is an urgent need for this in both countries, and the people have earned it. We in the EU should also work towards this goal. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called voluntary exodus of the Roma from France is a clear case of expulsion – and indeed of the largest and oldest population group that constitutes a minority in Europe. This will encourage those on the political right, the extreme right. We must reject this – including here in the European Parliament. This is vital. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left therefore demands an end to these deportations. Mrs Reding, I would have liked you, too, to call for us first to demand an end to these deportations and then everything else that follows on from that. President Sarkozy’s government is contravening EU law, because it is carrying out the wholesale deportation of Roma, who originate from EU Member States, without consideration of individual cases, because it is invalidating the principle of free movement, it is violating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is violating the Charter with regard to equal treatment. I say to you in all sincerity that it is finally time for action. We have already discussed this problem numerous times. We now need to take real measures that will bring about a change. The Roma are at home in Europe. They are part of the European Community and should also remain so. We must make sure of it. We are therefore also critical of the deportation of Roma from Germany, Austria, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and other countries in the Western Balkans. We need an integrated European strategy, and one for all Roma, not only some of them. We must fight for this. My final point is that the European idea of solidarity and self-determination must be evident in our dealings with the Roma minority, otherwise it does not exist. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate must focus on two aspects. One aspect, namely that of data protection, has now been very frequently addressed. It is quite true that some things have been improved, but the simple fact is that the transfer of bulk data has not been eliminated. What really annoys me the most is that, where data protection is concerned, Europol has, in fact, been given an extension of its powers: on what legal basis, we ask? However, I also wish to say quite clearly that there is also another aspect, about which we must talk very seriously, namely that even if all the data protection problems were to be solved, every last one, the question would remain whether the principle according to which the bank data of millions of people in Europe is transferred for prevention purposes actually makes a real contribution to the fight against terror. I doubt it profoundly, and there has been no evaluation and nothing to support it. Instead, a de facto
 surveillance of citizens will be introduced, and I wish to remind you that even the Data Protection Officer does not see the necessity of such a regulation. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, first of all, let me say that I believe – and I am referring to the Schengen Information System here – that the EU should not be operating a wish-based policy, but a policy based on the reality. When it comes to the Schengen Information System, that means that we must take account of the fact that the tests – what have been called the ‘first milestone’ – have failed. After eight years of tinkering, we know that the aim of the measure proposed by the Commission – the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II – is unachievable by the Member States, both on technical and legal grounds. That is not my evaluation – it is the evaluation of the Federal Republic of Germany. That is the position back in my home country, and it is a position, by the way, that I fully share. EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme, and the Commission would like to spend more. We do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013; we want to make that very plain. Instead, we want to abandon this system and start the search for an alternative. Secondly, the German Left Party is fundamentally critical of SIS II – I want to point that out, too, at this juncture – as access to the system is being dramatically extended, for example, to the secret services. In Germany, there is a requirement that the secret services and the police are separated. Thus, any mixing of the secret services’ and the police’s data will mean that the whole system will be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court. That is something that I needed to mention, at least from the German point of view. We also oppose SIS II because it involves the collection of vast quantities of data and the gathering and recording of biometric data. That is neither purposive nor proportionate.

Madam President, freedom over the clouds, as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang, will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data. In August, a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having. Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists, the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space. As we all know in this House, this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding. Today, US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data – credit card numbers, booking data, seating preferences, special food preferences, IP addresses and passenger information – without clear data protection regulations. I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that, as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying, referred to as PNR, as it now is to be developed. We cannot support it as it is currently formulated, because it is not for a specific purpose, and it is not proportionate or useful. Finally, I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour. We need disclosure regulations like the USA’s privacy act. These must be opened to European citizens. The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague who is unable to be here and I would like to make a few remarks. The first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the Structural Funds. There are certainly some things which we would criticise and Mrs Schroedter has mentioned these, but I believe that we should not hold back for this reason alone. We welcome the simplification and are also of the opinion that the regulation must be implemented urgently. Too much time has already been wasted. However, I must speak openly. The compromise is not exactly how we had envisaged it. As everyone is aware, the Commission submitted another proposal relating to the one-off 100% payment of interim payment claims for a limited period and for the purpose of labour market policy measures. This was not accepted for a variety of reasons which were discussed in detail in the Committee on Regional Development. However, we must ask ourselves whether we have done enough to put in place what the Commission referred to in its communication of 3 June 2009 as a common commitment to employment which can be used to counteract the crisis. The objective was to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to help overcome the crisis and this is what we are discussing now. The European Structural Funds in particular are, as everyone knows, one of the main tools for investing in citizens and for combating the crisis and creating jobs. If we take a look at Europe, it becomes clear that the crisis has had a huge impact on the labour markets in the Member States and that action really is needed. There have been massive increases in unemployment, not only in the five countries, but in all the Member States, if we look at the situation in detail. In addition, unemployment also plays a major role independently of the crisis. In Europe, we have a very high level of unemployment which is still rising and is unrelated to the crisis. The alternative proposal submitted by the Commission certainly represents a step forward, which we welcome, because at least five Member States with a GDP that has fallen by 10% since 2008 will receive a relatively large subsidy. These Member States will benefit from this and from additional advance payments from the Cohesion and European Structural Funds. All of this is good, but we would like to see more being done. You know what our position is from what we have said in the committee. On the one hand, we are happy and, on the other hand, not so happy, but every step forward takes us forward too and this is where we should be going.

 Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, I think we believed that we had only a limited chance and therefore decided against it. I assume that my colleague thought the same thing. When I looked at the Commission’s overall initiative, I was thrilled. However, after long discussions on these subjects in the last few days, I have learnt a few things. I would have liked to see more. It is true that we could have submitted an amendment, you are right. However, if we are honest with one another, we know what will happen and this is why my group decided against an amendment. I must take note of that myself. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, thank you very much. We have two amendments, one of which is an amendment to the amendment. I would like to introduce both of them. We would like the words ‘the Council and’ to be deleted. The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be:  ‘calls on the Member States to refrain from forced repatriations of minorities if they face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment once they have been forcibly returned’. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, in December 2009, when I was in Pristina and Mitrovica and saw how people are living in the Mahala and, in particular, in the lead-contaminated camps, I was rather shocked, particularly about the plight of the children. In almost every conversation I had, I was told that, not only in Kosovo, but also in many countries in Europe, the situation is dire for one of the oldest population groups in Europe, namely the Roma. I met Bekim Syla from the Roma and Ashkali Documentation Centre in Pristina, who received us with the words ‘We are tired of talking’. Action needs to be taken, and therefore our absolute highest expectation of the Córdoba Summit is that there will be more than mere talk and that action will be taken immediately. Immediate action means not resting on our laurels behind the EU directives implementing the principle of equal treatment, of equal treatment of persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, and also the Employment Framework Directive, because it will not do any good. Immediate action requires the recognition and assumption that these directives are not sufficient to protect the Roma in the European Union from degrading and discriminatory treatment and – most importantly – to enable their permanent integration. What we need, therefore, is a European Roma strategy that is a component of all policy areas – an integral component of all policies. However, the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures. What we need are medium and long-term political initiatives. We urgently need measures for the economic development of the Roma communities. The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible; it must do so now, so that the Roma can also benefit from it. This includes micro-credit loans, which need to be issued with as little bureaucracy as possible, for example, for the reconstruction of Roma settlements. It includes very specific measures for the promotion of health and for education, training and the development of the labour market. I would like to make it quite clear that no child should fail because of educational or language barriers. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left does not want Roma schools, but schools for everyone, where the Roma can also live and learn. I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism. Antiziganism must not be regarded as or remain a trivial offence, but must be punished as a crime. The EU bears a lot of the responsibility for the extent to which, it is to be hoped, we will soon succeed in bringing about justice for the more than 10 million Roma in Europe, because it starts with justice and should continue with equality. For this, we need a very clear political ‘yes’ and a resolute, powerful European framework strategy, and – quite frankly – it also needs our passionate commitment, as MEPs and as people, to this population group – the Roma and Sinti. Let us take action now. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is absolutely indisputable that body scanners quite clearly represent an invasion of privacy and a serious invasion at that. We need to ask ourselves two questions. The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism. We do not currently have any clear answers to this question. This is why I support what Mrs Malmström has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners. I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else. The second question concerns the risks to health. Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week. I would have to do so at least twice a week. This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health. No real assessments have been carried out in this area. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made. Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, human trafficking is, in reality, a scourge of the present day, and it feeds on poverty and ignorance. Its worst form is the trafficking of children, which is often linked to sexual abuse. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left believe that there is an urgent need for action on the Commission’s part. One of the most important prerequisites for successfully combating human trafficking is strengthening the rights of the victims. Only if this succeeds – and not only through punitive measures – can human trafficking be combated at all. That requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims. One of the things these victims need is effective protection and support before, during and also after criminal proceedings in which they testify as witnesses. This must be a high priority for the period of reconsideration, specifically, as well as where witness testimonies are retracted. Long-term witness protection programmes are urgently needed. Another thing that I think is important is that all victims of human trafficking, not just children, must be given free counselling. When dealing with children it is also necessary – coming back to this point – for it to be made possible to make use of child-specialist lawyers. There is a need for urgent measures to strengthen prevention, such as training for lawyers, the police, judges and counsellors. I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency intends to address this issue. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission’s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased. In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions. Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed. The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan. Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy. We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy. Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education. The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here. This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters. However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances. Time is running out! Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be giving the resolution its backing. The Stockholm Programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day. Its main error is that a Europe of rights is being created to which EU citizens will be granted access but others who live in Europe will not. These other people will not be entitled to the same human and civil rights. The EU wants to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights – something that we welcome – yet, at the same time, migrants are to be separated out according to the ‘legal or illegal’ principle. Frontex is therefore being tooled up to wage war on so-called illegal migration, completely obscuring the idea of an unprejudiced immigration policy from view. This is where Stockholm fails. Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security. It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being. Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU’s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis. This will mean the shredding of people’s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality. Allow me, as an MEP from eastern Germany, to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vehemently reject the measures being taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to deport Roma and other minorities to Kosovo. Soon, around 2 500 people are to be deported per year. These measures particularly affect 10 000 Roma, but also Egyptians and Ashkali. Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence. People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France. I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable. The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation. Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica. Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered. A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case … (The President cut off the speaker) Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 I generally believe that exemptions from and relaxation of visa rules are positive moves for the coexistence of peoples and for improving cooperation between countries. For the Western Balkans, in particular, it is important that all the countries of the region should be granted such a prospect. I therefore very much welcome the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are to be included in these regulations. Visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the Western Balkans, however. That would be the case if only Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats were able to enjoy exemption from the visa requirement while Bosnian Muslims were not. I also argue in favour of medium-term solutions for Kosovo. In so doing, I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law. That does not relieve us of the obligation to consider how this state and its citizens are to be dealt with in future, however. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, first I should like to say that we do not share the concerns of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is perfectly simple: we believe that further development towards SIS II is not necessary and is politically wrong. We take this view for three reasons: firstly, because it mixes secret service and police data, giving rise to a data system that no longer guarantees controllability and in which personal data is not, in fact, protected. The second is biometric data, which is being anchored here as a large-scale experiment and, thirdly, SIS II is, of course, to be used against so-called illegal immigration. Hence our proposal: as we all know, we have SIS I. We consider it reasonable to develop this further ‘as one for all’
. It is a pragmatic approach, even if we are strongly criticised for it. However, we believe that, with the approach being pursued here, nothing more can be done. To put it simply: SIS II is a de facto
 failure and to keep on crawling round it – to put it one way – is meaningless. What is important is that money which is being put to the wrong use here should be saved, which will mean we have fewer problems with the whole thing and can stop worrying about the delay with SIS II. I say this also from the point of view of Saxony, a region of Germany close to Poland and the Czech Republic. I know full well here that it would certainly make more sense to do something towards stabilisation within the police than to introduce something like this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a new MEP, let me start by saying that human rights issues are also extremely important to my party, the German Left, and that we condemn any violation of human rights – irrespective of where or by whom they are committed. That has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs. I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that, time and again, human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered. Natalia Estemirova, Stanislav Markelov, Zarema Sadulayeva, these are examples of murders that are truly shocking. It is therefore important that we in this House concern ourselves with this issue. I am concerned that cases like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya are not investigated. If this process is now re-opened, I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested, because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind. What we expect is simply for an immediate and full investigation to be carried out into these murders and for this matter to be dealt with ruthlessly, for Russia not to wait any longer but to take up the fight to protect human rights itself. It must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death. I also believe that the forthcoming EU-Russia summit needs to tackle these issues as a matter of urgency, and not merely as side issues, but with the prominence that they deserve. Personally, I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this House. I would have preferred not to debate issues such as these on Thursday afternoon and I believe this topic should also concern us even if it was about enterprise and trade. Such issues are often given secondary priority. That is what we want to change and that is also something I wanted to say here. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Commissioner, thank you. I want to thank all participating colleagues, in particular the rapporteurs and the team involved in negotiating the result. I also want specially to thank the NGOs and civil society which have ensured that pressure from outside Parliament encouraged us to take up the responsibility in this directive, in particular the NGO Publish What You Pay, because of their struggle for the items included in our directive. But they have achieved only the first step. Ecological and employment criteria form part of the responsibility we have to take into account. We also want to recognise that the requirement of country-by-country reporting of taxes and other financial data by companies in all sectors has to be included, and I guess that the discussion is just now under way among Member States and the Commission about extending  financial transparency to all sectors, as I have already said earlier, especially to tackle the widespread tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance that costs governments billions of euros each year and which belongs to the theme we have been discussing here.

Mr President, even though it is late, this is a matter on which we are doubtless all agreed: investments are important. The rule of law is a central prerequisite for the flow of investments. Ensuring compliance with the law, however, is a task for the courts.  Commissioner, you want to ensure, in binding national agreements between the EU and third countries, the right for investors to take action against governments, leaving judgment to trade specialists to whom environmental or other social interests do not matter. With this law you deprive the governments of the Member States of the right to defend their own political majority decisions, such as the withdrawal from nuclear energy. You even want to be able to force them to relinquish their position and take over the position of the Commission. What is the point then in having elections?  Internationally the number of such lawsuits has increased more than tenfold to nearly 500 at this moment in time. It is a mighty billion-dollar arbitration industry in its own right. On average we are talking about USD 8 million in legal costs and over USD 100 million in compensation claims per case. This law creates the foundations for the plundering of the European Union and its Member States by specialised law firms and corporations. From which budget line do you want to pay for lost lawsuits? That is not clear, and we have to discuss the whole issue at length. I also want to thank the rapporteur; while we were discussing the report, we established that this question is still open and on the table. I would also like to expand on the third question we raised. Companies in the European Union have to go via the ordinary courts, but you wish to enable investors from the outside to make use of the State method, which provides for far greater sums and compensation for damages. Do you intend to encourage companies to establish a branch abroad and then sue the EU or its Member States as an external plaintiff? A recent study concludes that in the text foreseen on the agreement with Canada, the CETA agreement, the wording on the table enables exactly this procedure, and legal action could soon be started against us, for example regarding the legislation prohibiting or regulating fracking.  I therefore cannot agree to the proposed bill and we will probably reject it, but I would like to receive certain answers to the questions we raised. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, I want to stress very clearly that the disappearance of Sombath Somphone is a most worrying example of the practice of arbitrary arrest by elements of the police. The world is watching this case very closely. I urge the Government of Laos to do its utmost to find and release Sombath Somphone. I call on High Representative Lady Ashton to make it absolutely clear that the outcome of this case will be a benchmark for the rule of law in Laos and that it will be crucial for the judgment on whether or not Laos qualifies for an enhancement in our relations, including trade relations. I welcome the fact that our colleagues from the ASEAN parliaments have already undertaken a fact-finding mission to Laos and I call on the ASEAN Human Rights Commission to set up immediately a committee to investigate the events surrounding the enforced disappearance of Sombath Somphone.  Finally, we will be watching closely in future because Laos has to understand that we will make the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as environmental and labour standards, a precondition for further relations between us and them.

Mr President, yesterday we had a very sensitive, emotional debate on the trade agreement on Colombia and Peru. It was a controversial issue for several political groups. My group will therefore ask Parliament to withhold its consent today and send the agreement back to the Committee on International Trade, for three main reasons which I have circulated to Members, and you can read in your mailboxes. Firstly, we have a study which explains that there is no provision to control and monitor financial flows in the agreement with Colombia and Peru, the two biggest coca exporters, whereas there are such provisions in other FTAs. On the one hand, the agreement seeks to close the window for tax evasion, tax fraud and money laundering, while on the other hand, it opens doors wide open to similar activities. The second reason is the human rights situation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and several trade unions have explained that the human rights situation is not such that we should consent to the conclusion of this agreement.  Thirdly, the trade unions, ETUC and other such organisations are asking us not to give our consent. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Jörg Leichtfried. In my view, he has succeeded in devising a way forward which all the groups can support. I know from experience that the negotiations that lie ahead will not be easy, especially as a number of Member States have what I can only describe as an allergic reaction to the issue of delegated acts. Despite the lip service paid in fine speeches to the importance of the European Parliament and how it should be granted more powers, these same government representatives are refusing to recognise Parliament’s equal role to the Council, as an legislator with equal rights, when it comes to amending the legislative procedure. As a legislator, however, we are prepared to delegate powers to the Commission in specific cases, subject to a limit in time, while retaining a right of veto.  The Council is no longer the only institution to sit at the table with the Commission. I therefore urge the Council to stop dragging its feet. Due to this issue, we have already lost far too much time on a number of important dossiers. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, we should give very careful consideration to the causes and the effect. We are in danger of taking a very short-sighted view of complex economic and social developments and, with populist actions, unleashing a trade war with China. That is the last thing the European Union needs at present! Yes, we need fair trade and fair production, but what has actually happened? As a result of cutbacks in the support schemes in Germany and other countries, the photovoltaic market was artificially constricted, resulting in increased competition. If this triggers a major dispute at the political level, we jeopardise the trade links of manufacturers of polysilicon, as well as putting exports in other sectors at risk. We also jeopardise the global supply of technologies that we urgently need for the transformation of our energy systems. Mr Jadot has already highlighted the challenges associated with renewable energies. Our discussions about the EU budget and the positions of the EU Member States on drastic budget cuts also have implications for the issue that is the subject of this debate. We cannot achieve a solution through confrontation. We can only do so through cooperation. I would therefore urge the Commission to make arrangements as soon as possible, as time is really pressing, for a joint forum for European, US and Chinese manufacturers and to support networking between developers, producers and distributors in these three key regions.

Madam President, Commissioner, 92.72727 % was the result celebrated by President Lukashenko’s associates in the most recent parliamentary elections. Otherwise, everything is following an all-too-familiar pattern: the election observers deliver their detailed verdict on the obviously-not-free-and-fair nature of the elections, we adopt our motion for a resolution and the Council imposes a few more sanctions or extends the existing ones. Beyond the Bug, the new parliament remains without an opposition and, therefore, exempt from criticism and correction, while those who want to see a different Belarus are still excluded, persecuted or locked up. The daily lives of Belarusians are still governed by the arbitrariness of politics and the greed of oligarchs.  In the description and assessment of this development, there is barely anything to choose between the political groups of this House. I also believe that nobody expected any other result or any changes to take place in Belarus. However, if that is true, then I must, at this point, reiterate the doubts I have already expressed on repeated occasions. Sanctions appear to be ineffective as a tool. They have not previously had any serious impact, either in Belarus or elsewhere.  Mr Füle has spoken again on the EU’s current activities as regards Belarus. We consider much of that to be worthwhile, such as the direct engagement with civil society under the European dialogue on modernisation. The problem with these activities, however, is that they fail to address Belarusians in their specific circumstances as consumers and workers. People want to discuss the job market, not industrial relations, co-determination rights or compliance with International Labour Organisation or environmental standards and so on. However, if these sessions are not used to tackle the issues of social justice faced on both sides of the Bug, then the foundations of the autocratic system undeniably still in place in Belarus will barely shake.  I would like to conclude with the following point: when we lived in a divided Europe, it was extremely important that, in spite of all the criticism levelled at those in power, a line of communication was kept open. Historically, we have shifted from sanctions to dialogue. It seems to me that, at present, we are moving in the opposite direction. In view of the obvious ineffectiveness of this policy, the question is: what do we do when we have exhausted all the options, when we have tightened the last thumbscrew? It is better to begin to confront the political leaders of Belarus with our arguments and demands in the context of political dialogue. That requires the EU Member States to cast aside their contradictory policy. The use of sanctions against repressive states does nothing to alter the repressive system of the State in question.

Madam President, Commissioner, as we discuss – not for the first time – the accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the Russian Federation, it is easy to forget that trade with the Russian Federation is, and in my opinion will continue to be, of strategic relevance to Europe because there is so much of it and because of the direction it is taking.  I would like to respond to the report by Mr Sturdy, since he examines the status of the relationship with the Russian Federation from economic perspectives, taking Russia’s accession to the WTO, after years of negotiation, as the reference point. I am grateful to the permanent rapporteur for trade negotiations with the Russian Federation for not allowing himself to ignore troubling news about social conflicts, increasingly arbitrary behaviour by the authorities and new, ambivalent legal situation in Russia, but for sticking soberly to the facts.  There are policy areas that cannot just be subsumed under the logic and dynamism of foreign policy. We have talked about this here several times before. Parliament should also form policy with a view to economic cooperation and create trade relations independently of political trends. I welcome the fact that the Commission representatives here in Parliament recently made a commitment to guarantee the stability of this relationship and, as a consequence, to take the Russian leadership at its word regarding the modernisation of the country and its interest in having the EU at its side as a partner. One of the major lessons of the earlier conflicts in Europe is that rapprochement brings change. Mutual rapprochement works in the 21st century but only on an equal footing and through joint efforts. Trade is not an instrument for this rapprochement but does have exactly this effect. This change, which, along with further economic cooperation, we feel is justified, should have as its aim a movement towards greater social justice, less poverty, greater democracy, obviously greater rule of law and thus respect for human rights. We know that the rule of law without democracy – or vice versa – does not work. However, greater democracy without greater social justice, greater application of trade union rights, international labour norms, environmental standards, etc. is even worse. This also applies to the serious consideration of the impacts of the Russian Federation’s accession to the WTO, which in the medium term are not easy to predict, on jobs in industry, the service sector and elsewhere.  I believe we should also take a fresh look at trade barriers. What is really preventing trade with Russia at present is not only trade barriers as we define them but also the continued existence of the visa requirement. The statements at the EU-Russia summit in this regard read well but have not added anything of substance yet. We ought to change this. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an intelligent agreement between the EU and Japan would lead to stronger integration of the two economies. It goes without saying that 128 million potential customers in high-wage Japan offer very attractive prospects for European companies and their workforces in a range of sectors. Mutual integration of know-how in production chains could improve the global competitiveness of thousands of supplier companies. As you hear, I am using the subjunctive, because both your report this evening, Commissioner De Gucht, and important paragraphs in the EP resolution now before us make no offer of partnership; rather, they make unilateral demands to Japan. In my view, that is not a good starting point for long-term cooperation that brings mutual benefits. What we are discussing this evening is the mandate for the negotiations. I am in favour of a clear, frank and open-ended discussion of the differences between the EU and Japan around the negotiating table. A real partnership cannot be based on either side dictating terms. That is why, as a Group, we have problems with the text of the resolution. Let us have a look at it. There are large chunks of the text that appear to have been written by the car industry. At a time when we are facing a climate crisis, how can we seriously demand a commitment from the Japanese Government to abolish the special treatment for electric and hybrid vehicles and the concessions for micro vehicles such as Kei-Cars
, just so that we can export more diesel-powered vehicles? The resolution’s over-emphasis on the abolition of non-tariff measures also conflicts with the findings of the Copenhagen study on trade between the EU and Japan. This study recognises that many of these measures help to improve general welfare, especially in the fields of health, the environment and consumer protection. We should therefore look at what the proposed arrangements are intended to achieve and seek an outcome which brings benefits to society but still promotes trade. Furthermore, companies surveyed have mentioned other reasons why they are deterred from investing in Japan. Above all, there is the language barrier, cultural differences, which also affect consumer preferences, high taxes and wage costs. Anyone who is reluctant to pay qualified translators, or to develop successful marketing strategies to promote their goods in Japan, or to pay local wages and taxes should invest at home instead. These types of trade barrier cannot and should not be removed by an agreement. In this context, the Committee on International Trade gained some very interesting insights last year into the strategy pursued by IKEA, a very large company that has tailored its operations to suit Japanese consumption patterns, culture and social standards. We need an agreement with non-tariff elements of cooperation. Joint programmes can bring together businesses and trade unions, consumer associations, academics, administrators and young people from Europe and Japan. Let us work towards a new culture of cooperation. That would also bring practical benefits for Europe’s SMEs in terms of energy efficiency and high-tech cooperation. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a proposal from you, Commissioner, that has the potential to do enormous damage to Europe’s reputation. While our partners are still engaged in negotiations with the Commission, you are looking to put a gun to their heads, forcing them to capitulate under the threat of exclusion from the European market. Your approach has completely discredited the European Union as a partner in negotiations. Ambassadors from all the relevant countries have vividly described to me what is at stake for them and their population. The Committee on Development, armed with excellent and reliable barometers of mood in the African partner states, has recognised this and has therefore completely rejected the Commission’s proposal in the statement from my colleague and group chair Gabi Zimmer. My group is strongly supportive of this position, even in view of the trade-related aspects. I would call on all Members of this House, including my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, to take this development policy perspective to heart and not to risk decades of close cooperation because of a short-sighted unilateral decision by the Commissioner for Trade. We will have a roll-call vote. Commissioner De Gucht, your regulation would be devastating for the East African community. You risk isolating Kenya from the other Member States or causing this association of states to wave goodbye to Europe as its most important partner. A number of trading nations around the world would be happy at this development. You have made an unjust accusation against the Africans. You are seeking to punish a delay for which you yourself are responsible. Why, for example, is the Commission insisting on abolishing export taxes? Namibia only levies such taxes on raw materials exports. If primary processing takes place in Namibia itself, no taxes are payable. I see this as smart and legitimate economic policy, pointing the way for an industrial policy that is completely in line with the objectives of EU development policy. Commissioner, you are taking a very short-sighted approach that runs counter to the medium- and long-term interests of Europe and the expansion of its trade relations. I would call on you to withdraw your proposal. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe have been discussing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) for months, as we also have here in this House. They came to the conclusion that they do not want or need ACTA. They are concerned that ACTA represents a threat to their freedom in the digital world. They are also worried about issues of central data protection. We have learnt during the course of this debate that the Internet has brought a new dimension to democracy and to our lives. It has become an important aspect of the way in which democracy in the European Union functions, particularly over recent weeks and months. The citizens are pinning all their hopes on the European Parliament and relying on it to defend their interests against the Commission, which has negotiated this agreement, Mr De Gucht, with a mandate from the Council over a period of six years. Two years ago, we insisted that more transparency was needed and we succeeded in bringing the secret ACTA negotiations into the light of day. Now we must not postpone this debate. We must come to a decision. We do not need to wait for the Court of Justice of the European Union, because this concerns the content of the agreement, as other Members have already said. We must decide now. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a quite different dimension. We must all work together to bring about change. We live in an age when the ways in which information and knowledge are used are becoming increasingly separated from the concept of private property. We need to develop new structures that will equate to a new legal culture concerning the access to and use of content. Children must acquire an understanding of this area in school. This is the content of the debate about ACTA and it also applies to the debate about the future development of patents, copyright, international trade and economic cooperation in a multilateral and networked world. We also need to discuss this on a multilateral basis with China, Brazil and many other countries within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and to come to an agreement about it. Mr De Gucht, I believe that you are not certain about or fully aware of the revolutionary impact of the Internet. In the case of ACTA, you are continuing to defend a business model from a period in the past when most people still went to a shop to buy records. At that time, it was mainly big non-European companies such as Sony that were making large amounts of money and they treated their artists as if they owned them. Anyone who defends this sort of monopoly is failing to support the interests of the artists. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be a good moment for democracy and for the importance of the European Parliament and that it will allow us to put an end to ACTA. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is not just the European Union that is experiencing economically difficult times. Japan, too, finds itself in a long struggle, which was made even worse by the disaster last year. The EU’s trade agreement with South Korea, a direct competitor of Japan, put the government and businesses of that country under pressure, and that also affects the jobs and overall social situation in Japan. However, while many European governments are often quickly enthused by agreements with developing countries, as these are always negotiated to the advantage of European businesses and investors, the conservatives – including in this House – are currently applying the brakes to the talks with Japan. Aware of Japan’s dire straits, some are even calling for the Japanese to kowtow before real negotiations can take place. Ladies and gentlemen, friends prove themselves in times of trouble. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be ill-advised – as certainly all of us in this House would be, too – to categorise Japan as a beggar now, rather than a partner. The dispute about non-tariff barriers to trade is also something that we should resolve eye-to-eye at the negotiating table. In those negotiations, our aim should not be to cut as many laws as possible that our trading partner has developed. We need to analyse the regulations in dispute based on their purpose and aim in order to achieve a result that provides the social benefit required but which, at the same time, favours the trade of products, without, for example, reducing levels of consumer protection or environmental targets. In addition, we also take very seriously the concerns of Japanese farmers, who see their livelihoods threatened by future European agricultural exports. Similarly, there must be no agreement if the interests of the people of Europe are not safeguarded. My group will certainly not vote in favour of any treaty in which the investment protection chapter grants companies a right of action against governments or the EU.

 Thank you, Mr Caspary. In response to your first question, I do believe it very likely that all or many of the groups jointly submitted this draft resolution. Nonetheless, the questions I asked are of pressing interest, including because they are accepted and considered not merely by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but by all the groups. That is why I pointed out that we need to make progress here with the negotiations. In that regard, it needs to be more than just scoping. We need to go a step further and, as Mr Lange said, also incorporate this consideration when issuing the mandate. The answers to the second and third questions I will provide to Mr Caspary in person.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with this compromise, the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, are asking for Parliament’s consent for a reform that would abolish the European Union’s trade preferences for a number of poor countries. This fact is concealing itself behind the debate about the criteria into which we have already entered, including today. A completely arbitrary limit value has been set on per capita average income, which just happens to exceed USD 4 000 per annum. However, this value tells us nothing about the real distribution of income in many countries. In particular, the inconsistency of development processes in each country is not covered. Do you recall the Treaty of Lisbon? The elimination of poverty is a coherent goal of the foreign policy of the European Union. Your reform will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in countries like Ecuador, thus tipping women, predominantly, back into poverty. I believe that the motivation is clear, and it has even been publicly acknowledged by the rapporteur. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Fjellner for his openness and the mutual respect shown during the debate on this. Countries such as Ecuador are to be forced to conclude a direct free trade agreement with the European Union. We have seen the simple peddling of the argument that the reform aims to help the least developed countries. You are aware of that yourself, as trade potentials will not shift to the weak, but to the strong. Mr Lange, every major development organisation, this House’s Committee on Development, as well as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and numerous national trade unions have leant their support to the amendments and the trend through which we are seeking to revise this regulation. We will bring these amendments up again with Members in plenary, and I strongly urge you to support these amendments and thus help ensure that the European Union does not withdraw from the global fight against poverty. Helmut Scholz,

– Mr President, the Policy Department’s study ‘EU macro-financial assistance: a critical assessment’ provides a useful and telling assessment of MFA operations so far. It shows the impact of both the scope and the volume of the loans and grants to be very marginal in many cases. The new procedures under the Treaty of Lisbon make the process of applying MFA more cumbersome. The consent of Parliament is now necessary for all applications of the MFA, and we understand the willingness of the Commission to simplify the procedures. Mr Kazak – whom I thank, on my own behalf and that of our shadow rapporteur, for his cooperation – proposes to apply the delegated acts procedure in respect of eligible countries and granting assistance to particular countries. As a group, we support this view. Our group is not against the imposition of some conditions but they must be the right ones. Our group considers it a serious mistake to continue to impose, within the framework of the MFA, the same conditions imposed by the IMF. We need to address these challenges, in particular in the light of the current financial and economic crisis. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our citizens are increasingly losing confidence in the European Union and the application of the law practised by its policies in many areas, Mr Martin’s own-initiative report can only be welcomed, and I would like to expressly lend my group’s support to this own-initiative report. It concerns taking further practical steps to assert the right explicitly laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Parliament’s task of exercising political control. I therefore do not agree with the previous speaker that we should not expand the right of inquiry or the rights of the European Parliament in this way, for how can and should Article 226 intervene in practice, in concrete terms, if it becomes necessary to set up temporary committees of inquiry in order to uncover and put a stop to, and I quote:  ‘alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law’. (DE)
 We need a permanent inquiry procedure that functions in real terms, is transparent and creates transparency. Inquiry proceedings do indeed have an important role to play in a parliamentary democracy. They allow parliaments to examine the facts independently and autonomously where they consider this necessary in order to perform their constitutional task of representing citizens. I believe this to be urgently necessary, particularly in the situation which the European Union finds itself at present. One final thought to close: I agree with those Members who have said that minority conclusions are urgently needed. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the coming week, the Chinese Minister for Commerce, Chen Deming, will be holding official talks with Mr De Gucht in Brussels. In this respect, this debate is taking place at the right time and the Chinese will be paying considerable attention to the expectations and opinions of the European Parliament. Ms de Sarnez, despite the constructive cooperation and the many individual points in your report which were correct and which I would like to thank you for, I cannot vote in favour of your report. Everyday life in businesses in Europe, the closure of traditional manufacturing plants, for example, in the textile industry and in the new industries of the future, such as the solar sector, the supply of raw materials to both these huge markets, the challenges involved in global trade and the complexity of current economic policy, in particular against the background of the financial, economic and structural crisis, the challenges of climate change and the current logic of production and growth all show that the report falls short of what we would like to see. We are taking too small a step, even if we perhaps do not need a new major leap forwards. We cannot simply continue our trade and economic policy as before with China and with other so-called emerging markets. We must investigate our business relations, address the contradictions and problems openly and establish clear contractual terms. However, all of this can only take place in the context of developing a common, agreed strategy for cooperation in a genuinely globalised world economy. To achieve this, we need intelligent, forward-looking initiatives. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Aung San Suu Kyi, one of the most symbolic political figures in the world, is once again taking part in the process of shaping her country. The overwhelming support which she received during her election to parliament clearly demonstrates that she carries the hopes of the Burmese people. However, I would like to make it clear that the parliament to which she was elected does not have the power to take the country in a different direction from that planned by the military. In addition, the generals have adopted a constitution which guarantees that they retain control over parliament in future. President Thein Sein could give a clear indication of how serious his desire for change is by not attempting to force the newly elected members to swear to support this obsolete constitution before they are allowed to take up their mandate. I am happy to acknowledge that a series of positive changes have taken place over the last two years. However, I agree with all my fellow Members that the country still has a long way to go. The spotlight on Aung San Suu Kyi must not blind us to the fate of other political prisoners, to the ongoing military action against parts of the population, to the misery of the refugees and to the wealth of a small elite in a desperately poor country. Is real change now on the way or will there be new setbacks? My group supports the call from Aung San Suu Kyi to suspend EU sanctions, but not to lift them permanently. This would give her country the opportunity to overcome poverty and encourage the military to continue along the road to democracy. However, it would also allow us to show that the European Parliament remains vigilant and that a return to dictatorship would have serious consequences. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Füle, my group has been following the developments in Iceland over the last few years and the ongoing and intensive accession negotiations with great attention and sympathy. We see Iceland primarily from the perspective of a country with a very small population which has not only succeeded in bringing about social change in recent years, but has also drawn conclusions about how to resolve the causes of the crisis and taken the necessary measures. We believe that Iceland is very much on the right track. Therefore, my group is also asking itself whether Iceland can bring its experiences, for example, in the area of sustainable energy policy, into the accession process and ultimately into Europe. Some of the solutions it has put in place go far beyond the measures taken to overcome the crisis in the EU. That is what the accession negotiations are essentially about. This presupposes that the negotiations are not only transparent and constructive, but are also on an equal footing as far as their content is concerned and do not have a predetermined outcome. Some of my fellow Members would like to believe that the domestic political situation in Iceland and the accession process are not efficient in political terms. However, the key political consideration is something quite different. The population of Iceland, which, by the way, is very pro-European, because many Icelanders have studied and worked in Europe, has high expectations of the negotiations. Nevertheless, the people of Iceland do not want accession at any price. In the end, they have to weigh up the results. This is a highly democratic process which we should welcome and support. I would like to thank Mr Preda for his very balanced report, but on the basis of these considerations, my group will be abstaining from voting. Why is this? Against the background of what I have said, the report contains points that we cannot support. Two examples of these are that if we accept, as my group does, that the accession process will remain open until the final evaluation of the results of the negotiations, we cannot behave now as if the decision had already been made. Secondly, the report calls in paragraph 5 for a reduction in the state’s influence on the banking sector. However, Iceland had particular challenges to overcome in this area, which we must not ignore. Instead, we must assess what has been done and make use of the findings. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address my words expressly to Mr Swoboda. Your first motion for a resolution was pleasantly balanced and specifically unemotional with regard to what can be said following the presidential elections. In signing the European Convention on Human Rights, the Russian leadership made a voluntary commitment that it is not fulfilling. These elections, too, were once again not fair or free of fraud. Even a EUR 300 million investment in surveillance technology by the government did not solve a problem that can only be solved at a political level. These are the sober facts that do not leave us, as a partner, indifferent. They also highlight the contradictory nature of a Russian society, which, as everyone can see, is nevertheless changing. This is something we should welcome and support, because emerging democracies thrive on efforts to develop and change, and also on protests. Russia is becoming normal. I therefore consider a number of the conclusions drawn by some of my colleagues here in Parliament to be politically wrong. There must be no compromises in the text here, either. This House must finally decide what line it wants to take. At the ‘Russia after the Elections’ event yesterday, organised by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I discovered that some Members are of the opinion that Russia is no longer normal. Was it ever normal? They believe it represents a potential danger and that we cannot simply carry on as before, but must now finally take a different course. I would just like to say something about this. Those who want to think in terms of escalation spirals should now explain how far they want to go with this and, moreover, not only in terms of where that leaves our partnership. For all the justified criticism and all of the differences, partnership for me means, above all, a balance in terms of our common interests, and, at least in my mother tongue, partnership and subordination are not synonyms. People who advocate this path are also saying, as far as I can see, that they do not believe in the power of society to change and that they have not taken note of the changes in Russian society, to which, incidentally, the reports of the election observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) also refer, as here is where alternatives to the Putin-steered democracy are being sought. All of this must, ultimately, be discussed in political terms. The dynamism that some people are currently developing here in this House following the elections is something that I consider to be disconcerting, however. In my view, it cannot be reconciled with the political dignity and self-perception of a House that stands for plurality in Europe if representatives of part of the Russian opposition here in Strasbourg were able, unchallenged, to discredit the alternative presidential candidates by describing them simply as ‘Putin’s pigs’, when these candidates, without rectification of the election fraud, received the vote of more than 25 million citizens in Russia. Despite knowledge to the contrary, these same people have been speaking for weeks in this House, likewise unchallenged, of the possible bloodshed caused by Mr Putin and of potential revolutions. All I can say is that it is not the clear majority in this House that is deliberately taking the wrong course in its criticism of the elections in Russia. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, it is important that on the second occasion in only a short period of time, the European Parliament is condemning the abuse of children who are used as cheap labour or slaves. We are in favour of this agreement. Nevertheless, in the Committee on International Trade, we had a shameful debate about whether we should condemn only forced child labour or also child labour under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In two areas, we may be forced to take a step backwards and, therefore, we need to resolve the issues involved. Mr Sturdy, recital E, which has been tabled by your group, gives the impression that the hard work done by children on the cocoa plantations is harmless. These children are being deprived of the opportunity to take part in education and their future is being taken away from them. We should delete this paragraph. Ms Köstinger and the other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which tabled recital D, want Parliament to turn a blind eye to the fact that children are being abducted and sold in West Africa to do hard and dangerous forced labour on the cocoa plantations. This is the appalling reality in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in particular, as has already been mentioned. I recommend that you watch the documentary ‘The Dark Side of Chocolate’, which reveals that a child costs EUR 230. The children are being abducted from Mali and the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are more than 12 000 children without relations working on the Ivorian plantations. The next time we eat chocolate, we should specifically ask ourselves how many children have suffered to give us this pleasure. We must take a much more decisive approach to combating this problem.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, discussions between the partners about what annoys them and about what changes would increase the common ground between them are an undoubted part of strategic partnerships. More than one area of this kind exists. Therefore, it is increasingly surprising that this House is content simply to give a mutual confirmation of its values. The results of the poll in Russia yesterday should be making us think much more carefully about the situation. The poll showed that the Russian population wants a modern country with a stable economy which is more than just an exporter of raw materials. However, only 7% of the population believes that the EU is prepared to help with the necessary reconstruction. This figure has not only halved, but is also particularly low in areas which are in close contact with the EU. We should be discussing the related issues here, including democratic values, involvement in society, the prospects of the election and the emergence of a political and civil society in the Russian Federation, particularly against the background of the contradictory experiences of the Russian people during the Yeltsin era. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, a strategic partnership must involve a balance of interests on key issues, including people’s living conditions, business relationships based on equal opportunities and the joint challenges that we have to resolve. ‘Strategic’ means giving priority to our common interests as part of this balance. It also means making concrete achievements, ensuring that the political decision-making processes are transparent for everyone, and explaining the electoral procedures. We agree on the fact that nothing can happen without joint security. However, it is difficult to understand why joint security is not being established jointly. The proposals for discussion have been put on the table, including by the EU. The next summit must deal with these proposals. It must come to a binding agreement that the money used to buy more weapons would be better spent on the specific processes for establishing the modernisation partnership. This is in the interest of both sides and also in the interest of our citizens, who want to have their fair share of the economic progress. A prospering economy and a fair society will ultimately make obsolete the arrogant behaviour which comes with power. A society of this kind needs the competence and commitment of all its citizens. The Russian demonstrators made this clear to their government in Bolotnaya Square on Saturday and called for concrete change. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I took over this dossier, I quite honestly did not expect to be negotiating it intensively for more than two years. In my view, that is certainly difficult to explain to the general public, both to citizens within the EU and also to people in our partner countries. It is worth noting that, with regard to the negotiations on the actual content and the tasks of the instrument, it was possible to reach an agreement in a few months. What caused the negotiations to drag on so long was the interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon in respect of the delegated acts and the refusal of some large Member States to actually allow Parliament greater powers of scrutiny. The Council and the European Parliament agreed at an early stage to thoroughly revise the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. We planned to release up to EUR 348 million for cooperation in the fields of science, academic exchanges – including the Erasmus Mundus programme – culture, environmental protection and renewable energy sources and the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration was to be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. That remains the case, but the delay has meant that it will only be possible for a considerably smaller amount to be invested by the end of the current financial framework. That is particularly regrettable because, with the new ICI+, projects in developing countries can also be financed, and this involves projects that do not fall within the general definition of development assistance measures, for example sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America. In the amended regulation we have made clear reference to the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It is clearly stated for whom and for what purpose the additional funds are to be used according to the intentions of the legislators. In the developing countries listed in Annex II, at least 5% of the funds are to be spent in the area of public diplomacy. In specific terms, that means the promotion of dialogue with civil society with regard to the character and fundamental values of the European Union, namely democracy, respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms. At least 20% of the funds are to be invested in the promotion of direct relations between the citizens of the European Union and the partner countries. In addition to an emphasis on academic exchange and the mobility of students, this also involves the interlinking of economic, social and cultural players. At least 50% of the funds are to be spent on the interlinking of economic activities, with the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. The funds are to go mainly to partner countries which comply with the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation and which are involved in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is a new element. With regard to cooperation in the energy sector, the Commission is in any case required to concentrate in particular on cooperation in the area of renewable energy. For the purpose of the minutes and for the information of the Commission and the supervisory authorities: this instrument is expressly not to be used to provide hidden subsidies for the operation of a European telephone company in Colombia or any other country in Latin America. I consider it extremely important and necessary to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. We in Parliament will continually monitor this. For this purpose, we have enshrined in this instrument a special reporting obligation on the part of the Commission – this is a success too. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulation is in line with the spirit of the legislators. In the past the Commission has unfortunately often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. We therefore wanted to enshrine the delegated acts in this instrument and to demand our role and duty as legislators with a right of veto. Therefore, in the interests of those who benefit from the support programme, we did not in the end insist on the relevant wording, but with this instrument as with all the others – and on this point I agree with the other rapporteurs – we will also fight for this democratic right in future too.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only agree with Mr Goerens’s criticism of the Council, as I too would have very much liked to have seen the Council here today. Nevertheless, after all the fine words about compromise and also the areas of disagreement listed at the end of the debate, I would like to take the opportunity to point out once again that the Commission should now submit a completely revised strategy paper for the ICI+. It would be unacceptable for us as legislators to give the instrument a completely new direction and then for the Commission to simply continue with the old strategy paper, which was drawn up even before the legislative amendment and therefore had the old ‘Global Europe’ communication as its reference document. Instead, the legislators have given the regulation a completely new tenor, namely that of a partnership approach and mutual benefit. The legislators are placing the regulation in the context of other key policy goals of the European Union, in particular coherence with development policy, the enforcement of international labour law standards and the combating of climate change. However, the strategy paper continues to ignore this intention, maintaining that the goal of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. As legislators, that was not what we aimed to achieve with this instrument and the corresponding money from taxpayers. The ICI+ is intended to be a modern cooperation programme, not a weapon of conquest. Commissioner, in my view you still have an obligation to implement the will of the legislators in future, too. We do not want to write planning and strategy papers ourselves. We have repeatedly made that clear. That is something that the Commission should continue to do. However, we will utilise our right of veto if the requirements that we have written down have been ignored. Therefore, the proposals for the new generation of financing instruments must employ the principle of the delegated acts wisely. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks there has at last been a positive signal from the US that has made the world sit up and listen. However, this signal did not come from the White House, nor from the Capitol, but from the street. With the Occupy movement, the American people have set an example of resistance against the dictates of financial capitalism that have been followed and seized upon throughout the world. Yesterday, the tents of the protesters were cleared away and numerous people were arrested by the police under the cover of darkness throughout the US in what was clearly a concerted action on the part of the mayors. That is also a signal, indicating the refusal of those in power to take up the demands of the people. However, this is precisely the demand that my group would make of a transatlantic summit. It is not the people who should be arrested, but the fraudsters who are becoming ever richer on profits from subprime credits. The summit, coming just after the G20 summit, ought to consider how wide the gap is now getting between the poor majority of the population and the super rich. The summit ought to take firm decisions concerning the prohibition of usurious interest, whether for private individuals or for entire states. It ought to open its eyes and see that 10% of the population of the United States and the Member States of the EU is now out of work. A quarter of young people have no prospects, and in many regions the figure is even higher than 40%. The financial markets suck the necessary investment capital out of the real economy and out of the national exchequers and deprive them of profits. These enormous problems must be addressed at the summit. To solve these problems we need a new high-quality partnership for cooperation between the US Congress, the European Parliament and the parliaments of the EU Member States in order to define common approaches for the legislation that is urgently needed. An expanded TLD would also be the appropriate forum for addressing further differences between the EU and the US, whether this is – using the list of topics that you mentioned – in peace policy, climate policy or in connection with rights to privacy. As Mr Bütikofer said, the resolution is a long way from achieving this. As a group, therefore, we cannot give the resolution our backing. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, like many of my fellow Members, I would also like to say that we need to be honest and admit that the central task for the Commission in 2012 is nothing less than holding together the European Union. We need to take a joint approach to developing it further. We need more Europe. We must stick together in the interest of the citizens and we must not allow individual Member States to be exposed to attacks from financial capitalism. However, more Europe must not mean less democracy. In 2012, we will undoubtedly have to lay the foundations for the future development of the European Union, which will perhaps come close to being a state. However, in this Europe which resembles a state, decisions must not be made by decree by the Council and the Commission. The groundwork carried out by the Commission for the convention in 2012 must not result in the citizens of Europe and their parliaments being disenfranchised. Instead, we need a more democratic Europe with a focus on peace, environmental change and social progress. Do you not realise, Mr Barroso, that you and the Commission are increasingly being regarded by the people of Greece, Portugal and Italy as their enemy? The Council has succeeded in making you the scapegoat. Brussels is ordering the privatisation of state assets, cuts in wages and pensions, and the removal of protection against dismissal. This is all pure neoliberalism. Stop, Mr Barroso! You must finally turn the Commission into the ally of the citizens. You must defend people against the effects of greed and join with us in 2012 in bringing an end to the business model that has driven entire states to the brink of ruin with extortionate interest rates. You must stop feeding the predators. Instead, you must channel the funds into urgently needed investments in the future and make the financial transaction tax your touchstone. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, what we are discussing here relates to international economic cooperation. We often discuss the financial crisis and rescuing the banks and the euro. Incredible sums of money have been made available that should have been enough to boost employment throughout the world and thereby conquer hunger. We talk far too little about the people whose real existence the crisis has hit. The banks that we are to rescue have driven millions of people into unemployment through their speculation whilst also, at the same time, irresponsibly gambling with people’s pension funds. With the American Jobs Act, President Obama is seeking to finally put the fate of these people back at the heart of politics. His idea of removing financial burdens from businesses that take on new employees is a good one. European policy should learn from the example that the United States is setting. The non-policy of strangling the life out of the economy through lunatic austerity measures must be brought to an end. In difficult times like these, I also give my firm backing to the use of public procurement resources to promote local production. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, whoever it is sitting over there, I urge you to use the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council in December to tackle the issue of unemployment in a concerted manner in this context and to prevent a downward spiral, while counselling a joint new start for economic, employment and social policy. Be sure that the European Parliament will be very actively involved in the transatlantic dialogue between legislators. The Occupy Wall Street movement has not only earned the support of millions of Americans; it will, I hope, also act as an inspiration for the population of Europe. Helmut Scholz,

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Caspary, I acknowledge the fact that, as rapporteur, you have shown yourself within your own group to be thoroughly open to the demand for a modern trade policy with this report. Paragraph 5 of your report in particular emphasises the fact, at last, that trade policy requires coherence with a great many other policy areas as well as future viability, and I expressly support your call for a thorough revision of the trade strategy by Commissioner De Gucht. Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of this report then falls back into the old way of thinking. You want to promote the interests of the EU instead of establishing partnerships. You support an aggressive market access strategy by the Commission, which would weaken the development potential of other countries. You want to use whatever means necessary to secure access to raw materials for European enterprises instead of finally offering fair prices and providing assistance for the development of manufacturing industries. We will vote against this old way of thinking, because the consequence of continuing with this old strategy will, above all, be the extension of the spiral of poverty in most parts of the world. That is short-sighted, also because it will ultimately harm Europe. How do you actually imagine it will end if we pursue competition for the raw materials of the world by aggressive means? Where will we be in 2050? Will all of the states in the world then have a raw materials management strategy like that of Norway? Will it have been possible to develop manufacturing industries? Will Europe have helped them to do this in an environmentally sound way and to create respectable jobs? Europe’s future lies in a smart trade policy that aims to strengthen its partners and which recognises that combating poverty is a prerequisite for its own survival. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I have a question for Commissioner De Gucht. I have just been appointed as a European Parliament standing rapporteur on trade relations with China, as well as on relations between the EU and Ecuador and Bolivia. I would like to ask you two questions regarding these two complexes. Firstly, what is your projection for the development of trade relations between the EU and China by the year 2020, and what are the current issues, or even agreements, in EU-China trade talks? Secondly, you informed yesterday’s Council on Foreign Affairs and Trade that the multiparty agreement with Colombia and Peru remains open for signature by Ecuador and Bolivia. Do you want those two countries to simply sign the negotiated text which is, as you well know, subject to well-founded criticism from trade unions and a number of economists? Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I can agree with your remark concerning the last issue, but that means that if Ecuador wants to have a chapter on trade and cooperation included, as is just now under discussion, and also the specific needs of the new raw materials and public services policy pursued by Bolivia are to be included, then I think we have to come to the point where we have to add this point to the negotiations as well; so not just to simply sign or not sign, but to reopen the understanding of the agreement itself.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this agreement, as a result of which Palestinian agricultural products will now actually be placed on an equal footing with products from other, recognised states in the Mediterranean. I expressly agree with the rapporteur – and I would like to thank her for her work – when she says that this Agreement can help, to a certain degree, to support and strengthen the Palestinian economy, which is currently in crisis, irrespective of the aspects of this Agreement that are still unresolved, to which my fellow Members have referred. How is a permanent peace solution with Israel to be possible if there is no self-supporting economic development in the future state of Palestine, which also is and must be the basis for further democratisation and an embedding of Palestinian society in the region as a whole – I would like to emphasise this point – for dealing with such complex problems as demographic issues, job creation, issues relating to water supply, the construction of housing, and so on, in a constructive and positive way? I also see this as an important signal in view of the current debate in the United Nations with regard to the long overdue recognition of the state of Palestine. Trade policy – and this is specifically addressed to you – can create specific circumstances here that would signify a tangible improvement in living conditions for the local people. That also involves us taking on specific responsibility for the Arab Spring this autumn. This Agreement can surely only be a first step towards comprehensive trade cooperation as partners. In light, in particular, of the important global political decision, however, I would also like, here in plenary, to explicitly express my amazement at the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Up until just before the vote in committee, it threatened to reject the Agreement. As the price for its consent in the Committee on International Trade, it forced the deletion from Parliament’s explanatory statement of the reference to the settlements and blockades by Israel being partly to blame for the poverty and unemployment in Palestine. Shutting our eyes to reality is not a valid position to take, and the facts and challenges still remain. The same applies to the question of the deletion of the passage relating to the circumvention of the rules of origin by Israeli manufacturers. We will not solve the problem by not allowing a spade to be called a spade. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, the resolution that will be passed by the European Parliament gives you a clear mandate in this critical phase of the Doha negotiations: you must press for a positive interim result at multilateral level in Geneva that will contribute to a reduction in the poverty suffered in the world. Everyone gathered here today recognises the status quo, which is why we must have an eye to the future – as Mr Taylor has just said: do you remember the start of these talks? The Doha Round was instigated 10 years ago in the shadow of the attacks in New York and the intention was to contribute to an improvement in living conditions in developing countries by further developing the WTO, thus eliminating the basis for the propaganda of hatred. However, the Commission’s negotiators and those of its competitors are mainly concentrating on the opening up of the global markets for services and penetration into previously protected sectors of general public interest. Developing countries were able to come together within the WTO to prevent this opening up from being forced upon them. In turn, you responded by switching the emphasis to the conclusion of bilateral agreements that enabled you to pursue your chief interests more effectively. This approach has patently failed to help reduce poverty. It actually threatens the establishment of a system of fair trade rules with worldwide validity under the umbrella of the WTO. For this reason, my group urgently calls on you to return to the primacy of multilateral agreement. The least you should do in Geneva is to obtain an agreement for the so-called least developed countries package, which would bring improvements for the world’s poorest. We would also call on you to withdraw the Commission’s threat to abandon the promise to abolish the EU’s export subsidies for agricultural produce should the Doha Round fail. In view of the present catastrophic famine in East Africa and the increasingly difficult situation of the farmers – not just in the developing countries, but there in particular – it is actually necessary to speed up the abolition of export subsidies.

 Madam President, in light of the scope to act that we are afforded as Parliament, we really have to ask, ladies and gentlemen, whether we, too, have sufficient legitimacy for our actions here. Mr Duff’s report – and I very much welcome the many years of work that he has carried out – puts forward specific proposals for strengthening the European element. Some of these will clearly not receive majority support, but he is taking the right approach and it deserves broad support and a public debate, including outside this Chamber. In our group, too, there were heated debates about the specific proposals in the report. This reflects the divergent interests in, and experience with, the European Union. On one point there is agreement. Parliament is not the only place for discussing and taking decisions concerning democracy. Therefore, I give my clear support to the approach taken in the report, which I believe is the right one, and to the report’s call, right from the outset, to go well beyond the negotiating mandate towards the Council. Citizens must be given their own voice in this process and the European political parties must be active in this regard. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, it is not the first time that we have discussed the Arab countries and the upheavals there. While we are debating the developments that have taken place from Syria to Morocco, in my opinion, Parliament is also reappraising its own past, in other words, the cooperation that was at least tolerated between the European Union and countries which we rightly refer to today as having autocratic regimes and whose internal structures we are concerned about. This is a good thing. However, I cannot help but get the impression that we have once again started to relax in the supposed certainty that everything is under control and everything will be all right. The thing which I personally find impossible to deal with is that we are continuing to comment on political processes, but we are still not prepared to put these developments in their national and regional social context and to investigate the causes of these changes. We must finally stop applying double standards in our foreign policy and also in our democratic dealings with one another. We should talk about the interrelationships between EU Neighbourhood Policy and EU policy on the failure to resolve the Palestinian conflict. I very much welcome your commitment to the Quartet. We should discuss the fact that the war against Colonel Gaddafi’s autocratic regime, which some EU Member States and NATO are involved in, is already having dramatic economic consequences in Tunisia. The outflow of capital, Tunisians returning home to look for work, migrants, a collapse in the country’s income from tourism and in its trade relationships are just some of the issues. This war is also playing into the hands of the powers in the military and the political elite in Egypt who want to return to the previous regime. We are now dealing not just with new problems and no longer only with old problems. Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, we need a fundamental political and economic reorientation of the European Union’s foreign policy activities. I believe that this has become clear during the course of this debate. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations with Canada are being conducted with a country that has a strong economy and a highly developed legal system. It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate, if not conceal, an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court. Why ever should an ordinary court not decide on compensation in cases of doubt? Which courts do you, as the Commission, not have any trust in whatsoever? Is it the Canadian courts or those in the European Union? Do you not see that, with this part of the agreement, you would be discriminating against the local undertakings? As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission’s approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a ‘negative list’. This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open. We want to retain public services. I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada’s social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter. The European Parliament is also calling for the protection of workers, payment of overtime, minimum wages and rejection of social dumping. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now almost a year since the people of Pakistan suffered devastating floods. We all have very close ties with the people of this stricken country. What is scandalous, however, is the fact that the negotiations in the WTO are still dragging on, and that alone makes it clear that this form of trade facilitation is not suitable to be used as an emergency aid measure. My group has repeatedly called on the Commission to put forward a plan B in order to be able to help the people of Pakistan quickly and permanently to rebuild their country. No alternative solution has been presented, however. Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council, which it is only too familiar with. Otherwise, it would seem as if the difficult negotiations in the WTO are being used as an excuse for the lack of action. You knew as well as we did that these negotiations would be difficult before they even started and you probably also already knew this when some of the foreign ministers from Germany and other Member States sent you on this mission. After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection. It is precisely this status advantage that enables Bangladesh to import primary products from Pakistan, to process them and then export them to Europe. It is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance. However, we cannot in all honesty expect approval for our desire to help Pakistan at the expense of one of the poorest countries in the world. By doing so, we will ultimately damage ourselves, too, and indeed we will be doing this on the eve of the presentation of the new Commission draft on the revision of our system of trade preferences. My solution to this problem is therefore as follows: place the focus on direct aid for the reconstruction following the floods and take immediate action instead of losing in the negotiations in Geneva. After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the motions for resolutions that the European Parliament has been presented with make it clear to all groups that Parliament – as has already been emphasised – does not feel it is sufficiently informed about the specific status of the negotiations. I am therefore grateful for the more detailed information that we have been given today. The questions from the left side of this House in particular deal directly with the concerns of the people in Europe, but also in India, and these are concerns for their own social and economic situation and the prospects of workers and those looking for work, including in the EU Member States. As we know, the devil is in the detail, so we would like to know the following, Commissioner: what are the specific subjects of the negotiations when it comes to public invitations to tender in the services sector or in connection with labour migration? What text is on the table with regard to intellectual property rights? What is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture? By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world’s poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies. We want to examine whether European local authorities, hospitals or ministries are, in future, to be obliged to make calls for tenders in which Indian companies can also be included. We want to know whether the agreement will regulate the conditions of entry into the Member States of the European Union of Indian nurses or carers for the elderly, including the length of stay and recognition of qualifications. We want to know whether the agreement text will put small-scale farmers and fishermen in India at risk and whether European steel workers are threatened with redundancy because Indian capital will, in future, be able to be invested freely in the purchase of companies in the EU as a result of the agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, just one topic should be the focus of attention when the summit is held between the European Union and Japan at the end of this month: the disaster that has devastated the people of Japan as a result of earthquakes, the tsunami and continuing radioactive contamination, and the concrete role that can be played by the EU, its Member States and individual citizens in helping to deal with the resulting problems in the short, medium and long term. That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people. We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster – particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan. The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy. The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident. For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle. In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement. Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides. That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan. For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work and for trying, in the spirit of the European Parliament, to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides, and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis. This is not a simple issue. It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States with regard to social, economic and employment policy, weighing up the interests of financial groups, big business and economic enterprises, on the one hand, and those of the trade unions and workers on the other. That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen’s should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament. For this reason, I hope that tomorrow’s vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr Füle, Mr Siwiec, thank you for devoting yourself to this subject. Parliament’s almost unanimous opinion is that Neighbourhood Policy has not produced the expected results. I agree with that. However, I do not agree with the analysis of the causes. The results do not meet our expectations because we have not focused on the interests which we have in common with our neighbours. Instead, we have concentrated on our own interests and on our ideas of how neighbouring countries should develop. Quite obviously, what we need is a different approach. We need a policy which makes cooperation between both sides a central principle and which respects the sovereign right of the citizens in the partner countries to shape their future without outside interference. The content of the policy must focus on our common European challenges and transform partnership policy into a permanent tool for genuine cooperative discussions and for identifying solutions to joint problems. We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is taking a serious-minded and practical approach to the issue of the democratisation of European decision-making processes. As Mrs Giannakou’s report shows, this approach also involves the further development of European parties, which, although they have been an everyday political reality in Europe for many years, until now have not been equal partners and players in terms of their democratic influence on EU policy. We need political parties at EU level too that are firmly rooted in the societies they represent and that can play a strong role in the elections to the European Parliament and in establishing European openness, based on internal democratic structures and regulations. With regard to this particular report, I must say that I would have liked the rapporteur to have shown a great deal more courage by using the Parliament’s right of initiative to take a truly significant step in developing the political system and the party system in the European Union. This is a step that many citizens have been waiting for and that will encourage them to get involved. The interlocking European and national decision-making levels and the relations between the political parties could have been addressed more clearly as a common factor that is transparent and open to influence. The European Parliament should now decisively call on the Commission and Council to take the initiative in this regard. I would expect constructive cooperation from the Commission and Council.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate. However, I would like to mention two aspects. The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade. The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters. Therefore, my group will not support these amendments. Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology. This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers. We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important aspect of international trade policy very late in the day. Given its importance, I would have preferred the House to be full, with all the seats occupied. The European Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a major achievement of European trade policy. It opens up our market to the poorest countries in the world for all types of goods except arms. It also gives developing countries trade concessions on a whole range of products. GSP+ is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights, labour standards and protecting the environment. However, the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly. Over the years, the European Parliament, partner countries, companies and non-governmental organisations have made important suggestions for improving the system. The whole world is now waiting for the Commission to issue its proposal on the much-needed revision of the system. The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010. The Commission has not delivered on time and its failure to do so has left the countries involved and companies both inside and outside the EU in a dangerous state of uncertainty. The existing regulation must now be revised. You are attempting to rescue the situation by means of a transitional regulation and this is what we will be voting on tomorrow, that is on Thursday. The transitional regulation is simply an extension. It does not change anything, it does not improve anything and it does not implement the new requirements resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and, as the rapporteur, I have felt the same. It is the obligation of the Members of this Parliament to ensure that the rights, the duties and also the powers granted to the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe by the Treaty of Lisbon are respected. It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries. In order to protect the EU’s partners from the consequences of a long-drawn-out procedure, I suggested initially to the Committee on International Trade that only those elements of the regulation should be amended which are necessary to allow Parliament to fulfil its new role. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that I also believe a general redrafting of the GSP and GSP+ schemes is needed. During the intensive meetings with the Council and the Commission on the legal issues resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon which affect the transitional regulation, Parliament finally decided to take a big leap of faith. At this point, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to the chair of the Committee on International Trade, Professor Moreira, for his untiring efforts as mediator and also to you, Mr De Gucht, for the Commission’s assurance that key amendments, in particular with regard to informing and involving Parliament, would be addressed in practice. Therefore, we decided to drop all our amendments, in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible. We did this primarily in the interests of our partners and of the companies which are affected. The Commission’s assurance includes a promise in future to inform the European Parliament in full, immediately and at the same time as the Council about work relating to essential aspects of the GSP and about all developments and to share all documents relating to the GSP. The Commission also guarantees that the European Parliament will be notified about any suspension of preferences, in accordance with Article 16(3), about withdrawals, including the corresponding investigation reports from the Commission, in accordance with Article 17, and about safeguard decisions, in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, before they come into force. We welcome the tabling of Omnibus 1 and the Commission’s readiness to enter into an in-depth discussion of the proposals which it has made in Omnibus 1. At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently. Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation. We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament’s parliamentary rights. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for working together so constructively. Now that we have finally agreed on the formal aspects of the transitional regulation, I would like to make use of this debate to explain briefly some of the requirements for the future regulation. The new version of the regulation should have the following basic objectives: 1. To increase the efficiency of the system; 2. To develop rules that will provide for a better regulated reform process in which the involvement of the beneficiaries is guaranteed; 3. To ensure that the regulation gives due weight to the task of democratic control which Parliament is required to perform. This includes proposals from the Committee on Development. The new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) should be a clearer and more transparent system. I would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin. The rules of origin and the administrative procedures that accompany them are one of the main reasons why the trade preferences granted by the GSP are being underused, particularly by the least developed countries. In the current version of the system, the rules of origin often prevent preferences that exist on paper from having a positive impact. I have just come back from the Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva and this problem was very high up on the list of issues discussed there. In my opinion, the EU should campaign within the WTO for the preference system to be given priority as part of its work on harmonising the rules of origin. My second point concerns the partner countries. Here I feel that it is particularly important for us to develop more straightforward criteria. The Gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion. As already mentioned, we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively. My third point is about technical assistance. Preferences alone are not enough. We need to increase the impact of the system and improve the rate of utilisation of the GSP by providing technical assistance. This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole. I would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach. I will be happy to continue working with the Commission on the basis of today’s assurances. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, only last autumn, the European Parliament specifically welcomed the fact that the Heads of State or Government of the European Union had explicitly recognised, in a statement from the Madrid Summit, the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural resources and to control their use. The statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criteria. The summit was attended by Latin American countries, but the same laws apply to China and other states. The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) has led to serious environmental damage in China, as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere. This must not continue. We need an international agreement. China and other potential producers need our expertise and technology transfer in order to ensure that their mining processes are environmentally friendly and that their miners can work in much greater safety. China is also interested in investing in high-tech production facilities for processing REEs, because it does not just want to be a supplier of raw materials. The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here. A modern raw materials policy must be characterised by partnership. At the same time, you must put the emphasis on developing improved recycling and substitution technologies, because in future, the metals found in REEs will become even rarer: too rare simply to use them once.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement signed in October 2010, which has been assigned the attribute by the Commission and the Council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the EU and a highly industrialised state, the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98% in the next five years. The trade exchange between the EU and Korea is supposed to double in the medium term and that – so it is said – will speed up economic growth and the creation of jobs and prosperity. My group and I have justified doubts about this prediction. Quite apart from the mantra of the role of free trade as a kind of saviour of the global economy that is currently in a precarious state, which is also reflected in the Free Trade Agreement itself, it is not clear from this agreement whether it will, or will able to, help us deal with the global challenges arising as a result of climate change and the necessary fundamental economic restructuring. What are the efficiency criteria and what are the free trade criteria? At the same time, Commissioner, the Free Trade Agreement that has been concluded hardly contains any references to sustainability for the future, oriented change or international economic cooperation. An agreement is being concluded in which the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation are still being contravened. (The President cut off the speaker.) Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term. We plan to jointly allocate up to EUR 348 million to cooperation in areas such as science, academic exchanges – including Erasmus Mundus –, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy, as well as the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration should be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. The new aspect is that with what is known as ICI Plus, projects in developing countries can now also be financed – and specifically projects that do not fall under the general definition of development aid measures. These include projects and measures such as sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America – a completely new element. In the current times, when the EU has a greater responsibility to realign its cooperation in partnership with a growing number of states, allowing self-determined development has a particular part to play in this. The recast of the regulation needs to clearly mark the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It clearly states who can obtain financial assistance, for what purposes and on what terms. Another new element of this instrument is that the regulation specifies that the allocation of funding must ensure that the partner countries comply with the core working standards of the International Labour Organisation and that they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an important contribution to the international fight against climate change. Equally important, the rule of law and human dignity in work are elevated to cooperation objectives. As we are going into the second reading, allow me to restate that I consider it essential to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. In the plenary vote at first reading it was decided – albeit by a narrow majority – that none of the funds allocated to development aid thus far should be devoted to ICI Plus. We are going into the second reading with an accelerated rapprochement on this, as on all the financing instruments. Following successful compromise negotiations between Council and the European Parliament we have adapted ICI Plus to the challenges of the future. All the matters of substance have been approved by a majority in plenary. So far, so good – or so it would seem. However, it remains undecided how we will deal in future with the division of powers between the two legislative bodies of the EU resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly in the area of communitarised international trade policy. The issue at stake here is democracy, and specifically what are known as delegated acts – which is something on which the European Parliament and the Commission and Council continue to have differing views. What is this all about? We want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulations is in accordance with the spirit of the legislator. In the past the Commission has unfortunately too often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us a new role and duty as a legislator, and we demand a right of veto. The rapporteurs for the various foreign policy financing instruments, the chairs of the committees and the leaders of the groups are all agreed that we must fight for this democratic right. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conduct we have seen so far shows that not all three bodies of the European Union have yet recognised this principle. We are therefore vigorously defending our right of control today because in future the Commission must base its planning on what the legislator has laid down, not on its own communications. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, you are absolutely right that the outside world does not understand why we cannot come to an agreement with the Council. The Council is not even present for this debate, which I very much regret, because that is not a good omen for the completion of the second reading. However, we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right, which are enshrined in the treaty, are not being recognised. I believe, and Mr Brok has discussed this in detail, that this is only about giving us the opportunity to intervene. Perhaps I can give one more example with regard to the content. In the Commission’s multiannual plan for my industrialised countries instrument (ICI), the reference document was not the amended regulation, but instead the Global Europe strategy. This uses language which has become obsolete since the advent of the economic crisis and the resulting trade problems when it says that the objective of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. I can only repeat that this is not what the legislators intended the instrument to achieve and they have not put aside any taxpayers’ money for this purpose. In our view, the ICI should be a modern cooperation programme and not a weapon of conquest. To give another example, this time in more blunt terms: For us, the countries of south-east Asia are not just junior partners, as the Commission has stated. As part of the cooperation with central Asia, the instrument must not focus solely on EU access to the gas reserves there. When we look at the Maghreb region and the developments in the Middle East, it is clear that we need to take a long-term, large-scale approach to cooperation. I hope that the new regulation will be future-proof. I also hope that this financing instrument will encourage exchanges on an equal footing between the EU and third countries and will help to create openness throughout the world and promote responsible support for sustainable development processes which are in the interests of citizens.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my group has not signed up to the compromise resolution on Belarus. However, I would like to make it clear that this should not be seen as an acceptance on our part of the results of the election, the arrests and the reprisals against those with differing opinions. For us, fair, transparent and democratic elections – ‘the freedom of dissenters’ to quote Rosa Luxemburg – are a basic requirement for establishing a relationship with Belarus and with all other states. This also includes the immediate release of all political detainees. However, I doubt whether sanctions are really an effective means of bringing about the immediate release of political prisoners and radical changes in the democratic system in Belarus. Sanctions have had little effect in the past in Belarus and elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, you are as well aware of this as I am. A better approach seems to me to be to confront those who hold political power with our arguments and demands in the context of a political dialogue, not to give them the opportunity to discredit the criticisms made by those in civil society by referring to external criticism, to establish a transparent political system and to coordinate our efforts with those of all our foreign policy partners in Belarus. This also seems to be more honest in relation to our own arguments, as this morning’s discussion on the Hungarian Presidency has shown. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I have two brief comments on the report: firstly, I believe it is right and good that with this report the European Parliament is getting involved in the debate on economic and monetary union. After all, this is an issue of such importance that it cannot be left to the Council alone. To date, in the management of the crisis the Council has proven to be more a stronghold of nationalism than a place where European solutions are developed. Secondly, economic and monetary union is not sufficient. During the crisis many citizens viewed the work of the European Union, Parliament, the Commission and the Council as a means of supporting the banks. Whether that is true in all cases is a moot point, but that is the experience of many citizens: the banks are being supported, while the social situation of many citizens is becoming increasingly precarious. It is not sufficient simply to talk about prosperity, as the spokesperson for the Council did. What is required is a social union that guarantees all citizens social rights. If we do not manage to achieve this, the EU will lose the support of citizens. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank my colleagues for the good work they have done together, but especially Mr Ferber. This has really been a very good, fair and open collaboration. It is not always this way, so it is much appreciated in this case. At this point I would also like to thank the non-governmental organisations. They made a significant contribution, especially in the area of food speculation. What may not be obvious, and I want to emphasise this, is that the rapporteur has also engaged in the process. It has not always been easy and comfortable. I do believe, however, that at that point it was very important and good that the non-governmental organisations were involved in working on this area. This process opened up the dry, heavy issue of financial market regulation a little to some of the people, the citizens. It does Parliament good to let such an important issue get out of this House a little. I echo what Mr Giegold said earlier. We have taken an important and good step in the area of food speculation. However, there are still a few questions with regard to omissions – there may still be a few loopholes there. Nevertheless, this will be revealed by experience and then we will have to re-work this area. I think that what we have done on high-frequency trading is very deserving of support: I – and, I believe, the majority of my Group – can wholeheartedly support it. This is also not a matter of course, but on that point we have succeeded in creating something good and practical. On commissions, I can only echo what has already been said. It also seems to me to be a point in need of a little adjustment. However, this process is not so straightforward: tomorrow there will be further amendments proposed. Let us see what the result of that is. Jürgen Klute,

Madam President, first of all, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. I think that overall, the report establishes a good position for this House in this heated debate between Parliament and the Council. From my Group’s perspective, I would point out, first and foremost, that austerity policies in recent years have obviously failed and that countries which have run such policies and are under pressure to make savings have seen a loss of growth and tax revenue but also an increase in poverty and unemployment. Cuts in the MFF would mean the continuation and entrenchment of these policies for the next seven years, as a substantial proportion of the EU budget goes back to the Member States where it is used to support economic development, research and education. For that reason, we cannot and will not vote for such cuts in the MFF. Let me take an example from history. My country, the Federal Republic of Germany, faced a similar deep-seated crisis after the Second World War. Then in 1953, the London debt agreement was adopted, which not only cancelled Germany’s debts; it also, and above all, aimed to provide clear and tangible impetus for economic growth through programmes initiated under the Marshall Plan. This helped to bring Germany out of its post-war indebtedness and paved the way for its economy to develop in the way that it has. So our view is that we cannot make cuts: we must expand the budget and develop it further, and thus ensure that growth can help us overcome this crisis. I fully support Helga Trüpel’s detailed comments about own resources and the Financial Transaction Tax. We support this position too and would welcome rather more commitment from Parliament to moving forward on the question of own resources and implementation of the Financial Transaction Tax, as this is an important issue for this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Commissioner, I basically welcome your initiative for common banking supervision in Europe. I believe that is necessary. I have a couple of questions, however. The European landscape, the EU, is dotted with a wide variety of banks: savings banks, cooperative banks, private banks, big banks. I believe that we must maintain and protect this variety, even with European supervision. I believe this is very important because many of the small banks were stable throughout the crisis and should not be sent to the wall. Secondly, I would like to say that I do not believe that supervision alone will be enough. The supervisory body must also have effective instruments to enable it to intervene in the market as necessary, even removing toxic products from the market as required. Thirdly, and lastly, however good a bank supervisory body may be, it can still do little, with the legal situation as it currently is, with regard to the shadow bank sector. This means that we still need to remain aware of the fact that only part of the problem will be resolved with such bank supervision. The problem of the shadow banks will remain. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, on our agenda this week is a legislative own-initiative report on the subject of access to basic banking services. Parliament makes clear and detailed proposals from its perspective about what the Commission’s legislative initiative could and should look like. The first specific proposal concerns the schedule. A very large majority of the members of the main committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, believes that we should not waste any more time unnecessarily on this subject. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament by January 2013. I think that we are working along the same lines as Mr Barnier. We are of the opinion that the EU must make it possible for the 30 million citizens who have not yet had a bank account of their own to become part of the normal financial system. Without a bank account, things which the rest of us take for granted soon become insoluble problems. Renting a flat, signing a contract with an electricity supplier or joining the modern world of work are almost impossible in most countries unless you have a bank account. We believe that all of this should not be allowed to fail simply because the banks are aiming to maximise their profits. To quote the report: banks also have a responsibility for society. We will only have a functioning social market economy and a modern internal market when the banks genuinely take on this responsibility. However, let us be honest about the situation. Many citizens no longer trust the EU to achieve these goals. When it comes to the crunch, as it has in the current crisis, for the majority of citizens, these are just empty words. They know that the EU is supporting the banks with large rescue packages and many of them feel as if they have been left out in the cold. At least that is the impression that more and more citizens of more and more countries in the European Union have. The report which we will be voting on tomorrow was not originally planned as an own-initiative report. If the majority of the Commissioners had stuck to the Commission’s plan, today we would be able to present the citizens with the results of the negotiations. Work could already have begun on establishing the right of consumers throughout Europe to an account or these accounts could even be a reality already. We regard the recommendation that the Commission has sent to the Member States as disappointing. Many of the responses from the Member States to the request and to the Commission’s country reports are more akin to satire than to a sensible policy which is relevant to the citizens. In order to understand this, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. The question of access to bank accounts involves business interests, which is quite normal. These are interests which could hardly be more different as far as their opportunities for influence are concerned. Therefore, politicians must be responsible for ensuring a fair and socially desirable balance of interests. That is our job as politicians and as Members of Parliament. I cannot cover all the aspects of the report here. I simply want to highlight briefly what I believe are a few key points. One of these is cost. A basic account should be provided free of charge or at least at a reasonable charge. This is what the report says. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Member States should set a mandatory upper limit. The Commission should also investigate the possibility of an EU-wide upper limit for charges on a basic account, because we will not reach our target group without clear regulations on costs. Access is another important point. We must keep the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum for consumers who rely on a basic account. Financial exclusion goes hand in hand with social exclusion. Another key point is subsidiarity. A directive would enable us to take the individual features of each country into account. We believe that the Member States would be best placed to define potential exceptions if as many of the banks as possible were covered by the directive. Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the members of the negotiating team, to the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also to Mr Barnier for our very effective and constructive collaboration. This definitely made a major contribution to the success of the report. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like once again to thank everyone very much for supporting this report. This has been made very clear. Mr Barnier, you have heard that this initiative has broad support here in Parliament. I believe it is now time for the Commission to take action. We all know that you are very committed. No one doubts your commitment. However, we also know that there is opposition to this within the Commission. Please tell the College of Commissioners what you have heard here. You can be sure that you will have our broad support on this matter. It is true that there are one or two detailed issues that still need discussing, but I feel that we were able to work together very constructively across all the groups in the compromise negotiations. I am sure that we will find solutions for the specific issues which everyone will be happy with. Finally, I would like to say that I am looking forward to continuing to work together with everyone on this subject. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2010, the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States finally acknowledged that the European Community needs a more closely coordinated financial and economic policy. At the summit, they ‘invented’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed. An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy. It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘mini jobs’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight. I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea behind the ‘two-pack’ is to provide further rights of intervention in respect of crisis countries in the euro area. The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission’s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘six-pack’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday. Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘two-pack’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès’s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option. It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax is certainly not identical to the Tobin tax that has been talked about and debated for many years, but I think it incorporates essential elements of the Tobin tax. It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis. I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets. However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate. There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level. I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success. While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here. I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions. I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here. It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.

Well, in so doing, we are merely picking up on the tax that the City of London takes on derivatives, and even if we do not consider the tax rate to be sufficient, then that by no means suggests that we do not think this project is a good one. I see no contradiction there, and it would add something into the bargain if it corresponded to what has long been the practice in the City of London. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

– This FTT plan picks up on a number of elements of the Tobin tax which has been under discussion for many years now. It is an important signal to send to citizens, markets and banks following a series of campaigns and petitions aimed at introducing an FTT at EU level. Obviously, it could have gone further. It is not sufficient to stabilise financial markets and more needs to be done, but I urge the Council to follow the citizens and do everything possible to prevent this proposal from being blocked by Member States.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that in my opinion the sections in Ms Oomen-Ruijten’s report concerning the judiciary and constitutional reform are highly successful. I would like to congratulate her on these sections. However, I also believe that far too little attention has been paid to the subject of the situation of the Kurds in Turkey. As has been said several times, there are not only hundreds of journalists in prison, but also thousands of Kurds and in particular Kurdish politicians who are members of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). Some of them are elected members of parliament. This is not the way to resolve the conflict between the Turkish Government and the Kurds. It would be good to make our position on this subject clearer in the report. Together with some other Members, we have tabled amendments for tomorrow. I will be very pleased if there is majority support for these amendments. In my opinion, it will not help if we close our eyes to what is happening at this point. The EU must make itself clearly heard with regard to this issue. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what will the citizens of Europe think of the way in which we are handling the crisis after the last summit? They will realise that the banks are receiving around EUR 1 trillion from the European Central Bank (ECB) without any conditions being imposed on them. No strings are attached to this money and the banks can use it for whatever purpose they want. In contrast, the countries that are in crisis are being gagged and forced to introduce disastrous austerity measures. The citizens of the crisis countries are having to put up with cuts in their pay, pensions and social security benefits. However, unlike Germany, the economies of these crisis countries are not dependent on exports, but on their own internal markets. It is precisely these markets which are being destroyed by the austerity policies that have been imposed. This is not the right way to get out of the crisis, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy. In political terms, the EU is being driven into a brick wall. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, I would like to start with the positive aspects. I would like to emphasise that we welcome what Mr La Via’s report says on the subject of growth, which is that the focus must be on growth. We need growth that creates jobs and that can help combat youth unemployment. We think that this is very important. I would like to highlight the fact that we welcome the points relating to research and investment in research. However, I think we need clearer statements on fighting poverty within Europe and also in the world as a whole, on a global level. Moreover, the report did not look at how we are to combat climate change. I am very critical of the opening section of the report, which concerns automatic sanctions. I think that threatening the Member States with automatic sanctions is a mistake, given that they are already in a difficult situation with regard to their budgets. We are opposed to this. However, I want to highlight one point which I think is very sensible and that is increased coordination of the budgets of the Member States and the EU using a process which has democratic legitimacy. I would like to make one final remark on the subject of cutbacks. I want to emphasise that we do not believe that budget cuts are appropriate. We have already made it clear that Croatia will be joining the EU during the course of the year. We will have a whole series of new jobs to do in the EU and we have had new supervisory bodies in place now for more than a year. We need these bodies and we need funding and staff for them, so that they can work effectively and prevent future crises. This will ensure that the expenditure is a sensible investment which will help us to save money in future. In my opinion, these are the crucial points. Most importantly, we hope that we can work to ensure that there are no budget cuts. For us, that is essential. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday. The detailed regulations are also now available. What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified? Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem. A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however. I would say to the Commission that ‘cheap’ is not the same thing as ‘good’. It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners. Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story. I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed. That is nonsense. In the face of increasing world trade, Europe’s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink. Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade. We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level. In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly. Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions. However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources. As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear. A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries. Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States. The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU. Yet what does the Council do in this situation? It curtails the Commission’s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed. If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council. Jürgen Klute,

 Madam President, Mr Šemeta, I would like to make a few comments on the tax agreement between Germany and Switzerland, as other speakers have done. Instead of stopping tax evasion and blocking the loopholes for tax evaders, which would have been sensible, the result that has been produced here is a Swiss cheese full of large holes. The proposed transition period of five months gives tax evaders plenty of time to transfer their money from Switzerland to other tax havens. As foundations and trusts are not governed by the agreement, it is also possible to transform assets which have been stashed away in Switzerland into the assets of a foundation. Forms for doing this can be obtained from Swiss banks. Tax investigators in Germany have recently received information about a number of tax evaders who have hidden their assets away in Switzerland. The agreement gives these people an amnesty and the tax investigators can no longer use the information that has been made available to them. What sort of agreement is it that restricts the activities of tax investigators? An advertising video produced by Swiss banks says about this agreement that customers will benefit even more in future from the values of Switzerland as a financial centre. The agreement obviously not only lacks the necessary coordination at EU level, but also counteracts the efforts of the EU to bring more transparency into tax issues, to make the collection of tax in the Member States more efficient and, above all, to combat and to prevent tax fraud. Therefore, this agreement is, in our view, not acceptable. We are calling on the EU to oppose it, if there is any doubt. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Commissioner, for your answer which sounds very positive. However, I would like to emphasise once again that the problem lies in the fact that there was already a human rights clause in the old preferences scheme and it did not help to prevent the violations of human rights which took place under the Uribe government and before that. Therefore, my question was specifically: What exactly will be different? How do the EU and the Commission intend to guarantee in future that these violations of human rights will not be repeated? On the other hand, I have figures which show that under the new government in the last 300 days there have been more than 200 attacks on human rights activists. Also 15 leaders who supported human rights and the fair distribution of land in the agricultural sector have been murdered. When I look at what is happening, I have to ask once again: How exactly are you going to ensure that you can prevent this? I still do not know what the answer to this question is. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Goebbels has just set out very clearly the role that derivatives played in the financial crisis and what scale they possess. In view of this enormous scale, many citizens are calling for such financial products to be taken off the market altogether. We called for that too. However, we realise that such a small political group as ours has no chance of achieving a majority for this. We have to accept that, and we do. Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise once again that we thought it would be sensible to go further in this regard. On the other hand – and I say this to Mr Langen clearly and with respect – in our view the resulting report is acceptable and fair. Three important points from our perspective are the clearing obligation, the authorisation and monitoring of central counterparties and the reporting requirement for derivatives traders. These seem to us to provide an important and capable basic framework and a sound infrastructure that will enable us to arrive at a rational regulation. Moreover, this regulation is essential if we are to be able to levy a financial transaction tax – which is currently a subject of debate – on derivatives transactions. Although we have not succeeded in asserting all our demands, we believe that this report is absolutely worthy of our support. I would like to mention one more point that I considered to be particularly important: the reference to the problem of trading in food commodities and the associated speculation. We were only able to include this reference in the recitals; Mr Langen was prepared to do this. This point will come up again as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) progresses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, our party has already given this matter some consideration, but I do not have enough time to go into things to any degree right now. We do have some ideas for different ways of working with the financial markets, and how the things that derivatives are used for can, to some extent, be achieved by other means. It would take too long to explain all this at this juncture. However, I should be happy to provide you with more information in this connection. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session. Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple. The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated. As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these. The necessary translations were not available, either. We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009. However, the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table. For us, economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries. For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market. Naturally, for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets. None of this is to be found in the economic governance package. Instead, the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe. As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole. This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece, of Portugal and of Spain, but also those of northern European countries, back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe. The much-needed improvements on the Commission’s original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there – particularly in Mrs Ferreira’s report – have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council. In our view, the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable. As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with. This is reserved for the Commission. It bears little resemblance to democracy, and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future. In our view, the economic governance package – at least in its present form – is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing. That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not so much about individual people; it is, first and foremost, about a selection process. Surprisingly, anyone who searches for information on the selection process for the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Internet will essentially only discover that the United States and Europe share the two leading positions. That means that the economically strongest nations, as a minority, share control of the global economy among themselves, so to speak. That is feudalism and has nothing to do with democracy, and that is why we cannot accept this. In our view, Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepping down presents a major opportunity to make fundamental changes at this point to the nomination and selection process and to make it an open, transparent and, above all, merit- and qualification-based selection process, as some NGOs have been calling for recently. This should also include a combination of majority votes from the members of the IMF and a majority of voting shares in the IMF. Up to now, only the voting shares in the IMF have been taken into account, which ensures a structural majority for the economically strong nations. This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF. In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the core task of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is to promote the EU’s objectives through long-term financing of viable investments. This also means that the EIB is bound by the EU’s values; in other words, by social standards, transparency, high environmental standards, the development of a sustainable economy and the creation of jobs. However, we are hearing from NGOs involved in the local implementation of EIB-financed projects that it is by no means consistently ensured that these standards are met. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. The NGOs criticise the lack of transparency as regards the way in which loans are monitored across the EU and worldwide, how they are used and how they are reported on by the EIB’s financial intermediaries. To what extent is the EIB aware of these criticisms, and to what extent is the EIB actually looking into such criticisms? That is what we would like to know. From our point of view, at least some of what NGOs are calling for from the EIB is quite plausible: greater transparency as regards the granting of credit by financial intermediaries and the elaboration of clearer financing terms for financial intermediaries as well as efficiency criteria for the granting of loans. To improve transparency, NGOs further propose that environmental and financial information on EIB-financed projects be published before these are approved. In particular, EIB projects in third countries should be subjected to independent sustainability assessments in order to determine the economic, social and ecological impact of the project in question. However, there also appear to be other problems apart from transparency. Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental, social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs. Strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB’s financial operations. Projects that do not meet these standards should be excluded from support. Finally, I would like to make a comment on the subject of energy policy. It is pleasing that the promotion of a sustainable and safe energy supply is already one of the EIB’s current objectives. In view of the disaster involving the Fukushima reactor, the promotion of forward-looking, renewable, CO2
-free and nuclear-free energy production, as well as the promotion of energy efficiency in all areas in which the EIB invests, must be given the highest priority. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I think it is difficult to go into detail on this right now in view of the time available. However, I have a large number of reports from NGOs that I am happy to make available. I believe that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also familiar with these. These reports talk of how development aid is supported locally by the EIB in African and Asian countries and also make some criticisms of this. I am happy to make the reports available, but I cannot answer the question in detail right now. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I just wanted to provide a brief explanation. We have withdrawn Amendment 25, which related to the financial transaction tax.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the call for a financial transaction tax is nothing new; opponents of globalisation have been calling for such a tax for some years. Just five years ago, however, hardly anyone would have thought that it might be possible to implement it in the foreseeable future. Yet this week, it is on the agenda of the European Parliament alongside a CO2
 tax and Eurobonds, and rightly so in my opinion. I can only welcome and support the financial instruments proposed by Mrs Podimata in her report, and I believe they will be voted through. These instruments are urgently needed. So far, the consolidation of national budgets has concentrated solely on cuts in expenditure. However, cuts in public spending primarily impact workers, pensioners and the poor; in other words, those reliant on the welfare state. The income side of public financing has been completely disregarded to date. It is the second lever that we can use to consolidate national budgets. In particular, addressing the income side would result in the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis shouldering an appropriate part of the public debt. If we are to consolidate national budgets, then it is quite simply imperative that we increase tax revenues. In fact, the high level of public debt is mainly a result of the nationalisation of private debt; in other words, of governments taking on the debts of private banks and financing the consequences of the financial crisis. The states are thus in no way solely responsible for the debt crisis. Asking the financial sector to dip into its own pockets is therefore not simply obvious; it is our political duty. A financial transaction tax would at last mean this sector shouldering part of this debt as one of the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis. This report would send out an important political signal were it to be adopted as presented. Similarly, we consider Eurobonds to be a sensible and, thus, also a necessary instrument. They will do more to reduce debt than all the sanctions and advice put together, however well meant. The complaints by some countries in surplus that Eurobonds would increase their interest burden are unacceptable since, at the same time, these countries in surplus are earning more from their exports to deficit countries. Some might criticise this as a transfer union. However, anyone who wants a social Europe – who wants the EU to continue to hold together in the future – must accept the idea of a transfer union at least in principle. Finally, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope that it will now finally present proposals for a financial transaction tax; we have been calling for this for over a year now.

 Support for small and medium-sized enterprises will safeguard numerous jobs and strengthen the innovation potential of the European economy. It is therefore absolutely right to ensure the reasonable provision of loan capital for these enterprises, as only then can they make the necessary investments. However, the increase in venture capital called for by the European Parliament is to be rejected on principle. Instead of placing banks under an obligation to support the real economy by providing appropriate credit, Parliament is calling for it to be easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to get contributions from investment funds and private equity firms on the capital markets. With a motto of ‘locusts for everyone’, the motion for a resolution calls in places for private equity firms to make it easier to do business with them. This would turn smaller enterprises in particular into the pawns of investors to an even greater extent than they are now. These investors are very often on the look-out for absurdly high two-figure profits, which they can usually only achieve by carving up the acquired enterprises and selling them off bit by bit.

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do. There is therefore an urgent need for action. I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA. That is an important and positive step in the right direction. However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report. I would like to mention this once again. Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change. The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency. The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about. Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products. This, too, has come to nothing. I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation. I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience. Many people thought – and I would like to underline this fact again here – that the crisis in the euro area was over. Ireland shows that this is not the case. Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets. The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages. At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us. This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland – the star pupil – that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system – a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation. In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama. It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach. While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty. Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB. Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel’s simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet. If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air. Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I admit that that is difficult to assess. I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now. Undoubtedly, it is a tricky situation, but I think that things have now developed so far that a rethink might possibly take place. I am sorry, but I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that question. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, I would like to make two comments. The first is addressed to Mr Gauzès. I would like to thank him specifically for his excellent work and cooperation. However, I also found the cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs to be exceptionally good and constructive. I wanted to say that right at the start before I come to my points of criticism. I can, in principle, accept and reinforce what Mr Giegold has just said. I could have supported the first compromise that we agreed on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in May of this year. Indeed, I was able to go along with the decision. However, what has now been produced as a result of further negotiations is, also in the opinion of my group, no longer acceptable and we can no longer support it. As I see it, everyone is entitled to his own opinion on the matter, but in my view, the Council has played an unfortunate role here. I will express this a bit clearer than one or two others have done. In my view, the Council has missed an opportunity here. It gave in to a considerable extent to the financial market lobby and used everything in its power to prevent an effective regulation at European level. One morning, I received a call from a lobbyist, who said that if we really wanted to regulate private equities in this way, we would prevent development aid getting to Africa. A more absurd and obscure argument could not be found in this regard. These things have nothing to do with one another. Anyone who comes up with this sort of argument merely demonstrates the fact that he has no interest in meaningful and effective regulation. However, this is not the concern of Parliament. On behalf of Parliament – and I would like to emphasise this once again – Mr Gauzès and other fellow Members fought for an effective regulation. That was undermined by the Council. I want to say this once again; this is passive marketing. This is a point that Mr Giegold has already mentioned. It is like someone being prohibited from selling rotten eggs at the weekly market if he advertises them, but if he does not advertise the rotten eggs and just stands there and sells them, then it is evidently legitimate. However, it is no different to what has been laid down here in the section relating to passive marketing. It provides an opening. We have a European regulation – that has already been said and I think it is a good thing. However, when the door is wide open for it to be circumvented through loopholes, then the question arises as to how effective this European regulation really is. Private equities were originally regulated better. They are now relatively weakly regulated. A very important point – and here, too, I can only reinforce what Mr Giegold said – is the question of the information provided to the workforce. The original compromise stated that managers were obliged to inform their workforce of what they intended to do with the companies in which they had invested. What remains of this is the strained requirement for owners to inform their workforce and the works councils. You can imagine what will come of this – not very much. The Council has missed an opportunity here, and I hope that we will perhaps still be able to improve on it at a later date. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, economic governance as it is being developed here focuses solely on savings and competition policy. As has just been mentioned by the honourable Member from Spain, the problem of Germany’s orientation towards exports has not been addressed at all. Yet this is clearly a central problem, both in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole. German competition policy is being conducted to the detriment of internal demand in Germany. This is not being discussed at all. Above all, however, it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages. It is a wage battle – a wage competition. This wage competition is exerting enormous pressure on our neighbouring European countries, on European trade unions and on European workers. Neither the Commission nor the Feio report have addressed this problem. Any economic governance worthy of the name must take corrective action in this area rather than remaining silent. Jürgen Klute,

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank my fellow Members who have participated in rather tough and lengthy negotiations here. It is a tremendous achievement by the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs to have managed to do what they have done. They achieved the best result that it was possible to negotiate. Nevertheless, I do not want to hold back on the criticism that my group has, either. There are three points in particular that we are not happy about. On the one hand, the competences that have been granted to the supervisory authorities are, in our view, inadequate. We would have liked these competences to have been more extensive. We believe it is also wrong for the supervisory authorities to be split over several locations. We advocated combining them as far as possible in one location. That would certainly have made cooperation easier and more efficient. Mr Giegold has already mentioned that the staffing could, and should in fact, be improved in the long term. These are our main points of criticism. Nevertheless, we believe this to be a right and important step in the right direction, a right and important step towards a new regulation of the financial markets that is urgently needed. However – and this is simply our assessment – we still need to take some further steps in order to arrive at a truly effective new regulation of the financial markets, to get to a point where, through European regulations, we can prevent another crisis like the one we have just experienced. Our group will contribute greatly to this. There are, of course, a few more legislative initiatives on the way. We hope that these will bring more substance to this matter. If so, something truly effective and good could come of this. However, we really do still have a few more steps to take in this regard. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would just like to remind you that the rating agency Moody downgraded Greece again last night. We all know that the Greek Government has placed enormous pressure on its people in recent weeks, in order to get the crisis under control. We all know that the European Union has put together a package worth EUR 750 billion in order to support the countries that have found themselves in crisis and to help them out of it. Nevertheless, Greece has been downgraded. In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package. Mr Barnier, you have just used the metaphor of a thermometer and said that it must not be broken. I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies. A thermometer obviously does nothing to help improve the condition of the clients, the patient in question – which is something it just cannot do. After all, the thermometer is no drug and is obviously making the patient’s condition even worse. However, it is unacceptable that the countries which are making these efforts should end up being downgraded even further, despite everything they have done. This raises the question about what these rating agencies actually do. It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming. Therefore, rating agencies did not help predict or diagnose the crisis. Shortly before it collapsed, Lehman Brothers received quite a positive rating. So, with the methods they used, they were not able or did not want to recognise what we had in store. In that respect, this instrument has been a total failure. Nor have they helped us manage the crisis. I have just given you a newspaper quote on that: ‘Ratings have not helped improve the crisis situation despite all the efforts made and there is concern’ – as the media put it – ‘that we will not be able to see through the packages we have put together’. This means they will pull us down and downgrade us even further. To conclude, I would like to point out that countries and companies are just not comparable. We have to take a closer look at these ratings. Just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough. What we need is a root-and-branch reform of rating systems. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of this opportunity to take another look at the situation in Greece, because I believe that the crisis in Greece gives us an insight into the political status of the euro area. Firstly, however, I would like to make a remark about the calls from the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, to exclude Greece from the euro area, if necessary. My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, believes that this proposal is absolutely absurd. On the one hand, we are talking about a community with a common destiny. If we mean this seriously, then we cannot call, on the other hand, for a Member State to be excluded during the first large or moderate crisis that we have encountered. That is preposterous! Most importantly, this would be an admission of failure which would amount to kowtowing to the financial sector. The financial sector has shamelessly allowed itself to be bought out of the crisis by taxpayers, but we are now being asked to deny help of this kind to Greece. It will be difficult to explain to the pensioners and the workers in Greece and also in the other countries affected – according to the media, Portugal is the next country to come under scrutiny – why they are now being asked to pay up, having already supported the banks with their taxes. Taking this route would be the equivalent of driving the EU project into a wall. Despite all the justified criticism of Greece – and the Greek Members will realise that there is much to be done in their country – the crisis is by no means solely the responsibility of Greece. I would just like to point out that the majority of decisions on financial policy in the euro area have been handed over to the European Central Bank. The euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies. Major exporters such as Germany are forcing Greek economic policy to its knees. Therefore, this also represents a crisis in EU economic and competition policy. This is why we are calling for the ban on financial assistance for EU Member States to be lifted. The Member States in the euro area should make euro loans available, the European Central Bank should buy up debts in the same way that the Federal Service in the USA has done and credit default swaps should be banned. This is what we are calling for. (The President cut off the speaker) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to comment on two aspects of the Turkish issue. It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed, and rightly so. There is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain. However, what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in Turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights. The Turkish Government continues to oppose trade unions – in some circumstances even using the power of the police – which provide support for their members, in other words, for Turkish working people. This has happened recently in the dispute involving the Tekel workers. That is one of the comments that I would like to make. A democratic society must protect the rights of employees and trade unions and it is important to fight for these rights. The EU also supports these rights, in particular, in its role as a social European Union. The second factor is privatisation. Turkey is adapting to the EU and this includes the area of privatisation. The Tekel employees, of whom 12 000 are currently on strike, are threatened with the loss of their jobs or have already lost them as a result of privatisation. However, it is not only the Tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry. Around 500 000 people employed in growing tobacco in south-eastern Turkey have lost their jobs in recent years, with the result that, having been one of the major producers and exporters of tobacco, Turkey has now become an importer. A week ago, I had the chance to go to Ankara and speak with the Tekel employees. If the process of cutting jobs and destroying whole sectors of industry continues as a result of privatisation, the people of Turkey will lose their enthusiasm for accession to the EU. Therefore, we must put the focus on the social aspect of the EU. I would like to emphasise that once again. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years. Since the ban – we have only just heard about this – more than a thousand people have been arrested. I think that, in a country in which parties are routinely banned, it is no longer possible to talk of democracy. The prohibition of 27 Kurdish parties almost constitutes an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of Records. It is not only about the minorities in Turkey – and this is something that I would also like to mention again at this point. There is currently a strike being held by tobacco workers at the firm Tekel that is very intense and is now escalating. Several thousand workers went on hunger strike today in order to enforce their rights. They feel they have been severely oppressed by the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities. This aspect must be taken into account, because the protection of the rights of workers and trade unions is an integral part of democracy. The trade unions, but also the minorities, in Turkey are awaiting a clear and unambiguous opinion from this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the previous speakers. I would like to remind everyone that the Colombian President also attempted to extend his term of office in breach of current Colombian law and, therefore, this matter should also be taken up. Most importantly, however, I would like to highlight the fact that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation in Germany, a foundation which has close links with the German Free Democratic Party, was involved in the coup in Honduras. There was a debate about this at least in Germany. The foundation’s scholarship holders distanced themselves from this policy in an open letter. We must not forget that Mr van Baalen is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Friedrich-Naumann foundation, it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua. I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances – and this has not been contradicted – a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind. In all honesty, we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe. What is happening here is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discredit and publicly shame those countries, states and governments in Latin America which are trying to introduce more social policies. On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to say clearly once again that we will not support this. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament’s agenda many times. It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. That has been said a couple of times already. Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament. In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU. On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request. It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail. As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests. Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered? If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered? My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests? Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the world economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves cannot yet be foreseen. We have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force. What does the European Union do in this situation, where more and more people are threatened by poverty and unemployment and fear for their existence? The European Union decides on new focal areas in its budget. Or, to be more precise, it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders, in favour of hi-tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe’s citizens. Believe it or not, there is to be an increase of 16% for the area of freedom, security and justice. The fund to secure the external borders is to receive 12% more funding next year. The expenditure on strategic military security research is being almost doubled and will now rise to a total of EUR 215 million. From the point of view of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, this means that the EU is taking leave of its founding idea of being a peace project for Europe. This draft budget instead follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, with its obligation on the part of the Member States to constantly modernise their military apparatus and to secure the external borders. Europe’s Left instead demands that the European Union implement a consistent peace policy. Instead of an agency for armament, we call for a disarmament agency. Europe must concentrate its resources on civilian conflict resolution strategies such as a Europe-wide civilian peace corps and promoting independent research into peace and conflicts. In our view, this budget sets our sights increasingly on war instead of on crisis management and the Left in the European Parliament will not, therefore, support this budget. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council spring summit is traditionally devoted to discussing the economic and employment policies of the European Union, more recently in connection with the so-called European Semester. This year, however, the debate is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic situation in Greece. Greece is the ideal example on which to base a discussion about the failure of the economic and financial policies of the European Union. The predominant global policy of deregulation and privatisation has plunged the European Union into the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. As a result of this policy of deregulation, the global financial markets and also the commodity markets have got completely out of control or, more accurately, have fallen victim to speculators. The Greek crisis is also a result of EU policy, because the existing macro-economic imbalances between the Member States will be significantly exacerbated by the Europe 2020 strategy. These imbalances are what the financial speculators are now gambling on. It is not only Greece which is fighting for survival. A policy which has had such disastrous consequences in Greece and in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, needs fundamental changes. In fact, it must be reversed. Austerity measures are making the economic recession worse, as the fall in the gross domestic product figures of these countries has shown so dramatically. My group was strongly opposed to the Europe 2020 strategy and the imposition of one-sided austerity and debt reduction policies right from the outset. Instead, we need programmes to stimulate sustainable growth and to create jobs, together with programmes for investment, for the environment and for education. A policy which involves axing social services, abolishing social legislation and restricting fundamental democratic and parliamentary rights, while at the same time supporting the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, can only lead to outrage and social unrest. The Greek Government is losing its political base, the parties which belong to it are losing their members and the structure of society is collapsing. This is the result of Greek and European policy and it requires a fundamental change in the EU’s approach in favour of one which serves the interests of the people rather than those of the banks. One scenario could begin with the financial markets. Let us imagine that the European Central Bank (ECB) could lend money directly to the Member States via a public bank. This would enable the Member States to circumvent the international financial markets and to obtain the loans they need at favourable interest rates. No one could gamble on Greek, Portuguese or other bonds. All of the hype surrounding the markets would disappear. Does that sound appealing? All we need is the determination to take this step, and this is what my group is calling for. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the financial markets has led to developments on the markets that have not yet been brought under control. Only radical measures to prevent speculation on the markets will be able to put a definitive stop to the crisis. Instead of this, with the adoption of the Fiscal Compact Treaty we are seeing a further increase in the one-sided focus on austerity policy and the destruction of social cohesion. My group is strongly opposed to this radical approach of debt reduction and cuts in public budgets. It has even been criticised by the International Monetary Fund. The financial guru George Soros says that this austerity policy has thrown Europe into a deflationary spiral of debt. The debt brake was laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht and its adoption in national law is now intended to force its implementation. If that does not happen, the Member States are to be penalised with the help of the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union. That is absurd, and it is also undemocratic, as the Member States will lose their most important right: their budgetary sovereignty. Furthermore, it is totally unacceptable for the aid that is used to show solidarity with Member States which are in difficulty to be made conditional on signing up to the Fiscal Compact Treaty. This sacrifices the most important fundamental principle of the European Union on the altar of the financial markets. The Left will work to bring about a reversal of this disastrous policy. We need a pact for sustainable growth and employment. We need public programmes for investment in the environment and education and, above all, we need the European Parliament and the citizens to have a say. The Treaty must be approved by referendum or by public consultation. (Applause) Lothar Bisky  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, on October 30, our colleague Mr Meyer, a member of my group, was forcibly prevented from leaving the airport in the city of El-Aaiún in Western Sahara, receiving injuries from Moroccan security forces. The doctor diagnosed various contusions, problems with the neck muscles and dangerously high blood pressure as a consequence of the violence. This attack on a Member of the European Parliament is completely unacceptable. The President, the offices of the European Parliament and the national authorities have made representations to the Moroccan Government. So far there has been no response from Morocco. We cannot simply accept this without a word. I would ask for your solidarity. This outrageous incident is an opportunity for me to remind us all, yet again, that the people of Western Sahara have been suffering for decades as a result of the inability of politicians to bring about a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict. I believe that we can no longer remain silent. We should focus more on this issue in the second half of this electoral term. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the EU summit was supposed to bring about a breakthrough in the process of resolving the international financial crisis. It has undoubtedly not succeeded in doing so, because too many issues have been ignored and there has been a one-sided focus on reducing public debt and budgetary supervision. Even much of this was very unspecific. It may have given us a breathing space, but nothing more. The much-talked-about confidence of the markets cannot be regained by imposing an austerity policy based on the German model. The causes of the financial crisis are varied in nature, but the failure of independent bodies and, most importantly, the political system to manage or monitor the unregulated financial markets is the decisive factor. If we apply this standard, it is clear that the leading politicians of the 27 EU Member States once again did not want or were unable to take action. Increasing the financial power of the instruments which are intended to prevent speculation by bringing forward by one year the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) that amounts to EUR 500 billion, by continuing in parallel with the European Financial Stability Facility, and by extending the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with EUR 200 billion, will only guarantee that the banks will have their loans repaid and make a healthy profit on the interest. This is how the governments of the euro countries want to play the game with the financial markets, but they forget that they are in the weaker position. Most importantly, the failed attempt to leverage the rescue funds demonstrates the power and the powerlessness of the policy. The main opponent within the EU of regulating the international financial markets has gone into self-imposed isolation. Hopefully, decisive action will now be taken to tackle this problem, at least within the euro area and the EU Member States which want to join the euro. The first step must be to implement the international transaction tax quickly. Next, the most dangerous new financial products must simply be banned. This also applies to the activities of the shadow banks. The European Union can and must make progress and set an example in this area. If EU banks try to evade regulation in other parts of the world, they will be threatened with the removal of state rescue packages in the case of a crisis. Their business can ultimately be placed under state supervision or they can be nationalised. This would be an appropriate response to a systemic crisis. The consequences of the international crisis, which has been going on since 2008, are already unbearable for the vast majority of citizens. Young people’s plans for the future, provisions for the working population and the life’s work of millions of people have already been destroyed, with the most serious impact being felt, of course, in the crisis countries of Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. However, the citizens of all EU countries are affected by the excessive austerity measures. They are the culmination of the neoliberal policy of deregulation and privatisation and the redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top. This policy over the last 15 years is what has taken us into the crisis and, therefore, it must be stopped and reversed. We can only ensure that public interests are served and that the welfare state is maintained by restraining blind market forces. Austerity measures will not stimulate growth and will not lead us out of the crisis. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, the crisis merry-go-round is turning faster and faster and more and more euro countries are being pulled aboard. Even the countries with the best triple A ratings, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, are feeling the adverse effects caused by the financial markets, which are playing cat and mouse with the euro countries. All the measures that we have adopted so far to regulate them have had hardly any effect. We can therefore legitimately ask whether it is time to change the rules of the game. However, the decision on this needs to be made by the EU institutions and not by means of intergovernmental agreements, such as those envisaged by Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy. The vicious circle of downgrades to countries’ ratings and rising interest rates has to be stopped. Therefore, we are making a decisive call for the evaluation of sovereign states by private rating agencies to be qualified and for the creation of an independent European agency. In addition, the European Central Bank must be allowed to buy bonds without restrictions. Ms Merkel seems to be ready to exchange her resistance to this for closer supervision of the budgets of individual countries and automatic sanctions. However, this involves allowing intervention in the sovereignty rights of individual states, in this case budgetary rights, which means that the inherent rights of national parliaments will be disregarded. In future, the Commission aims to be able to force countries to make social security cuts, lengthen working hours and increase the retirement age. I can only warn against implementing this policy. The results in Germany show that it puts a very one-sided burden on the majority of the population. Consequently, the social divide will become even wider. The low-wage sector now covers 20% of all working people. More and more people are finding themselves living in poverty in their old age. By contrast, a few rich people are becoming even wealthier. As a result of this policy, social equality is no longer functioning and society is threatened with collapse. I am opposed to a future of this kind for the European Union. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, as the example of Italy shows, where risk premiums for government bonds exceeded the critical mark of 7% for a while, the markets are relatively unimpressed by the decisions of the most recent European summit. The next euro area country is already in their sights. The increase in rates in Italy since October is not based on any trends in the real economy, and as the experiences of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain in similar situations show, concentrated remedial measures from the EU and the IMF and the use of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) appear inescapable. That clearly shows that the measures we have adopted so far to regulate the financial markets do not fully take effect. I fear that, even with the new plans to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area, this will not significantly change. When I think of the package of European Commission measures that you have announced, President Barroso, with the five proposals for increased economic policy coordination, I cannot see the answer to the main question, namely do you have the courage and the ability to regulate the players on the international financial markets in such a way that, in future, speculative activity could be excluded as far as possible? Ecofin’s discussions on the financial transaction tax demonstrate that there is no political will in the Member States even for small steps. The finance ministers continue to answer global challenges with national thinking and proposed solutions based on the interests of their national banks. How big does this crisis have to get, how many countries need to be mired in it, and how big must the sacrifices of the populaces of the countries affected be before people see that we need to act? You propose, for example, issuing a Green Paper on Euro Stability Bonds. Much as I stress the necessity to introduce Eurobonds, I am astounded by the method. How long do you want to spend talking about the necessary minutiae of the shape to be taken by the mechanism? What effect will the time spent on the discussion process have on the markets? For me, these are the crucial questions. Instead, the monitoring of the budgets of individual countries is to be tightened up again. It is as if you believed that forcing austerity measures would trigger growth. In reality, however, the most pressing issue is the need for specific measures to improve growth and employment, with the resultant income and thus domestic demand. The austerity measures put in place in the crisis only serve to deepen it. The key economic figures for Greece, Portugal and Ireland for 2010 and 2011 surely show this. There is one question that, it seems to me, has not been given sufficient consideration, namely how can additional sources of finance be unlocked for these Member States? Their Government revenues need to be increased. Up to now, we have only heard proposals to cut social security payments, wages and pensions, or to increase VAT. The result of this is to stifle consumption by the mass of the population, and the fairness gap between the rich and the poor could become even larger. The citizens, too, can feel this. They do not see themselves as responsible for this crisis, and they are right. They are calling for social equality, including fair taxation. That is why there are mass protests in the Member States where austerity packages have been imposed. That is why there is political instability in the crisis countries, where numerous governments have already been swept aside. If the austerity course were to be made worse, the protests would also grow further. Where does that lead us? It strikes me that there is a complete lack of taxing the banks, the big corporations and the rich in the Member States. They could make a greater contribution to overcoming the crisis without difficulty. Tangible steps in this direction are required. That would give the citizens the feeling that the pain was being shared more fairly. However, that policy direction must also come from you, from the Commission, the Council, the Euro Group and other international institutions. It has been shown, after all, that the neoliberal mantra of tax cuts and reducing the regulation of market forces led to such terrible distortions that the entire global financial system is in jeopardy. A reorientation of thinking and approach is required here. We need a ban on short-term trading of credit default swaps, on short selling and of other high risk financial products. That is the order of the day. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were promised a bold move that would constitute a comprehensive solution to overcome the debt crisis. But what has the summit actually achieved? The Greek debt crisis has entered a new phase with the agreed haircut of 50%. This is something to be welcomed because it means that the country is freed from a significant part of its national debt. This is a positive outward signal and eases the situation for the Greek Government. This step does not mean a reversal in the downward spiral of the Greek economy, however. According to expert assessments, the country’s financial needs up to 2020 have already risen to EUR 250 billion. Likewise, this has not reduced the disastrous consequences for the people of Greece. In particular, the Greek banks need to survive the consequences of the haircut. They need extensive supports if they are to be rescued from ruin, otherwise it is not just the bond holders who will bear the cost, but also countless Greek citizens with their savings, pensions and other insurance cover. Much as I welcome the fact that the main culprits for the debt crisis are being called to greater account, this may be a risky move, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and for many ordinary savers. What assets will be levied by the banks? I believe that a socially just solution can more probably be achieved with nationalised banks, although a rescue or capitalisation of the banks should be made conditional on direct consultation or even more effective controls by the state. Banks in these countries should be recapitalised to the same extent as banks in France, Germany and other countries. The question remains whether the haircut will bring the much-vaunted lasting solution for Greece and the other endangered countries. Will this restore the trust of citizens and investors in the international financial markets? This is a question that I can only answer by quoting a famous phrase from Faust: ‘While I have heard the message– about the summit – I am not sure I believe it.’ When I think of the general strike and the further mobilisation of the public, I know that the Greek people have lost confidence massively. What is more, democracy itself is in huge danger, after all a government can only act against the opinion of the majority of the population for so long. This is a question that must also be answered by the IMF, ECB and the Council, in other words the so-called Troika, which has placed Greece under this austerity regime. My doubts also relate to the financial trick of leveraging the rescue fund. Although this will mobilise more financial resources, the question is at what cost? Countries are playing according to the rules of the financial markets and believe themselves to be in a strong position. If you will permit me, this is an illusion. The state debt crisis may not just spread very rapidly, but may also require massively increased commitments. This increases the risk to the taxpayer several fold. We must act decisively in bringing the power of the international financial community to heel, otherwise the crisis will spread. Everything is to play for. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of the crisis is becoming less and less transparent and more and more chaotic. The Council is starting to introduce pre-summits and main summits within the space of three days. Parliament is following the same rhythm and debating the results of the Council discussions twice during one part-session. It is already becoming clear that the big step forward that has been promised will not be happening on this occasion either. The only thing left to say is that the Council and the Commission are continuing to work on the principle of hope: hope that the new measures will generate sufficient confidence and that the investors on the international financial markets will be satisfied this time around. Why should they stop betting on future state bankruptcies? Why should they not try to draw Spain and Italy into the maelstrom of speculation? Only radical measures to prevent profitable speculation can stop this from happening. Until we bring in measures of this kind, the carousel will continue to turn and the Council will continue to propose rescue packages based on taxpayers’ money. The suggestion now is to use financial engineering tricks to leverage the agreed funding of EUR 87 billion for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). One German economist has referred in this context to a weapon of mass destruction, because the states which are showing signs of weakness require financing to the tune of EUR 4 trillion. The proposed haircut for Greece is inevitable. The only question is: who will bear the cost of it? Of course, it is right that the international banks should take on a greater share of up to 60%. However, it is important for us to prevent bankruptcies. This affects Greek banks in particular, whose very existence is under threat. After all the cuts in social security spending, do the Greek citizens now have to worry about the safety of their savings and bank deposits? Instead of a rescue package for the banks, we need a rescue package for wages, salaries, pensions and citizens’ savings. We need a public bank in the European Union which provides states with the necessary loans at favourable interest rates and excludes the private banks. We need public investment programmes to create jobs and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, since the last debates on the state of the European Union here in Parliament, the situation has come to a head. I would like to say that none of the proposals have been taken up and implemented. I recognise that the situation has become rather critical. That is perhaps our problem. We are a long way from a comprehensive solution. It seems as if the players on the financial markets are just telling themselves that they do not need to take all this very seriously and that they will just carry on regardless – and they are carrying on regardless. They are cheerfully betting on the interest rates for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds, while the credit rating agencies, which are caught in a conflict of interests, are fanning the flames by reducing the credit rating of Spain and Italy. Greater attention is now turning to those European banks, whose undercapitalisation poses a growing risk, as demonstrated by the Dexia bank, for example. The people of Greece, Portugal and Spain are organising mass protests against the drastic measures to reduce public expenditure. Unemployment, the situation among young people and the austerity measures are mostly burdening citizens rather than those who have caused the crisis, namely, the players on the unregulated financial markets. In our Member States, there is an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions of Europe. This week, marchers from Spain, the indignados
, are here in Brussels. They want to give expression to their protest against the consequences of the policy of privatisation and liberalisation, which has led to the excesses of the markets. This movement of dissatisfied people encompasses all of those countries that are placing the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people. The clear failure of neoliberal policy affects not only the financial markets; it is clear here that speculating on rising and falling prices has long since reached other areas, for example, the global agricultural market and the commodities markets. The functioning of the real economy itself is at risk, because only a few large international companies can cope in a financially sensible way with the extreme fluctuations. Although we talk about it frequently, we have ended up in a hare and tortoise situation in which the market participants, representing the tortoise, proudly proclaim ‘I am already here’. I believe that if we want to take ourselves seriously, we need to ensure that we also discuss the follow-up to the debates. I would say that, in my opinion, nothing of any consequence has changed. If the sensible proposals that have been put forward here, including by Mr Barroso, cannot be put into practice, then the situation really is desperate. That is the crucial point of criticism that I would like to express. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Union is undergoing its most serious crisis since it was first founded. This is something that we definitely all agree on. It is, of course, all about the economic, financial and debt crisis, about Greece and about the euro. The Member States and the European Union have not put in place sufficiently effective regulation of the financial markets. As a result, the policy is likely to end up at the mercy of the speculators. The measures which have been taken so far are aimed at budgetary consolidation by means of cutting spending. In concrete terms this primarily means reducing social security budgets. It means cuts in salaries and benefits, rising unemployment, falling public investment and a drop in real economic growth. More and more decisions are being taken on an intergovernmental basis without prior agreement with parliaments, but instead in agreement with bank bosses. As a result, the European Union is increasingly losing confidence and support. The eurosceptics are gaining ground and that is a fact. The European Union is in the midst of a crisis of political credibility. I believe that we are all of the same opinion in this respect. Mr Barroso, we do not entirely agree either on the analysis of the causes of the crisis or on the best ways of resolving it. Despite the need for criticism, I would like to emphasise that we on the left are aware of our responsibility for the European Union. The idea of European unity is a left-wing idea which has been defended by many left-wingers past and present. We will continue to defend this idea in the future and we will make sure that it is not surrendered to the profit interests of the markets and the speculators. I am convinced that Europe needs much more cooperation, rather than a further withdrawal into national interest. Europe needs a jointly coordinated, democratically legitimate, economic, fiscal and social policy based on solidarity. Therefore, we will support you, Mr Barroso, when you finally present the promised legislative proposals, which have been called for by Parliament, as the first steps towards comprehensive regulation of the financial markets, taxation of financial market transactions and Eurobonds in order to reaffirm the principle of solidarity in the European Union. We will continue to emphasise the value of solidarity between states and between people and the urgent need for it. Solidarity does not just involve financial aid. It also involves resisting the governments’ mania for austerity measures. As the main representative of a genuine European institution, you should be able to support our call for a step back from this culture of austerity. The fact that the social divide within society is growing much wider also seems ominous to me. The politicians are focusing on saving the banks and making available credit facilities of hundreds of billions of euros. However, the ordinary people are being left to pick up the tab for the failed policy of deregulation and privatisation. Huge austerity programmes are being imposed on them, they have to work longer hours and their wages and benefits are being cut. They are at the mercy of the governments’ austerity programmes. Social justice is simply being trampled underfoot and we cannot go on like this. The mass demonstrations in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are making this quite clear. Finally, I would like to say that either we will take a joint route out of the crisis based on solidarity, which will allow the EU to emerge from the crisis in a better, more social, more sustainable and even more democratic form, or there will be no solution for the EU as a whole, with damaging after-effects that are hard to predict.

 Mr President, it is true that this is a different problem. However, I would like to make it quite clear where I believe the risks lie. I think I have explained that. We will not solve any of the problems of the 21st century by withdrawing to the level of the nation states. (Applause)
 This is why I am also defending the Community method. That is what I wanted to explain. Otherwise we need, of course, to differentiate clearly between all these things. However, the basis must be that the countries of Europe can come to a solution together. That is why the European Union exists. As individual countries they will not achieve anything and will slide back into the Middle Ages. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, tomorrow, this House will vote on the tightening up and expansion of the Stability Pact. If the package of measures goes through as negotiated, then public borrowing will be penalised in practical terms. The Member States will have to introduce extreme cuts and savings. My group believes that this is the wrong approach, however that is not important right now. My question to you is: what do you think needs to be done to improve revenue for the Member States? Do we not need urgent measures to bring to an end the ruinous race to reduce taxes in Europe with minimum tax rates for business profits and high incomes? Lothar Bisky,

I have a supplementary question. We believe that the European Central Bank is taking the right and responsible course by holding down interest rates for endangered EU States by buying up government bonds. Should we not finally abolish this taboo and approve the purchase of government bonds – provided, above all, that such purchases are subject to clear and transparent rules? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of the so-called crisis summits have produced solutions to the debt crisis and to the uncontrolled speculation. State aid is still being given to the banks and austerity measures are hitting the poorest people and the middle class hardest, particularly in the debt crisis countries, but also in Germany. This weakens overall economic demand, investment and social cohesion within the European Union. Despite many announcements, we have not succeeded in putting in place comprehensive regulations governing the financial markets. The citizens of Europe and the markets themselves obviously have doubts about the economic competence and the ability to act of those in power and of the EU institutions. I must make it clear right from the beginning that none of this pleases me. I agree with those Members who proposed that the EU constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon, should be revised. Before the treaty came into force, my group had already pointed out that it does not meet the current social, democratic and economic requirements and challenges. Please allow me to make a brief remark about the EU budget for 2012 and the medium-term financial plan, which we will soon be discussing. The more cuts we make, the less funding will be available for cohesion and structural policy, for supporting cultural institutions and for exchange programmes in the fields of education and research. However, it is precisely these policies which represent the added value offered by the EU, which allow the citizens of Europe to experience the EU at first hand and which represent the first moves towards a social union. In my opinion, anyone who calls this into question is putting the idea of the European Union at risk. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, the Polish Presidency may be able to offer some ray of hope in a time of crisis when there is little enthusiasm for Europe. A clear majority of the Polish people are positively disposed towards the EU, far more so than in many other countries. I very much welcome the openness promised in the Presidency’s programme, which includes better relations with our neighbouring states of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. As Poland’s western neighbour, Germany has had some positive experiences in relation to cooperation between regions close to national borders. There is a wide range of political challenges that we are all facing. In relation to the decisions on economic governance, we need more open, respectful cooperation between the EU institutions, in particular, between the Council and Parliament. In terms of substance, I can only reiterate that we need to start rescuing people, not just the banks. Let me say something on the reform of the EU budget. I do not believe that the budget can realistically be frozen for the medium term. Populist slogans like ‘It is time for the EU to tighten its belt’ clearly miss the point. In this time of crisis, the EU can and must demonstrate its added value by acting as an effective community based on solidarity and that is how I interpreted your speech. I believe that there is room for improvement in the agenda in relation to energy and climate policy. A new global agreement on climate change to follow on from the Kyoto Protocol will have to be reached in the coming months. The European Union must not slow this process down. I wish the Polish Presidency every success. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something. Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece. However, everything is just continuing as before. Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded. At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States. The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model. Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things. However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets. The consequences can still be felt today. I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however. Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks. In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told. In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop. Things will just carry on as before. The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy. However, we lack the courage to do this. The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with. That is where the problem lies. We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors. This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground. I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be ‘let us carry on as before’. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years. I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs. Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process. Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges. As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe. Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer. I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts. At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system. In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand. This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed. Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation. I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr Barroso, I have just one brief question. I am pleased that the G8 summit and the e-G8 forum that preceded it discussed the Internet. There are also concerns about why those with power are concerning themselves with the Internet. We are aware of how sensitive this area is. Is there any more you can tell us in this connection? Is this a one-off, or will there be further discussion? Will you be putting this on the agenda again? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 My curiosity is still somewhat unsated on this issue and I would like to ask you if you would be prepared to tell us, in general terms, about these further negotiations concerning the Internet, as this is an important and far-reaching measure for the future. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism. To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours. The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this? With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy? It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests. However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past. The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests. The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms. The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya. Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there. What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur? How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity? My group is particularly concerned with this question. The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common. They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations. The EU must respond to this demand. In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, my Group finds the results of the Council meeting inadequate. Firstly, let us consider economic policy. We have articulated our thoughts on the agreed guidelines in the area of economic policy in a hearing held last week. What we need is to overcome the neo-liberal practice of profit and competition fixing, evident in terms such as ‘flexicurity’, adjustment of retirement age, and so on. We believe that there is a need for democratically legitimised, controlled economic policy management that will prevent tax, wage and environmental dumping practices through appropriate common minimum standards that will provide effective regulation for the financial markets and prohibit the privatisation of profits, while at the same time passing on the risks to the public at large. My second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and Libya in particular. The EU Member States have become involved in a macabre situation in North Africa, particularly in Libya. We have already heard some criticism here. I would just like to emphasise one point: the dictator Gaddafi is using weapons purchased from us against the demonstrators and rebels. He is under fire from NATO troops apparently in order to protect those fighting for freedom and democracy, who are also using European and US weaponry. I would like to know the point of the existing code of honour in relation to arms dealing if such a situation can exist? Where is the support for freedom, human rights and the fight against social injustice in specific cases such as Lampedusa, where hundreds of refugees are arriving from North Africa every day? I fear that the newly cobbled together neighbourhood concept is more about European interests than an appropriate response to the needs of the partner countries. My third point relates to Japan. We still have time to discuss Japan this afternoon and tomorrow. Here too we fail to recognise a coherent European approach, at least as far as safety controls, the so-called stress tests, are concerned. I am not surprised that our citizens are asking with justified scepticism what exactly the European Union’s position is on this issue. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
My question is similar to that of Mr Schulz. For this reason I intend to focus on a particular aspect. Naturally you will understand that, in the light of our experiences with the bank stress tests, we have become more sensitive about stress tests, including those relating to nuclear power. My question relates to Euratom. I do not wish to sit as judge and jury on the huge sums of money that Euratom swallows up on research. In my personal opinion, this research funding is being spent on a technology riddled with risk. I do not believe these risks are subject to adequate common controls, nor do I believe that there is sufficient scope for joint decision-making on this issue. After all, nuclear power does not respect national borders. That is precisely where the problem lies. Is it not the case that decisions on nuclear power should be taken on a joint basis because radiation recognises no boundaries? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, what would you think of the idea of establishing a European institution for promoting renewable energies, for the environmentally sensitive provision of energy and for energy savings within the framework of the EU Treaty? Do you think this proposal would be worthy of your support as it could rid us of the risks of nuclear power more quickly? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union without effective coordination of economic policy will not work. The Stability and Growth Pact has failed – on this many experts across party-political boundaries are agreed. The problem is that politics does not seem to have made much progress. In fact, no new political concepts are in sight. Let me remind you that the stability pact’s 3% limit has been breached 73 times since 1999, 46 times in a way that is barely tolerable under the Treaty – yet in not one single case has a penalty been imposed. This non-functioning pact does not need to be revised; it simply needs to be implemented more – or rather, it needs to be implemented in the first place. Naturally, every householder and every entrepreneur knows how important it is to have sustainable budgets. However, I fear that in the forthcoming decisions on economic governance and on the European Stability Mechanism it will be all about cuts. That is not the same as a sustainable budget. No state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates. However much it saves, its debt will continue to rise – all the more so if wages, unemployment benefit and pensions have to be reduced, working hours extended, and public investment in infrastructure, education, health and so on cut back. If there is no consumption, then production will also collapse. Neither tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact nor the so-called strict conditionality of the future stability mechanism will therefore lead us to our goal. What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis-hit countries in particular, and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates. The mention of the necessity of reducing macro-economic imbalances will be problematic for so long as it is only demanded of economically weak states, while those that are economically strong are allowed to continue as before. Not only does the key word ‘solidarity’ not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, I find it remarkable that unease now reigns in the majority of the groups in this House in respect of approving the use of a fast-track procedure for the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This report clearly confirms our expectation as MEPs that any future crisis-management mechanism will not create parallel structures outside the Union and that parliamentary democratic supervision should be maintained at every stage. It is just that I find myself somewhat lacking in belief in this regard. Mr Barroso did make clear yesterday that he supports both the goal of social cohesion within the Union and the Community method. All the speakers agreed with him. Thus far, however, this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that, it strikes me, is something lacking. What there was – or not – was the Merkel-Sarkozy pact. That awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism. For my group, it is clear that we cannot give our approval to any policy that aims to consolidate the budget by means of further cuts in the social sphere. The European Parliament must first be given a vote on the specific proposals for the Union’s future economic and monetary policy and the related mechanisms, as these are what this is about at its core. That, in turn, is such a fundamental decision that it must not be taken on the basis of ‘Europe by decree’ but only in accordance with the convention method laid down by the Treaty. My group is thus unable to vote in favour of what is, in many respects, a positive report. Ultimately, despite constant assertions to the contrary, this would, of course, set a precedent. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Barroso, I was pleased to note that you have appreciated the social dimension of this issue and have supported a social settlement. This will certainly be necessary. There is no need to repeat much of what my fellow Members have said as I am in complete agreement with them. I am extremely sceptical of the pact that has been presented by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. Why is this? Because their reasons for presenting it are not very clear. The fact that it has no validity is quite a different issue. They are both clever strategists. I cannot accept their claim that things simply happened this way. I believe that they mean things precisely as stated there. This is the point I would like to return to once again. I believe that this is a very serious issue. Although they believe that this clause on the indexation of wages and salaries is the right answer, I am not so sure. In black and white terms, increasing the pensionable age can also be described as a reduction in pensions. It will be extremely hard to reduce debt. After all, even countries like Germany find this very difficult. I can imagine that Ireland or Greece will find themselves in huge difficulty here. I am a little sceptical about what the proposed solution is supposed to achieve. I expect transparency in this matter. You will receive support from Parliament if you play your part in promoting greater transparency and ensuring that games like this are not played out behind Parliament’s back. If these people want to make social security cuts, they need say so clearly, rather than taking countless detours to reach an objective that you, Mr Barroso, do not share and that we certainly do not share. We are prepared to discuss the concept of coordinated European economic governance with you provided that this economic governance is worthy of the name, in other words, that it is democratic in structure and that it will help establish a sustainable, socially responsible European community. We are also willing to discuss amendments to the Treaty, for example, in relation to a social progress clause. However, we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation. This is the only way that Parliament can monitor this process. It cannot be done without information! Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, Mrs Harms mentioned something important yesterday. Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations. One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis. Quite the contrary – it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place. It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact. This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms. In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens. It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts. Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible – all of this means wage restraint and cuts. It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society. In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt. It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey. This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support. However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy. Yesterday’s debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point. We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century. Nobody wants that. Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has only been in existence for a short time. However, it is now going to be modified for the second time in just a few months because of what is alleged to be an urgent matter. As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure. We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament. Now the Council is once again under time pressure and many Heads of Government want the new Treaty modification to be implemented using the supposedly tried and tested fast-track procedure. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left opposes this approach, which is threatening to become a standard process, and is calling for Treaty modifications to be managed using the normal procedure, including the convention, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make some brief remarks about the media law. Many speakers have mentioned this, but I will not repeat what they have said. I would just like to make one point. This is not interference in Hungarian affairs. I believe, and I have only learnt this late in life, that the media are responsible for monitoring those in power and the economy. This situation must remain unchanged. Therefore, the media must not be monitored themselves by other higher level bodies and a media authority of this kind would make this possible. For this reason, the composition of the media authority is, in our eyes, not ideal. You have clearly stated that you are prepared to change this and I hope that you do move in this direction. Otherwise, and I would like to make this quite clear, it is a Hungarian affair. Of course, there are other Member States whose media legislation we could mention in this context. This does not only relate to Hungary. I would like to say quite clearly with regard to your plans for the Council Presidency, firstly, that I welcome the fact that you have made promoting cultural diversity one of your overriding objectives. I believe that this is very important. I look forward to your initiatives to improve integration, including the integration of minorities, and you yourself have referred to the Roma. A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue. Secondly, I am pleased to see that you are committed to the enlargement negotiations and the policy with regard to our eastern neighbours. Bringing more Eastern European culture, together with the historical and social experience of the area, into the European Union can only be a good thing. For many reasons which I do not want to go into here, the European Union is still primarily a Western European institution. I would like to see your Council Presidency exerting a greater Eastern European influence. Thirdly, I will be interested to see how you handle the forthcoming reorganisation of agriculture and cohesion policy and the preparation of the European Union’s multiannual budgetary perspective. My group calls on you to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in all of this and we expect you take seriously your promise to support small and medium-sized businesses and to improve environmental protection, the sustainable use of resources and food security. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr Barroso, we are all aware of how important the stability of the euro is. That being the case, there is one event that I found myself not quite able to understand. This was the debate about the increase for the rescue package, where you gave the green light but Chancellor Merkel gave the red one. My question, therefore, is whether you do not coordinate with one another at all. I appreciate that such things do happen sometimes, but this is not the first time that I have come across or heard about something like this. The media have taken a great interest in this in the meantime. Yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and Chancellor Merkel. It is an important political issue. I can understand that – believe me, I do not always see eye to eye with the Chancellor, either – but the issue concerns whether such publicly differing opinions do not help the financial speculators. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion, and the report. My question remains, however – on such an important issue, where the euro is being speculated on, at a point in time as important as this one, how can it be that your opinion comes across as uncoordinated with Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy or other Heads of Government? That is the public perception, in any case. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been dealing with the global economic and financial crisis for three years now. One of the conclusions to be drawn from this long-lasting discussion is that our measures are obviously not tackling the roots of the crisis, but simply treating the symptoms. I would like to repeat once again that decisions at EU level must not be determined by the financial markets. We must not allow the banks to get away largely scot-free, to continue speculating and to leave the Member States to take responsibility for the risky transactions that the banks have entered into. The tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause. This will restrict consumer spending and prevent the necessary economic upturn from taking place. Drastic savings measures will put other countries that are currently at risk, such as Portugal and Spain, in the same position as Greece and Ireland. Simply readjusting the financial instruments or putting new safety nets in place will not help. A permanent mechanism for preserving financial stability must include measures which regulate the activities of the markets. These include, among other things, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards. It is also important for us to change the statute of the European Central Bank to allow it to provide direct financial aid for ailing states, while circumventing the banks. These are the first steps we should be taking, but they are long overdue. To make the situation absolutely clear, a narrow-minded national approach is blocking the regulations needed for effective control of the financial markets. The Heads of State or Government are preventing us from making progress in the right direction. I include the Chancellor of Germany among them. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in response to Mr Schulz’s questions, you said that the Eurobonds proposal will probably not be successful. Previously, we were told that nothing would come of the financial transaction tax, and other proposals have also come to nothing. We are now in the third year following the financial crisis and I am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package – that would, of course, be an additional measure – or whether we have to expect that, by the weekend, yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others. My question is: how expensive is this delay, especially as it is clearly costing a lot of money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, I just have a brief additional question: are there any other instruments that are still under discussion? I feel rather poorly informed in this regard. Something needs to be done, and we are probably in agreement that the instruments that we have at our disposal should actually be used. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, if the Heads of State or Government have agreed to create a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area, I can only welcome that. The results of the work, lasting several months, of Mr Van Rompuy’s Task Force on economic governance leave a great deal to be desired – although my views on them vary. The attempt is being made to carry out as stringent a control on the budgets as possible in order to avoid long-term deficits, but the cautious recovery from the crisis will immediately be put at risk again by the radical cutting of public expenditure. That is not only completely counterproductive, I also think it is absurd. It seems that we have learnt nothing from our past experience with the Stability and Growth Pact. You cannot impose additional monetary penalties on a country that is already heavily in debt. The bail-out ban and the Stability and Growth Pact destroy the solidarity between the States in the monetary union. Does the economy dictate our policies? Once again, the consequences of the crisis will be borne by the people. We can expect wage dumping and social dumping, cuts in the education sector and a rise in unemployment. This will further increase the burden of the countries affected and make their recovery more difficult. It makes absolutely no sense to increase the pressure on countries like Ireland, Greece or Portugal. Rather, the large economic disparities in Europe should be reduced, in other words we need economic governance. We want a social and fair Europe, built on the principle of solidarity. The precedence of policy over economy must be retained or restored. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected. All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this. We also agree that we must provide aid quickly. A lot of sensible things have already been said. It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them. There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage. We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate. Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction. I would like to make one last point. We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon have emphasised the fact that it does away with the democratic deficit in the EU. In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control. The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard. I repeat: it is a minimum standard. This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism. It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets. New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent. When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament. The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States. Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe. The net contributors seem to have forgotten this. While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe. Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage. The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued. In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget. We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity. This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States. It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities. To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms.

 Mr President, I understand your economic questions, Mr Rübig, and they are very profound in economic terms, which I respect. However, I believe that this is about the relationship between the budget and the European Parliament and its rights. That is a different subject. It has to do with products, but in a quite different sense. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to admit that the Treaty of Lisbon and its social commitments read well. However, we cannot ignore the fact that hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Brussels and other European capitals. They were protesting against a mistaken and unsocial policy towards the crisis. We have hardly begun to turn the corner from this, the worst of crises, yet we are already hearing from many governments that national debts need to be reined in. The emergency parachutes that are the rescue plans need to be folded away, they say, and investment programmes abolished. The Commission is calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be tightened up. States in which reasonable wages and salaries are paid, in which the labour market still follows rules, or in which social security systems are too ‘social’ – which means too expensive – are to be penalised. The banksters are carrying on as if nothing had happened. Pensions and wages are to be cut, consumption taxes perhaps increased. Contributions to social health insurance are rising while services decline. In the light of the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking, Laval and Rueffert cases, it is not only the trade unions that fear that the social balance of the European Union is in a precarious position. The call of the trade unions for a social protection clause deserves our full support. Employee rights, trade union rights and social protection need to be given at least the same significance as – and, indeed, precedence over – the internal market and freedom to provide services. This needs to be clearly laid down in primary law. I am pointing out these facts because the relevant paragraphs merely look good – in reality, they change nothing. Human dignity cannot be ensured without minimum social standards. A social progress clause would improve the badly damaged reputation of the European Union amongst the populace and help to stem social fears. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have provided an impressive insight into the tasks of the various policy areas. Nevertheless, you, and all of us here, have to admit that the trust of European citizens is fading. Mr Verhofstadt has drawn our attention to this and so I will not address the matter in any more detail. These are reliable studies. Citizens have also seen rescue and economic recovery packages amounting to billions of euro flow to the so-called system-relevant banks, and they have seen dangerously high national debts pile up everywhere. Now they are asking themselves who is responsible for this, particularly when, despite a better economic outlook, they are being hit by the Member States’ austerity measures. These austerity measures will result in rising prices for public services, cuts in social benefits, cuts in education services, pay cuts, an extended working life in the face of uncertain pensions and often precarious employment situations. The protest goes far beyond the states hit by the crisis. Today, the unions are striking in France and on 29 September, strike action will be taken in many towns and cities in Europe against the Member States’ austerity policies. Citizens were promised that the Treaty of Lisbon would make the European Union more social and more democratic. The EU, including the Commission and the Parliament, would simply lose credibility if it now said that the Member States are responsible for the austerity measures. Effective financial market reforms, for example, like a ban on hedge funds, or a ban on speculation on raw materials and food derivatives, or even a financial transaction tax, but also the move away from the flexicurity ideology, are now most definitely the responsibility of the European Union. This is something that we all need to involve ourselves with over the next few months. The situation in the Union varies greatly for the different sections of the population and it is full of inconsistencies. The social division in the societies of the EU countries has, in any case, widened dangerously once again. In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, a large amount of money, billions of euro, have gone to rescue or to stand as security for the banks. It has not reached the people with real social needs or been put into education. No one would want to dispute or belittle the EU’s successes. However, papering over the very real inconsistencies in the European Union will not help anyone. I, too, would like to finish by saying something about the Roma in France. I believe that the European Union has a good tradition. However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values. These moral values and human rights apply to French, Polish, English, Spanish or German people in the European Union, just as they do for all Sinti and Roma who live in Europe.

 Mr President, I would like to come back to what Mr Barroso so rightly said against racism and xenophobia. However, in this regard, I would like to say that I am still not satisfied with the debate about the Roma, which we will, of course, continue this afternoon. There are side issues being debated that are extremely dangerous. In Germany, for example, we currently have the Sarrazin debate, which is extremely problematic. In this regard, the fact is being overlooked that in Germany, there are poorly educated sections of the population – of Germans, immigrants and also of Roma and nationals of other countries – who are all relatively poorly catered for in schools and we have insufficient means and a lack of smart methods to be able to really help these children. This breeds racism. Finally, I would like to say that sometimes, racism can arise unintentionally. I would not like to forget the debate about Greece. In this regard, I have seen things in my country, which is not particularly xenophobic, that I had not thought possible. We must remain sensitive to nationalistic, xenophobic and racist statements in the European Union. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for averting imminent crises, involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy, which entail rescuing the banks, on the one hand, and cuts in social security, salaries and pensions, on the other, we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. In our view, these proposals from the Commission on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact are taking the wrong tack. The Commission, following in the footsteps of the working group headed by President Van Rompuy, does not want to modify the Pact’s content, but instead wants to tighten the sanctions and enforce compliance. Both the Commission and Council are calling for further controls and penalties for Member States in deficit. This has not worked in the past and will not work in the future. However, we in the European Parliament’s Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left are pleased, at any rate, that the harshest penalties proposed by the Commission for countries in deficit were not applied. Regulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency. We will do our part to resolve the situation. Europe’s citizens already have to pay; the Council now ought finally to swing into action as well. The problems with the Stability and Growth Packet are not down to lack of compliance or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit to the Maastricht target of 3% of new debt. This may stall growth in the euro area, which is still feeble and at risk. The current economic imbalances in the EU must be eliminated, as this is what speculators are making their living from. One of the ways to do this is for the countries with strong economies to drop their aggressive export strategies which have devastating consequences for the other countries. These countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead. Criteria such as the unemployment rate and the prevalence of poverty must be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. What is needed is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the results of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday of last week must be measured against the global and European challenges that we are facing. Will it be possible to eliminate the causes of the unprecedented crisis in European financial markets at the beginning of May or at least to start taking steps in the right direction? What proposals are being made to the citizens of Europe and the financial markets to rectify the malfunctions in the system? The Council has proudly stated that the banks, which are responsible for causing the crisis, must pay part of the costs and their activities must be more strictly regulated. I welcome this, but in the meantime, I have stopped believing that it will actually happen. You have decided first of all on an international bank levy which does not have unanimous support even within the EU and which has been completely rejected by some G20 countries. It seems unrealistic to think that this decision could ever be implemented. Secondly, in the case of the introduction of a general financial transaction tax, there is only a requirement to investigate whether it is feasible. I doubt that this will really boost the confidence of the players on the global financial market or prevent speculation from taking place or cause the G20 to adopt a resolution on this subject. Thirdly, the stricter measures taken against deficit offenders in a financial and economic crisis are more likely to put the recovery at risk, reduce consumer spending and, in particular, cause socially deprived people to tighten their belts even further. As a result, a greater reduction in the state’s revenue base is inevitable. This will lead to additional austerity measures, which will call into question the financial viability of the Europe 2020 strategy that we have just adopted. Fourthly, no one is taking the opportunity to reinforce the Member States’ revenue base by introducing an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds and green taxes, by raising taxation on high incomes and assets and by ensuring the socially just distribution of taxes. I find this very strange. My fifth point is that the crisis is undermining the democratic foundations of our society. The regulations imposed by the EU on the countries in crisis are also contributing to this. Cuts in social security spending, in wages and pensions and in public services, together with the raising of the pension age, are all causing the poverty gap to widen and the number of people living in poverty to increase even further. I am very much opposed to this. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticism from our group is not directed at whether we need the newly created euro rescue package, but at how it will be implemented. As in 2009, it is once more all about rescuing the banks and the financial sector. Yet again, they will not be helping to pay the cost of averting imminent crises. The EU countries that are in difficulty are once more being ordered to make cuts in social security spending, in public investments, in public services and in salaries and pensions and to increase the pension age. The plan to tighten up the stability pact is pure sado-monetarism. Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are being asked to pay for the crisis which was caused by the failure of European economic policy and gambling on the financial markets. However, this orgy of cuts will send demand on the internal market and tax revenues in Europe through the floor and, as a result, the recession will return. From our perspective, this policy is fundamentally wrong and will not lead to healthy public finances. We are hearing once again that structural reforms should bring about increased growth. More deregulation is to be introduced into the labour markets and the European internal market, while public services will be privatised by means of public-private partnerships. As a result, industrial relations will end up in an even more uncertain and precarious position. This will cause an increase in poverty and social exclusion in the very year when we are supposed to be combating these two phenomena. This is what the Europe 2020 strategy is allegedly intended to fight against. Where will the investment in education, research, green jobs and combating poverty come from if all the Member States are adopting austerity programmes? To put it bluntly, the Europe 2020 strategy is not worth the paper which its very modest objectives are written on. Our group supports the protest campaigns by trade unions and social movements against the catastrophic course taken by the European Union. We agree with the European Trade Union Confederation that an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds, green taxes and heavy taxation of high incomes, assets and inheritances will allow for investment in the environmental and social reconstruction of our industrial societies. Firstly, Europe needs a European social and environmental programme of investment in the future to overcome the crisis. Secondly, it needs decisive measures to break the power of the financial markets and, thirdly, it needs European economic governance and more economic democracy in the interests of the workers. We must have a social Europe or there will soon be no common Europe left. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the most recent Council meetings indicate that far-reaching changes are under way. We are currently experiencing a process of governmentalisation of European policy. The Treaty of Lisbon praised the role of Parliament and the strengthening of that role. We have also spoken out in praise of this. Fundamental agreements are now being reached between the governments and inconceivably large amounts of money are being spent. Until now, the parliaments have had little say in the matter and we must put a stop to this. The method used by those in government has resulted in huge sums being spent to rescue banks which are themselves responsible for getting heavily into debt. These governments have saved casino capitalism using taxpayers’ money. However, they have taken a very hesitant approach to rescuing the states that are in debt. Somewhere, they managed to find EUR 750 billion. The question is whether the money printing press will save economic development. I believe that it is more likely to save the banks’ capital. However, the European Union must be more than just a free internal market with a single currency. Mr Barroso is right when he says that without an economic union, we can forget the monetary union. However, I cannot yet see any clear outlines. Persisting with the failed Stability and Growth Pact has relatively little to do with the sensible coordination of economic policy. What we are lacking is a social union. We are lacking the lasting and effective re-regulation of the financial sector. We are lacking a coordinated tax policy and wage policy and a tax on financial transactions. Although we have been talking about this tax for a long time, it remains just talk. It is time to safeguard the social state by means of the EU institutions, not to dismantle it. The Greeks and other nations are afraid because they can see the measures that are being taken on the social side. It is time to fight for the harmonisation of social standards at a high level. Hedge funds must be banned and tax havens abolished. We are making very slow progress in combating the crisis in the financial markets. In the light of the speed with which the speculators are acting, we are doing far too little. During emergencies like those that we are repeatedly being faced with, it is totally wrong to nationalise the billions which are being spent as losses and privatise the profits. The banks must not be allowed direct access to taxpayers’ money with the support of the state. Incidentally, one thing is clear to me, and that is that in the current conditions, we will have to redefine the term ‘bank robber’. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must, of course, provide assistance to Greece. However, the so-called rescue operation also has some absurd elements. With France and Germany acting like great powers, the process of reaching a decision on the assistance package was very expensive and protracted. For years, the financial markets have been increasingly deregulated and now everyone is surprised that it is expensive. Who will now pay the price for the political errors? The workers, ordinary citizens? Banks are not being placed under any obligation. No, once again it is the taxpayers who are to pick up the tab and dig deep in their pockets to pay for the profiteering of the banks. Once again, dependent workers are to have to accept pay cuts. With the dictates from the International Monetary Fund, any semblance of a democratic decision-making process has been eliminated. In the case of the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico, application of the polluter-pays principle has been called for. I believe that is right. Anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt. At the moment – at least in Germany – banks do not even have to pay back the debts that they have taken on and with which they are happily speculating against the euro – yes, against the euro. Furthermore, they are still speculating, even though we have been saying for a long time that something needs to be done about this. Proposals for what could be done are on the table. A ban on trading credit derivatives and on short selling, the introduction of a financial market transaction tax, special levies on bonuses in the financial sector, a legally binding bank and insurance levy – all of these proposals are on the table. Of course, Greece must also do its homework. Like other countries of the European Union, Greece should also tax wealth, combat corruption and reduce its arms expenditure. Mr Cohn-Bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this. I will therefore omit the facts in this regard and endorse what he said in his speech. I can understand people in Athens going out into the streets and protesting. What I cannot understand is the violence. I agree with everyone who has expressed sympathy for the victims, whose suffering is most regrettable. Violence will achieve the opposite of what the protesters and honest demonstrators want. We must call for an end to the violence. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the decision made by the aviation safety authorities not to put passenger safety at risk was absolutely right, even if this meant closing European airspace for several days and involved financial losses for the airlines. In my opinion, it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk. What does ‘at their own risk’ actually mean in this case? I welcome the fact that the Commission is considering authorising special State aid for the airlines, which would otherwise be in serious financial difficulties as a result of the current situation. We will be talking later about employment in the European Union. If the EU and the Member States can at least help to prevent things from getting even worse, this is the right thing to do. However, in return for the provision of State aid, the airlines must give a binding undertaking not to make staff cuts or salary cuts. They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation. It is high time that the Commission put in place a permanent common European monitoring system for aviation safety. This monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping. I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach. Competition and the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to take priority over the safety of human lives. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr Barroso, you have spoken about your work programme and it has been discussed in Parliament. You have said that you want to follow up on the critical remarks. I have one question. Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it. However, I have the impression that very little has changed in the way the banks do business. I would also be interested to hear the answer to another question. Do you think that we and the Commission have done enough? If not, what do you believe it is still necessary to do in order to combat the causes of the financial crisis in the longer term, so that the banks cannot go on doing business in the way they currently are? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I have another brief question. The chair of Deutsche Bank, Dr Ackermann, is a difficult man to make an impression on. He has recently said outright that he wants to make returns of 25%. Do you not think that this flies in the face of the measures taken by the Commission and the individual governments? He is not changing anything. He has said that he wants to make returns of 25% once again. This is what Dr Ackermann, the chair of Deutsche Bank, which is an extremely important bank, is saying. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, it is a good thing that the Heads of State or Government were able to agree an emergency package, but this is hardly a really European solution. The German Government has, for tactical electoral reasons – with regard to North Rhine-Westphalia – gone quite far down the road of populism. The agreement, then, was hanging by the thread of the conversation between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. It is no package to cover the citizens. The objective of the funding mechanism is to consist, and I quote, of ‘incentives for the fastest possible return by the financial market to setting high-risk prices’. Economic policy coordination is to be built on the failed principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. The State and the citizens are to make savings, while the financial markets – the banks – are to evaluate whether enough savings have been made. I regard that as a dubious procedure. In the EU there is currently an unemployment rate of 10% – the highest since 1998. Over 20% of under-25-year-olds are out of work. There is a need to say very specifically where we want to make savings. Otherwise, I fear the worst. Why has the Council not agreed on an increase in the cohesion and structural funds or an immediate prohibition on trading credit derivatives? Why has it postponed agreement on specific targets to combat poverty in the EU indefinitely? I am not saying, incidentally, that they have done so deliberately, but to all intents and purposes the postponement will endure indefinitely. I consider that to be a scandal in this, the European Year for Combating Poverty. June this year is much too late. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, it is rare for me to agree with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission. However, when they both call for solidarity with Greece and warn of renationalisation, then I can only agree with them, because what they say is correct. Moreover, recently in Strasbourg, we heard Mr Barroso thinking aloud as to whether the worst of the speculation on the financial markets should be banned outright. The increasing social chasm in the European Union and within the Member States can no longer be overlooked by anyone, yet the pressing issues associated with this are not on the agenda of the Heads of State at their first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda. As you are aware, my group is not at all keen on this strategy as it has been drafted by the Commission, because it is based on the failed ideology of competition which led to the crisis. We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests. EU 2020 is miles away from this. It is quite something, however, when individual members of the Federal German Government turn up and thunder against the few binding goals of the EU 2020 strategy, such as for the employment quota, for research and education and for combating poverty – and that in the European Year for Combating Poverty! I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the Heads of Government. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr Barroso, last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy. It contains important objectives. The Council has now imposed an austerity programme on Greece, which, in my opinion, makes the achievement of these goals impossible, with one State having 3% of the gross domestic product of the EU. However, you continue to persist with the failed Stability and Growth Pact. At the same time, several Member States are calling for a European monetary fund or even economic governance. My questions are as follows. Are you going to review your EU 2020 proposal again in order to integrate the idea of the monetary fund and economic governance so as to initiate a move away from tax and wage dumping and from the prevailing competitive ideology? Are you going to take measures immediately, together with the Member States, to prohibit speculation against the euro by the very banks that have just been bailed out using taxpayers’ money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 I am not entirely satisfied. The issue is that taxpayers’ money is being used to speculate against the Greek State. Some of this taxpayers’ money comes from German banks and it has also been lent out by German banks. Yet, while we are repeatedly told that some sort of measures will be taken, nothing actually happens. I am therefore rather disappointed that so little has been done to simply prohibit certain things in the EU so as to put a stop to such speculation once and for all and allow us to genuinely concentrate on growth and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, in times of need, you discover who your friends are, as the saying goes. There are 27 governments in the European Union trying – each in its own way – to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries. This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens. The euphemistic wage restraint policy, reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age, family, sickness and desired education have all been mentioned. The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets. The banks have already made more progress than the states. Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank, which, in Germany, were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers’ money, are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of excessively expensive government bonds in Greece. Taxpayers’ money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal, honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer people are fleeing. (Heckling)
 Believe me, I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany. However, one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief, while at the same time, the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes. Who will have to find this money, though? I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet. Was it not Germany, formerly the world’s highest exporter, that years ago separated wage increases from productivity, thus resulting in social dumping? In ancient Greek theatre, a crisis means an opportunity – yes, the challenge of a turning point. In order to bring about such a turning point, we must demand that a statutory minimum wage finally be put in place. The same work in the same place must receive the same wage. We need harmonisation of tax types within the Union, but above all, we need genuine European regulation and control of the financial markets and a real European economic and finance policy, coordinated on the basis of solidarity, with binding social and environmental targets. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT agreement was negotiated on the basis of a dubious procedure and quickly pushed through only one day before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to circumvent Parliament. However, I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement. We have big brother’s little sister waiting for our approval. Mrs Clinton believes that she can persuade the Members of this Parliament to do something which we would not accept from our own governments. From my point of view, it is fundamentally wrong for alleged terrorism investigators to have such extensive access to databases, because this undermines people’s self-determination over their own personal data. Personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used. In addition, the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end. It will not be possible to take legal action to discover the whereabouts of the data or to claim damages for its illegal use by third countries. This gives the state precedence over its citizens, who will all be reduced to the status of objects of suspicion. The Member States are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the EU. To give some examples in Germany, should Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees? Will it now become the norm for the German Government to buy from tax investigators data that has been obtained illegally? We find ourselves in a situation in which Parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision. Why should Google be able to set data thresholds in future? It is important to combat terrorism and, in particular, its causes, and I believe that we all agree on this, but not at the cost of fundamental rights. In this context, I have heard many speeches which refer to the EU as a community of values. We are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in September 2009, I had to tell you that your political guidelines were continuing a failed Commission policy. Your neoliberal guidelines do not reveal a strategy for more social justice, nor do they provide better protection for Europe against crises. They provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe. Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme. You can expect no applause for this from my group. Already during this new parliamentary term, this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously, and I very much welcome that. I am thinking of the new Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission and of the rejection of one of the candidate Commissioners, and I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will once again be conscientious in its addressing of the SWIFT agreement. Transparency and fairness are vital in the agreements between the institutions – only when we have these can we begin to talk about policy. It is about the people of Europe and the rest of the world, it is about good jobs and more rights to a good education and fair pay, it is about their right to peaceful development and an intact environment. Therefore, Mr Barroso, my group will not support your guidelines or your staffing proposal. Prepare yourself for our harsh, but fair, exchange of views with you and your College. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group also participated actively in the hearings of the candidates. Some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on us. We are less enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolios. That also includes the rather mysterious – although perhaps soon to be less mysterious – area of responsibility of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is also Vice-President of the Commission. However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge. In this regard, all of our questions related primarily to political projects. In what direction should the European integration process go? Which measures are most important to the Commission candidate? There were far too many vague answers to these questions and answers that, politically speaking, we do not support. Despite claims of a more social Europe, they persisted in advocating a route towards deregulation, privatisation or the flexicurity concept. The flexibility of workers was the top priority and social security was right at the bottom. Climate protection is on the agenda, but we are not seeing a move away from coal-powered generation of electricity or from nuclear power. I do not see the EU taking a leading role in climate protection and in development aid. Nothing has been said about consistent disarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons within Europe. Mr Barroso, Mr President, as much as I appreciate the candidates coming forward for the hearing, my group is unable to give your College a positive vote. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency. I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU. On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy. However, even though it has been acknowledged that a new political approach is needed, where is it? I have not seen it. With the new Commission, the new Parliament and the President of the European Council, however, there would now be a chance to start a totally new debate. Of course, there is the new treaty and the still to be implemented opportunity for the citizens initiative, too. Our starting point is clear: our priority, above all others, in particular, above the interests of profits, must remain the social and environmental concerns of the people. That needs to become the new basic principle of the European Union’s strategies and legislation, as only then will the citizens perceive the EU as representing progress in the long term. My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax. In yesterday’s debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future. We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt. Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have a question for you about the Tobin tax. This tax is a worthwhile proposal, but as yet, no one has introduced it. Everyone says that it will never be introduced unless all the Member States do so at the same time. I am now afraid, after the decision at the European summit, which I welcome, that this will once again be postponed, because we are not all starting at the same time. I would like to know what your opinion on this is and what you think are the chances of the Tobin tax being introduced. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to welcome the two candidates on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Above all, we welcome the fact that a woman has been elected. We assume that the two candidates for the high offices will not only focus on the content of their responsibilities, but will also develop a cooperative approach to Parliament. We expect the Council to deal more closely with the social issues resulting from the crisis and to draw the right conclusions. Billions have so far been paid to the bankers, but there has been virtually no help for the ordinary people. Mr Schulz is right when he says that the casino is open again, but at the same time, poverty and, in particular, child poverty is growing. Four million jobs were lost throughout Europe as a result of the crisis. According to reports from the Commission, this figure could increase to seven million over the course of the next year. We know that estimates of this kind are often lower than the real figures. For example, 1.5 million people in Germany are on short-time work and it is important to emphasise this. However, growing unemployment and poverty are the first signs of even greater inequality of opportunity which will have a major impact on educational opportunities. We also need to discuss this subject. The question that arises is whether the Heads of State or Government will find ways out of the crisis which combine the European concept of integration with social progress and which have a real impact for the citizens of Europe. Instead of exit strategies for the economic recovery programmes and mandatory budget consolidation, we need a change of policy. I have just three observations to make about this. Firstly, we expect the Council to give a statement on its position on the plans for the 2020 strategy, which is intended to replace the failed Lisbon Strategy. Innovation and knowledge, combating exclusion, green economic strategies, a digital Europe – as a list of slogans, this does not sound too bad. However, we urgently need concrete proposals describing how all of this will be implemented. Secondly, the Council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets. I have a number of legitimate questions about how the Council can bring this into line with existing treaties, because in some cases, restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments are not permitted or wanted. We are interested to see how you will achieve this. Thirdly, I would like to emphasise once again that the Council must give a clear signal after Copenhagen that a binding climate change agreement is needed. Voluntary commitments have never achieved the desired objective. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 What I found pleasing about the special summit was that there was a gender balance. We would like to pay tribute to that achievement. I would also like to add that we will continue to support you if you continue to maintain this gender balance. We now have two new figureheads for the European Union to deal with, about whom all sides have said that they will have to grow into their roles. That, of course, will always be the case. There is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights. I see it like this: today’s lightweights are tomorrow’s heavyweights, and vice versa
. Many a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next. That notwithstanding, we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome. The social consequences, especially, are giving us lots to deal with. In Europe, tens of millions of people are affected by unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The number of crisis victims is going through the roof. In the developing world, the consequences are much worse. Are you prepared, Mr Barroso, together with the new Commission, to learn the lessons of the wrong turns taken through radical free-market policies? Are you prepared to bring about an urgently needed change of policy to put people ahead of profits and social interests ahead of competitive ones? Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by all 27 Member States. Many will be celebrating this as a great success, but my group will not be joining in these celebrations. I have stated the reasons for this many times in this House and I do not intend to do so again. Unfortunately, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply for the citizens of three Member States gives me doubts about the EU’s great progress in the protection of fundamental rights. I mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and Václav Havel’s speech. However, precisely because the Left in Europe wants a social, peaceful and environmentally sustainable European integration, we will also continue to use the framework provided by the treaty for this purpose. We have done this up to now, and we will continue to do so. In this connection, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament will now have more rights. Amidst all the rejoicing, the Heads of State or Government would also have been well advised to use their recent summit for more tangible policies. The greatest challenge facing the world is climate change. In the run-up to the world climate conference in Copenhagen, the European Union has, unfortunately, lost the leading role that it had set itself. For one thing, the substance of the commitments to reduce CO2
 emissions does not correspond to what is actually needed. Moreover, it is unacceptable that the EU Member States quite clearly want to avoid their financial responsibilities, even though this is a situation where we cannot afford to delay our action. It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine-growing region – although I do not begrudge you that. It is quite simply about survival and, incidentally, also about peace in our world. Climate change is already causing poverty and hunger and forcing millions of people to flee from their homelands. Everyone in this Chamber has surely spoken at one time or another of global challenges that cannot be overcome at national level. Climate protection, peace and combating poverty are just such challenges. If the European Union does not act in a consistent and exemplary manner in this regard, it will lose its acceptance as an international player. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, there has been much speculation over staffing issues during the last three months and over the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which my group has rejected for three good reasons. In simplistic terms, firstly we want priority to be given to a social Europe rather than to a radical market orientation. Secondly, we want disarmament instead of the development of military capabilities and, thirdly, we want more direct democracy rather than a Europe made up of elites. We should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content. While we are arguing over names and positions, more and more people are losing their jobs. The banks have, of course, been rescued. At the same time, Mr Barroso is calling for us to bring an end to the economic recovery plans soon – yesterday the deadline was set for 2011 – and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be reduced quickly. This will mean reductions in salaries and pensions, cuts in public services and social security provision, higher value added tax and a lack of collective agreements. One current example of this can be found in the German commercial cleaning industry where workers have been on strike for three days. These are the problems which are affecting people in Europe and these are the problems which the Council should be dealing with. Instead of this, the main subject of concern is adding clauses to the Treaty of Lisbon to encourage the Czech President to sign it. If this is really as simple as it seems to be in practice, I would ask the Heads of Government to think more carefully about a social progress clause in the Treaty of Lisbon. That would be much more appropriate. At the beginning of the parliamentary term, a series of positive proposals were made concerning a more social EU policy. This did not just relate to the social progress clause. It was also about a new economic recovery plan for Europe in order to create and retain jobs and about increased investment and sustainable environmental growth. A European Employment Pact for more and better jobs, for equal pay, for more rights for employees and better working conditions was called for. There were discussions about increased solidarity among the Member States and ensuring the sustainability of the social security and pension systems. I have not yet identified any strategy within the policies of the Member States or the policies of the Commission which might lead us towards these objectives. Of course, the Council must now consider the appointments to the new Commission and the possible changes to the Treaty of Lisbon. However, the focus must be on the problems I have referred to and on their solutions. My group’s vote on the College of Commissioners will be dependent on this. Lothar Bisky,  
Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, you are calling for us to leave behind the economic stimulus programmes soon and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be quickly reduced. Yet even your most recent forecast promises growth in EU GDP of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009 as a whole, that would represent a 4% decrease. According to your own forecasts, unemployment rates in the EU will rise to over 11% in 2010. Do you not think that early, drastic cuts in public expenditure could stop the small beginnings of recovery in their tracks? Or do you believe that the financial sector, for the moment, has got over the problem and the ordinary people should bear the costs of the crisis? Already, you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia, Hungary and Romania: lower wages, lower pension benefits, fewer public services and higher VAT. Is that your idea of a social Europe? Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated mandatory referendums on the Reform Treaty throughout Europe. Voters in Ireland were the only ones with the opportunity to make their decision directly a year and a half ago. If we want the people to decide, then we must accept the result, even if we do not like it. The government in Ireland went against the principle of democracy and conducted a second referendum, partly as a result of pressure from other Member States. Now they have the result they wanted. We on the Left abide by the principle of democracy, but our concern over the political orientation of the EU remains. The number of ‘no’ votes in Ireland indicates that we are not the only ones with this concern. Our three main points of criticism are, firstly, that the previous policy of liberalising the financial markets, tax competition, decoupling of financial policy from economic policy and the dismantling of the social state contributed to the economic and financial crisis. As a result, this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in Europe. Other than declarations of intent, very little has happened so far in terms of the regulation of the financial markets. On the contrary, while the unemployment figures are rising, the big banks are once again expecting large profits. The Treaty of Lisbon will continue this market economy policy with free competition. This is something that we cannot support. Instead, we call for a fundamentally different approach to tackling social challenges. Our aim is the introduction of a social progress clause with minimum wages applying throughout the EU – the same pay for the same work in the same place. We must combat wage dumping. Our second point of criticism is that the call for the Member States to gradually improve their military capabilities is incompatible with the aims of the Left, as is the entrenchment of a European armaments agency in primary European law. We will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests. We do not want this kind of treaty; we want a treaty of disarmament rather than armament. It is paradoxical to be referred to as an opponent of Europe for this reason. Anyone in Europe who is in favour of armament is classed as a friend of Europe, but anyone in Europe who is in favour of disarmament is classed as an enemy of Europe. That is politically absurd! So, the referendum in Ireland has taken place and, even if it did not turn out exactly as we would have wanted, we on the Left will continue to work to achieve more direct democracy in Europe.

on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you represent the continuity of a policy, Mr Barroso, which has contributed to the greatest economic crisis in post-war history. While the casinos in the major financial centres are reopening, the citizens of the world are footing the bill. The consequences of the crisis are unemployment, poverty, lower incomes and less education. You maintain that the financial crisis came primarily from the US and that it was only the bankers who caused the collapse. We say that the political system, including the policies of the EU Commission, was responsible for promoting casino capitalism. The ideology of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation has led to the crisis. Continuing as we have done in the past will result in an even more serious crisis. The political system must take responsibility, learn from its mistakes and give up its neo-liberal ideals. European policy must focus consistently on the interests of the people of Europe. I cannot identify a focus of this kind in your guidelines. However, I am pleased that in your remarks today, social issues were given greater importance than was the case a year ago. I would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples. You want to adhere to the Lisbon strategy. However, the people of Europe need good jobs at wages which will allow them to live with dignity. We need to put on the agenda a reduction and not an extension of working hours. We expect the new Commission to restructure the Posting of Workers Directive. Europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach. For this reason, we have proposed, together with some others, a legally binding clause on social progress and a charter of public services, which will give precedence to social security and services of general interest over internal market regulations. From what you have said, I understand that you do not think much of this. In the Zimmermann report, the European Parliament calls for a minimum wage of at least 60% of the average income in all Member States. You maintain that you can do nothing about this. I think that you could, for example, by means of the employment policy guidelines. You are focusing solely on the Stability and Growth Pact which has proved to be an ineffective tool, in particular, during the crisis. We want a social pact to replace the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact. You believe that a few new financial supervision regulations will keep the greed of the financial world in check. We are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements. You, and I quote, ‘support every paragraph of the Treaty of Lisbon’. We want a social Europe instead of a continuation of the radical focus on the internal market. We want a commitment to disarmament and civil conflict management instead of the continuing growth in military capability. You see Europe as a leading power and we want to spread the ideology of free trade and marketisation of all areas of life throughout the world. We stand for intercultural, multilateral dialogue and the greatest possible support for developing countries in overcoming the economic, food, financial and climate crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, let us elect a Commission together which sets itself the objective of a social, peaceful, economically sustainable and democratic European Union. If we want to gain acceptance among the people of Europe for the EU project, we need a break with radical free-market concepts and more direct democracy. In this case, Mr Barroso is the wrong man for the job of president. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has presented an ambitious work programme which includes a proposal for more transparency. Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing. Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy. The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis. They are innocent parties. Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis. I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers. Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism. We are keen to see what happens with the Baltic Sea Strategy and I would be behind the President-in-Office of the Council if he were to focus on dialogue with Russia. We would also like the European Union to support the pledges of President Obama and President Medvedev with regard to the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The European Union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament. The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers. Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy. This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars. Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place. The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures. We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries. We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment. I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, I am pleased that a neighbour from Poland has become President of this House. I come from eastern Germany and work near Słubice. Słubice and Frankfurt/Oder are both part of a united Europe. I would like to thank you for focusing in particular on the continued integration of Eastern and Western Europe. There is still much to do in this respect, as we are all aware. However, I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe. I hope that I will soon be able to speak to you in more depth. I have started to work towards this. Two of my sons speak Polish. I once had the honour of presenting the Andrzej Wajda film prize to the director Andreas Dresen and of making a speech to mark the occasion. Andrzej Wajda and other Polish directors are part of our European culture. I hope that Western Europe and Eastern Europe will not forget the special achievements of Eastern European culture.

 I rejected the report because it advocates a further militarisation of the EU and demands military autonomy via increased investment in armament, defence and military sectors despite the financial and economic crisis. It also calls for the expansion of military (training) operations and further strengthens EU-NATO cooperation. It encourages the use of development aid (European Development Fund) to finance security operations, supports and encourages further civil-military cooperation and advocates subordination of policy areas under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and fosters the Military Industrial Complex (MIC). It supports and presses for the ATHENA mechanism and use of battle-groups. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject this report because the mutual defence clause (Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union) turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) paves the way for military interventions within the EU. The explicit ‘obligation’ to react ‘by all means’ in case of armed aggression against a Member State goes beyond NATO’s mutual assistance clause since non-armed attacks are also covered. Within the solidarity clause, military support is also demanded in case of terror attacks, natural or man-made disasters, which implies military operations within the EU. Cyber attacks, pandemics and energy shortages can also lead to activation of the solidarity clause. I voted against the report since there is no clear definition of what falls under the solidarity clause and whether social unrest/strikes are also considered ‘man-made disasters’. Furthermore, the report prefers military to civil measures outside and inside the EU, and focuses only on EU defence and military solutions. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject the report because it advocates the militarisation of cyber security and regards the existing civil approach as inadequate, even though the risk is relatively low.

 Although the report is based on the correct assumption that climate change can exacerbate existing conflicts, it wrongly focuses on repressive and military counter-measures whilst advocating further EU militarisation. I reject the report because it promotes systematic implementation of military elements into climate policy, financing from the EU budget of military measures linked to climate change, and further closer coordination and cooperation of EU and NATO as well as a special focus on development of military capabilities, pooling and sharing, including the merge of civil and military assets and capabilities. Current conflicts in developing countries can only be solved effectively, also with regard to climate change, if the underlying root causes of global distributive inequity are addressed; the military is the wrong solution.

Mr President, the EU has won the Nobel Peace Prize, and I would not wish to question its achievements, such as its role in reconciliation after the Second World War. However, the reports before us speak a different language. The mutual defence clause, in effect, turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause includes the option of military intervention in Member States in response to man-made disasters. Let me ask the House this: would a Europe-wide general strike constitute such a man-made disaster? Will soldiers from Germany soon be deployed against striking workers in Greece? The implementation of the demands set out in the Annual Report on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would mean a quantum leap in the EU’s military development and an expansion of military intervention worldwide, probably with a robust mandate.  Much of this, including Member States’ obligation to develop their military capabilities, has to do with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Let me say this: the Left in Europe did the right thing by rejecting this Treaty and we will continue their tireless efforts to bring about an amendment of these Treaty provisions. Sabine Lösing,

Madam President, over recent years, the international arms trade has grown further, and the countries of the European Union can once again claim a dubious success: at 34%, they have the leading share of the trade. Many of these exports go to countries with – and I word this carefully – a dubious human rights record, and into conflict areas. That is why there needs to be a complete ban on arms trading, especially in relation to conflict regions. The current negotiations at UN level on an Arms Trade Treaty represent a step in the right direction. We continue to hope that the treaty will not later turn out to be a paper tiger as toothless as previous agreements. For that reason, following a successful conclusion of the treaty, implementation needs to remain on the political agenda consistently. The constructive, cross-group cooperation on the current resolution is a good sign, and one that I am pleased about. It is therefore all the more disappointing that we were unable to avoid the positive reference to the arms industry in paragraph 2 of the resolution. Aside from the moral aspects, I would like to point out that studies have concluded beyond doubt that the influence of military expenditure on jobs is very low in comparison with other public spending. Rather than jobs, it is mostly about ensuring the profits of this branch of industry, the more so given that disarmament and conversion could promote sustainable development, growth and jobs.

 Mr President, ‘yet another war over oil’: that could be the heading for an intervention on the current conflict in Sudan. Once again, the civilian population of both countries are enduring indescribable suffering. All violent attacks and assaults are naturally to be condemned, and naturally we must call for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, that does not absolve us from talking about the causes, or from looking back critically at whether the EU’s clear commitment to the splitting off of South Sudan was responsible given the current circumstances. There will be no quick solution; that much is certain. It is also certain, however, that the problems cannot be resolved by means of armed conflict. Right now, it is essential that we maintain the arms embargo that in fact exists, in order to prevent further escalations. I would like to remind you that in 2004, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Sudan and, in 2011, also to South Sudan, but this was unilaterally relaxed in November 2011 to support security sector reform in South Sudan. However difficult it may be, we need to push for diplomatic negotiations. If the international community wants to help end the conflict, it must do so in the role of a neutral mediator, not led by its own interests. The role that the EU has played has not been neutral. I am very concerned as to whether there will be more such scenarios in future, whether we will see more natural resource-rich regions of Africa splitting off and a spiralling of state disintegration. The foreign policy instrument of state building must not be allowed to be an instrument of such a development. Using access to reserves of natural resources to guide us in our foreign policy activities will bring not peace, but rather death and misery. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, nuclear weapons are among the vilest weapons there are and they should be abolished worldwide. Civil use of nuclear energy is impossible to control. We therefore need to do everything we can to ensure that there is a worldwide move away from nuclear power and towards global nuclear disarmament, and specifically in this case towards a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East – and we must do so in a peaceful way. Until then, the current treaties will apply. As worthy of criticism as the regime in Iran is, it should be noted that, unlike India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It therefore exercises the right to the civil use of nuclear energy guaranteed to all states that have signed this Treaty. That is dangerous – just as it is dangerous in other countries. No one thinks – quite rightly – of taking military action against all the states that have nuclear power plants, or penalising them with sanctions. Neither the secret services nor the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency provide solid evidence that Iran is building, preparing or planning nuclear weapons. Yet blatant threats of war have been made against Iran for many years on precisely this pretext. In addition, there is an increasingly aggressive economic war being waged with the intention of destabilising the country. This policy, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious danger to world peace and limits the opportunities for progressive opposition in Iran. As is so often the case, it seems very much as though peace and human rights are to fall victim to the global interests of the United States and the EU.

 Mr President, today’s discussion takes place against the background of the economic and financial crisis which has deprived many people of their livelihood, their rights and their democracy, and against the background of the thousands of people, in particular children, who are dying of hunger throughout the world. If we are to make savings in Europe, then we should cut our defence spending. Defence means defence against territorial attacks, so it is good that we can say: Yes, we can make savings in this area. However, even if I were to accept the prevailing logic and to assume that our defence requirements are at a very high level, it seems to me that the aim here is to reach a higher level of military capability under the guise of pressure on costs and to give the defence industry a better and more reliable source of income. I think that the scenario of a defence capability under threat is being exaggerated. I would like to mention here that it is not true that cuts in defence spending will lead to a rise in unemployment. That is simply not the case. However, high levels of defence spending do not only involve huge sums of money which are needed elsewhere. The proposals in Mr Lisek’s report also mean putting democracy at risk, for example, by means of the ATHENA mechanism, which is not subject to democratic controls, or by combining civilian and military capabilities. We will be voting against this report. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, have tabled a minority opinion, which calls, among other things, for radical disarmament and a purely civilian EU.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I welcome the excellent cross-party cooperation and majority support for the joint resolution on banning cluster munitions. The resolution constitutes an important and strong signal in the fight against these deadly weapons. We must not forget that cluster munitions and bombs were used in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, and – I would like to remind this Parliament – also by EU Member States. There is no justification for continuing to use these weapons or to store or produce them – none whatsoever – not for defence and not for protecting borders. I urgently call on all Member States not to support the proposed draft text of the new Protocol VI to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. This draft would entail a dramatic step backwards. This draft text prohibits – and this cannot be said clearly enough – cluster munitions and bombs made prior to 1980. That would mean that cluster munitions produced after this date would continue to be permitted and could also continue to be used in future. That is something that we must not accept. The Convention on Cluster Munitions that entered into force in August 2010 prohibits all cluster bombs and munitions, and that must be the benchmark.

− Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a wider scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 I voted against this report as I reject the notion that, if in doubt, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief should be tackled from within the framework of the common security and defence policy (CSDP). What is more, there must not be any mixing of civilian and military activities, something that this report would make possible. I furthermore strongly reject the introduction of security policy elements into the areas of civil protection and humanitarian assistance on the strength of any purported threat of terrorism. I advocate civilian disaster relief independent of security policy concerns and argue for the build-up of the necessary logistical capabilities, which must be independent of the military. Moreover, I would point out that the report refers to the solidarity clause in a positive light, a clause which, for example, also makes military intervention against striking workers possible.

 Mr President, in Israel, too, thousands are demonstrating for social justice and democracy and indicating the connection between their desperate social situation, settlement policy and the huge military expenditure. The policies of those in power in Israel are directed against the Palestinians and also against their own people. The establishment of peace in the region is therefore in the interests of the people of both Israel and Palestine and of world peace – and urgently so. Anyone who does not support the inclusion of Palestine in the United Nations is not doing what is necessary for the security of the people in Israel and Palestine. All forces in Europe must work to obtain a two-state solution, and political decisions must be taken. The recognition of Palestine’s diplomatic representations as embassies in all European States would improve the status of Palestine under international law. All European States must insist that the settlements, which contravene international law, be stopped. Only the equality of the Israeli and the Palestinian people can bring peace and social justice for everyone and marginalise radical forces. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, there is no other policy area where the European Parliament has so few rights of codecision as in the fields of foreign and, especially, of military policy. When it comes to EU military operations, it is the Heads of State or Government alone, meeting in the European Council, who make the decisions. When it comes to the key issue of war and peace, then, the European Parliament has absolutely no right to be heard or even to oversee. There is not even a binding rule that Parliament must be informed before the Union launches a foreign intervention. In light of the establishment of the European External Action Service, which, in practice, has become the executive arm of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), and of the start-up fund for military operations, which has a firm basis in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is a need for more monitoring powers for the national parliaments and for the European Parliament, and for these powers to actually be effective. The resolution on the table does state that the cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament needs to be improved, but there is a definite lack of specific proposals as to how that can be done. The interparliamentary assembly that we have proposed – to be composed of representatives from both national and European level – could pave the way for the resolution or at least attenuation of glaring democratic deficits. Such an interparliamentary assembly need not be composed of all the parties represented in the parliaments in order to ensure real and democratic supervision of European foreign and security policy. It would be nice if our amendments enacting this were to be approved tomorrow. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, in February, many people, including in this House, were full of both hope and concern about the future of Sudan. There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes. It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support. Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again. The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns. I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states. A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however. If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to. Aid for Sudan must be impartial and not tied to any one interest group. It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid. In order to prevent further fuelling of the conflict, all supplying of weapons must be halted. We are calling for an end to all civil/military collaboration and to the military training mission.

 Mr President, in a deeply divided country like Côte d’Ivoire, can a lasting peace be brought about by violent means and can the winner of the presidential election be legitimised? This seems extremely doubtful, especially as the real causes of the conflict have not been resolved. The country was destabilised as a result of economic problems brought about largely by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank. The sanctions which were rapidly imposed with the aim of weakening the Gbagbo government have exacerbated the situation and given rise to a humanitarian crisis in Côte d’Ivoire. The legitimacy of both claimants to the presidency is in dispute. The armies of both sides are responsible for massacring the civilian population. Once again, the West has taken sides and now the United Nations (UN) is waging war alongside French troops to try to ensure the victory of one side in the conflict. Will European powers once again be deciding the fate of African people as they did in colonial times, but this time with the support of the UN? What has happened to the principles of international law? Is this the concept on which the UN was founded? Instead of aiming for peaceful solutions to conflicts, the UN seems to be supporting civil wars or taking sides in them. Whose interest is this in? Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, the Belder report has been considerably improved by the amendments, and my group can agree with a great number of statements. Unfortunately, for all that they are correct, it primarily contains descriptions of the situation, but the underlying philosophy of a realistic future perspective has not been developed. The human rights situation in Iran is intolerable. However, sanctions will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation. In order to promote democratisation in Iran, we must do everything we can to make the international situation less tense. Worsening international relations brings with it the danger that further anti-democratic measures will be taken inside Iran, which will result in weakening the opposition. A policy of detente would also have to put an end to every form of threatening behaviour. Negotiations and international relations can only be successful if diplomatic recognition of all partners is a given. Only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved. I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution, and on the grounds that I have described, I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected.

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, will the situation now improve for the people in Southern Sudan or is the split more in the interests of the West so that we can get control of the oil reserves? In any case, the South has huge challenges ahead. Without a functional infrastructure and with the current disastrous economic situation, civilian assistance and humanitarian aid will be needed for a long time. Unfortunately, the danger of violent conflicts has probably not been eliminated for certain. However, experts believe that this cannot be resolved by military means. On the contrary, a focus on military means prevents a real solution to the conflicts being found. The necessary civilian assistance can be provided much more efficiently without military involvement. The transfer of civilian tasks to the military hinders the sustainable development of civilian structures. An example of this is Darfur. A massive military apparatus has now taken over the tasks of humanitarian and development organisations there, something that has been sharply criticised by these organisations. Our demands are that the focus be on purely civilian conflict management and assistance measures, in other words a reduction of the UN mission to the civilian components and no potential use of EU battle groups. In addition, in terms of a development perspective we call for Sudan’s debt be written off. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, many thanks to Mr Gahler for his report. It is clear, also from this report, that there is enormous interest in the natural resources of the Arctic region. As a result of climate change, oil and gas and other resources can be extracted increasingly easily. The issue of making better use of shipping routes has already been discussed. The logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region. Industrial development – in particular, through the extraction of oil and gas, the expansion of commercial fishing and increased shipping traffic – will all necessarily lead to the disturbance, or perhaps even destruction, of this highly sensitive ecosystem, with devastating consequences. Unfortunately, this report deals in generalities and does not contain any effective strategies for combating these dangers. A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic. The bordering states of Russia and NATO members USA, Canada, Denmark and Norway have already begun militarising the Arctic region and intend to protect their interests there. Climate change has led to this situation in the Arctic. We need to prevent the catastrophic progress of this change, something that can only be achieved through a rapid changeover to renewable energy sources. However, this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot. In common with numerous environmental organisations, we are calling for a moratorium on new oil extraction projects in the Arctic. A treaty needs to be agreed – similar to the Treaty on the Antarctic – that prohibits the extraction of mineral resources in the region. Last but not least, we are calling for the immediate demilitarisation of the region and therefore for the establishment of the Arctic as a demilitarised zone. Because my group and I are unable to support the results of the own-initiative report presented here, the GUE/NGL has submitted an alternative report.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of that and, of course, it is not possible to impose this from above. The question remains, however: Who was consulted? Which states are involved? Which indigenous peoples are affected? Was there any consultation with the people who may benefit from the situation, or with those who may lose their livelihood? I think that further dialogue is needed. The talks held so far are not enough. We need to try to keep this dialogue as broad as possible, also consulting with wider sections of society, possibly including the indigenous peoples in particular. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, what is this all about? Is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism? This is an important question when it comes to assessing the situation. Experts on this region are of the opinion that this is more to do with crime than with religiously motivated international terrorism. Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests. It may be that this is also about Africa as one of the areas in which Europe is interested. In the words of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, it concerns Africa as Europe’s backyard. I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa. The Sahel region can only be made secure by improving the situation of the population. Increasing security and military budgets in countries where the population is suffering from an acute food shortage is a disastrous move. Finally, I would like you to consider the fact that kidnapping and other crimes are a business in which many people are involved in a confusing array of organisations. Western funding for security structures could have a counterproductive effect on efforts to combat crime and could continue putting innocent people at risk in future.

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences. However, women’s rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions. The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women’s rights. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true. The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war. The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations. Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare. I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence.

 I absolutely agree with and support the tabled amendments, especially the ones on the delegated acts and restoring the European Parliament's right of scrutiny. But I abstained on the final vote on the Instrument (DCI) itself as, directly or indirectly, the African Peace Facility was funded through this instrument, and this funding was used inter alia for police and army training missions. I am of the opinion that development funding must not be used for any military or civil-military purposes. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, it is important to make clear at this point that, when it comes to the EU’s foreign policy financing instruments, the Treaty of Lisbon abolished the European Parliament’s right of supervision. In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service. I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union’s far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation. We support Parliament’s cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments. Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier. All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy.

 I condemn the mass rapes and serious violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the strongest possible terms. I very much welcome the inclusion and adoption of this condemnation in the joint motion for a resolution. I voted against the joint motion for a resolution, however, because, to a large extent, Congolese military and police units trained by the EU’s EUPOL and EUSEC missions since 2005 were, and are, also involved in these crimes. The joint motion for a resolution expressly supports and welcomes these training missions. I am in favour of the immediate cessation of these missions, as they have contributed in a negative way to the escalation of violence and to the situation in the country by training security forces that have been repeatedly involved in the serious violations of the human rights of the Congolese people. In addition, the army and police trained by the EU support the repressive apparatus of the corrupt Kabila regime. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in 2000, the European Union clearly stated in the Lisbon strategy its objective of becoming the leading economic power in the world by 2010. We have failed to meet this target in many areas, but not as far as arms exports from the EU are concerned. In the period from 2005 to 2009, the EU Member States overtook the United States and became the world’s leading arms exporters. I think that this development is highly questionable. Obviously, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was never legally binding and which included a restrictive export licensing practice, consisted of empty words. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was converted into a common position in December 2008. However, we still have no effective sanction mechanisms. For example, long before 2008, Germany recognised the Code of Conduct as being legally binding. Despite this, Germany is now the third largest arms exporter in the world and supplies arms to crisis regions such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In addition, the arms export reports which the Member States submit to the Council are not uniform and often not transparent. We urgently need standardisation in this area, so that all the relevant arms exports are traceable and can be subjected to critical evaluation. Unfortunately, almost no efforts are being made to standardise these reports. In any case, I doubt whether it is possible to have a system of ethically sound arms exports. However, one thing is certain and that is that the European Union is currently a very long way from achieving this.

 Unfortunately, the joint resolution’s recitals contain a positive reference to the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which I and my group reject. But due to the very high importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries I and the GUE/NGL group signed the joint resolution on the entry into force of the CCM and the role of the EU, as this joint resolution must be seen as a great success in order to ban cluster munitions. Sabine Lösing,

. – (DE) 
Madam President, I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions, which I expressly support. As already explained, cluster munitions are indeed among the most brutal weapons in existence. They were certainly still in use by some EU Member States and the USA until recently. I could mention the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. It is quite shocking that – as has already been stated – statistically, the victims of cluster bombs and cluster munitions are 98% civilians, 27% of whom are children. How are we to view the prospects for the continued use of these weapons? It is certainly remarkable that Deutsche Bank is investing in the production of these dreadful weapons through its subsidiaries. It has been proven that business relations exist between Deutsche Bank and leading suppliers and manufacturers of cluster munitions, including L-3 Communications and Lockheed Martin. I find it shameless and inhumane to knowingly seek to make money from the death of civilians. The use, production, storage and transport of these weapons must be prohibited; the same goes for the trade in such weapons. For this reason, all EU Member States, along with all other countries, must sign and ratify the agreement on cluster munitions in full by August of this year or, if this is not possible, as Mr Gahler has stated, they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity. There should also be a moratorium on the use, production and distribution of cluster munitions until the agreement is ratified and work should begin as quickly as possible to destroy the existing stockpiles of cluster munitions. I am very pleased with this cross-party cooperation and support for the agreement on cluster munitions in the form of this joint resolution and welcome it on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. We believe that this resolution represents a major success in the fight against these murderous weapons. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to make clear at this point that we are deeply concerned about the development of EU foreign policy towards militarisation and an increasingly interventionist policy. That is a dangerous development. I want to say, in all clarity, that we believe that a military approach to conflict resolution or to the supposed stabilisation of countries or regions is absolutely the wrong way to go to achieve greater security for the EU and the world. Military interventions – and Afghanistan, unfortunately, is a very current example of this – bring suffering, death and prolonged devastation, but no peace and no improvement in the situation as far as the resident population is concerned. The Danjean report lists what are referred to as key threats that constitute a challenge for the EU’s future security policy. One of these is climate change – something that has been overwhelmingly caused by the industrialised nations of the West. If people in the countries of the South have to take flight because they no longer have any water and food becomes scarcer and scarcer, they will represent a security problem for Europe. Such a view is cynical and inhuman. If States collapse as a result of neoliberal economic policy, they will constitute a security problem. What we need is not more military, it is a change, an end to the European Union’s neoliberal orientation. The European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the creation of a crisis management and planning directorate and the planned start-up fund to fund military operations are designed to make the EU a global player in military terms. We believe that moves towards centralisation in the European External Action Service are a dangerous and undemocratic development. The EU should assume a leading role in relation to demilitarisation and disarmament, especially in the field of nuclear disarmament. There needs to be a push for the obligation incumbent upon nuclear States under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which is to say, complete nuclear disarmament, to be honoured at long last. This was a key promise that constituted the basis on which many States signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and have, as a result, durably refrained from acquiring nuclear weapons. Reliable guarantees of non-aggression are the best means of preventing proliferation as, otherwise, countries threatened with intervention will attempt to deter such an attack by means of acquiring nuclear weapons. If nothing else, I would like, in this context, and in particular with regard to Iran, to point out and to warn that military operations or military activities of any kind to prevent proliferation are completely counter-productive and highly dangerous. We will be rejecting the Danjean report and have tabled our own resolution on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL
),

– I am fully aware that international nuclear disarmament, and therefore the strengthening of the NPT and its ratification by all states, are of vital importance and that every effort should be made to implement the treaty in all its aspects. To ensure effective multilateral efforts, they must be set within a well-developed vision of achieving a nuclear weapon-free world at the earliest date possible. We must insist on the commitment of the nuclear weapons states under Article VI of the NPT to disarm completely, as it was a key promise and so many countries have signed the NPT and thus forego nuclear weapons permanently. We oppose the phrase in this joint resolution (Recital G): ‘... making use of all instruments at its disposal to prevent ...’. I warn, in particular regarding Iran, that any military activity to prevent proliferation is completely counterproductive and highly dangerous. I am convinced that the best way to deal with the problem of proliferation would be to abandon atomic energy once and for all, as its civilian use bears great dangers on its own and, moreover, it cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty that civilian nuclear technology will not be used for military purposes.

 Mr President, we believe that the item on Madagascar is not particularly important today. We would therefore ask that that time slot be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Afro-American journalist who was found guilty of murdering a policeman in 1982, following a trial based on circumstantial evidence. Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years. Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated. In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know. Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January. The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever. We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.

Madam President, the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror. At this point in time, however, the strategic options for the US and the Member States of the EU in Yemen and the Horn of Africa region are not really open. The fact is that the ruling elites surrounding President Saleh brutally discriminate against and suppress the Shi’ite population in the north of the country and are waging a war against the separatist movement in the south, in the area of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, that is causing a great deal of suffering to the population there. There is no real provable connection to speak of between the Shi’ite population and al-Qaeda and this idea thus merely serves the corrupt and de facto
 autocratic government as a smoke-screen behind which to obtain massive military aid. Supporting this government to build up security forces should be avoided – doing so merely pours further oil on the fire. Any aid provided must benefit all the regions, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political orientation. A reconciliation process including the UN and all local players, including in the neighbouring states – such as Iran – must be initiated and promoted. We must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebels. Operation Atalanta should not be continued and expanded, and absolutely not onto the territory of the Yemeni mainland, because this would only serve the geostrategic interests of Western industrialised nations. We should focus all our efforts on ensuring that the EU does not go along with the US’s completely erroneous strategy of escalation in Yemen, too. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in no other country in the world have there, as yet, been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended. Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children? The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled – atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved. So what is being defended in the Congo? Humanity? Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people? President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms. This change was suspended when the war escalated once again. My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo – the FDLR – reputed to be in Germany?

) was voted and adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) in the European Parliament. This report is based on incorrect facts. The central point is that the report cites a judgment at first instance which has been repealed. The judgment is invalid, because the regional court in Munich http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=dismiss" ed http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=an" http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=action"  against Tobias Pflüger on 21 July 2009 in the second and final instance. A conviction was not made. For this reason, all reproaches are invalid. It is politically unacceptable that this report, which contains incorrect facts, was voted in Plenary today (24 November 2009). We have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken from the agenda, unfortunately without success. This kind of proceeding by the European Parliament creates the impression of supporting the persecution of politically active persons, in this case, the Munich II Public Prosecution Service against a former Member of the European Parliament.

Madam President, thank you for the report. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I questioned the competent representative of the Commission in a debate on the role of this agreement within the framework of EU immigration management. He clearly stated that, when it entered into force, it would pave the way for cooperation with the border security agency (Frontex) and for numerous immigration regulations, such as within the framework of readmission agreements and border security with Afghanistan. The 1 200 km long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has already been addressed here. It will then also become another target of the EU’s repressive policy to keep out refugees. Thus, the European Union wants to seal itself off from refugees far beyond its external borders. Yet again, we see that this is a fundamental component of EU foreign policy. As a result of such partnership agreements, refugees are interned in camps, in which, as we all know, inhumane conditions prevail, as is currently the case in Ukraine. The problem has already been addressed here in general terms. This form of so-called international immigration management involves serious infringement of the Geneva Refugee Convention and of international human rights. I therefore call on the EU to start fighting the cause of flight rather than the refugees. The European neighbourhood policy is one means of making fortress Europe even more impenetrable, which is why it is looked on very sceptically from our point of view, from the point of view of the GUE/NGL.

 Mr President, I think that this conflict is very often presented in a very one-sided manner. I agree with the previous speaker that in the present case it is frequently a matter of attacks on Han Chinese by Uighurs and indeed that some of these attacks are racially motivated. (Heckling)
 I read an interview with a Uighur woman, for example, who said: Would you like to be governed by yellow communists? The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region, for example they are allowed to have more children, they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples. Many of the local Han Chinese are also envious of them. We ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects. Sometimes problems do not lie where they seem to at first glance. We should be careful not to take a one-sided position. We ought to support the Chinese in solving their problems. The one-sided view that is so often presented in this House is, in my opinion, dangerous. The Chinese Government certainly has shortcomings in its policy towards minority groups and it has its failures too. However, it is also showing the will to improve in many areas. We should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation – and indeed also critical cooperation – based on trust. Sabine Wils,

Mr President, the most recent climate conferences have not produced any substantive improvements. The survival of the small island states and the least developed countries is still at risk from climate change. In Doha, the Green Climate Fund agreed in 2010 must be established, and a decision is also needed on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of 2012.  According to the World Bank, the global South needs USD 100 billion annually from 2014 to support adaptation to the impacts of climate change. It is clear that the industrialised countries must take responsibility for providing this funding. As long as the industrialised and emerging countries are at odds with each other and deploy blockading tactics, Doha will not produce any positive outcomes for the global climate. Climate protection must start at the national level and, in our case, at the European level as well.  The EU must increase its greenhouse reduction target for 2020 to 40 % against the 1990 baseline and make a firm and binding commitment to increase the share of renewables to 45 % by 2030.

Mr President, since it became clear that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy would each be preparing an own-initiative report, Parliament has been overrun by industry lobbyists. A whole string of shale gas events has been held since then here in this House, month after month, by the gas production companies – and with the active support of both conservative and liberal Members. There was only a single event here that was not organised by the disciples of fracking among us. This dominance of one-sided lobbying by financially powerful corporations should give us food for thought. It is unacceptable.  This perversion is particularly apparent when it comes to the subject of fracking. Companies want to protect their income; risks are played down and swept aside. Accidents are ruled out. Apparently we need shale gas for the energy transition. We are told the impact on the landscape will also be minimal, and so on. No, all this cannot hide the fact that fracking involves incalculable risks, is superfluous and only serves the profit interests of a small number of gas monopolists. I therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 4, in which the Member States are called upon not to approve any more fracking activities.

Mr President, I believe these lobbyists are holding this event to influence us MEPs. This event outside Parliament today, before tomorrow’s vote, is particularly blatant. I think that most people will also be unable to escape the arguments being made there, as they are supposedly objective arguments. Nevertheless, I do not wish to imply that of anyone. I find it striking, however, that the industry thinks it can make an impression here with its arguments. Yet certain statements that we are hearing are actually influenced by them. That is why I do not think it a good thing that we are allowed to be overrun by lobbyists in such a way here in Parliament. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Krahmer, to my mind an open debate involves a podium discussion to which both sides are invited, where opponents and advocates of fracking are both given the opportunity to speak.

As I said, just one event against fracking was held, involving a non-governmental organisation from the United States. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)).

 Mr President, it is time to put an end once and for all to the fact that, every year, tens of thousands of people in the EU die prematurely because of marine emissions. Outside the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), ships’ engines are more or less burning special waste. On this, the EU is lagging far behind the US and Canada, where only low sulphur fuel can be used in coastal areas. As far as I am concerned, this proposal to amend the directive represents a clear improvement, and this is partly down to the tenacity of the rapporteur. Better limit values are only half the battle, however. Equally as important is the fact that these are then implemented and enforced. There are certain loopholes, as a result of which it cannot be ruled out that shipowners will be able to evade the directive if, for example, a shipowner apparently proves that he is unable to store low sulphur fuels. It really comes down to the Member States and the Commission here. They must implement the regulations and impose painful penalties when necessary. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, in relation to the recast version of the first railway package, all the groups except my own appear to believe that more competition in the railway sector could be beneficial to citizens. In fact, the very opposite is the case. Or is all this perhaps really about securing profits for those private companies involved in the railway sector and bringing about a quick break-up and privatisation of what have, up to now, been national railways such as SNCF and Deutsche Bahn
? Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom, for example, shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy of liberalisation will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. The railway sector should not lose its economic, social and environmental role for the future, and therefore must not be broken up into individual free-market radical, profit-focused parts. My group is therefore on the side of the trade unions and clearly in favour of the idea of retaining integrated railway companies, which have crucial experience and skills, in public hands. These companies not only provide social security for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased volumes of rail traffic in future. In the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the majority from the other groups essentially followed the Commission proposal for a further liberalisation and privatisation of the railway sector. It remains unclear what competences the national rail supervisory authorities and the new EU regulatory body would each have in relation to safety matters. In any case, the safety of rail traffic must be prioritised above the supervision of competition rules. In Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the idea was always in the background that the fourth railway package would also herald the separation of networks and operators. This, too, is something that my group will resolutely oppose. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the fundamental tenor of the Commission’s proposal and of the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in relation to the Energy Taxation Directive would facilitate the uniform handling of all sources of energy by 2023 by following a technically neutral approach with a minimum tax rate for all traded fuels and electricity, based on CO2
 and energy content. At the same time, incentives would be established for the use of less polluting energy products for the transition to a low carbon economy. The proposed directive would provide three important tax incentives: firstly, for the reduction of CO2
 emissions, secondly, for the saving of energy, and thirdly, for the promotion of a changeover to more energy-efficient fuels and more environmentally sound energy production. The adjustment for diesel fuel to bring it into line with the taxation of petrol could place pressure on the motor industry to develop more energy-efficient engines. In the United Kingdom, both fuels are already taxed to the same level. The EU’s objective of minimum taxation establishes equal conditions for all. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the current vote on the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050 is of central importance. The lack of ambition in relation to European climate protection policy threatens the sustainable development of Europe’s economy. Dirty technologies, such as nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, are impeding a change in energy policy. The EU emissions trading system has so far failed as an instrument for climate protection and is undermining European climate protection policy. It shows that market-based instruments are not the way to combat climate change. Long-term climate protection means identifying binding targets for renewable energies and for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Binding interim steps for 2030 and 2040 as part of the move away from the use of carbon in economic activity by 2050 will give industry some certainty in relation to planning. Ambitious climate protection with a long-term goal of 95% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels will promote innovation and create new jobs in the area of renewable technologies.

 Mr President, the Member States and the industrialised nations have been living beyond their means for many years. It is nothing new when I tell you that we can only enjoy a lifestyle like this at the expense of the poorer countries of the world. The WEEE Directive addresses at least part of the problem. The open area of application is of decisive importance. This approach can and should set an example in terms of environmental legislation. I am pleased that a collection target of 85% has been set, particularly because the Council held out stubbornly for lower targets for a long time. I constantly find myself saying: Parliament needs to flex its muscles. After all, people will only invest in environmentally-friendly technologies and innovation will only be encouraged if legislators speed up their work. With this in mind, I also welcome the fact that solar modules are not to be excluded from the directive. It was right not to rely on a voluntary, self-imposed commitment by the manufacturers. All too often in the past, Parliament has bowed to pressure and given in to such deals. These deals have also often proven to be just another way for the industry to drag its heels. Nonetheless, I do not agree with the way the directive deals with nanomaterials. It is essential that waste equipment containing nanomaterials should be dealt with separately. The report simply invites the Commission to investigate whether this is to continue to happen in the future, however. This is an extraordinarily weak formulation that is not worth a great deal. Nanomaterials can be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear indicators stating that they are damaging to health. I am therefore calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. Overall, however, I am satisfied with the results in this context. The perseverance of Parliament in its negotiations with the Council has paid off. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for this. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the obvious point of the new version of the first railway package is to secure profits for private businesses in the rail sector. The integrated public railway companies are to be destroyed by allowing subcontracts to be awarded and marshalling yards and maintenance works to be privatised and operated by private businesses from outside the railway industry. Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. I strongly oppose the suggestion from the Right in Parliament, contrary to the majority opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that the right to strike should be removed by invoking the vital services principle. The railway sector is an integrated network that cannot be divided up into radical free-market, profit-oriented parts. We must not allow this to happen because it must remain possible to control the railway sector in a social, economic and ecological context into the future. It is for this reason that my group sides with the unions and clearly favours the retention of the integrated railway companies in public hands. These companies not only provide social stability for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased transport volumes. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, I am outraged. The stress tests for nuclear power plants in the EU give the operators an alibi to continue running their reactors and are intended to conceal the actual danger represented by the so-called residual risks, in particular, if the power plants do not have to be shut down when the results of the stress tests are negative. The failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures. Radioactive radiation does not stop at national borders. In order to protect the people of Europe and its neighbouring countries, the EU should develop a Europe-wide exit strategy, call on its neighbours to get out of nuclear power as part of its neighbourhood policy and, in this way, prevent new nuclear power stations from being built. The prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the Euratom Treaty, which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry. In the past, loans of more than EUR 500 million have been made available to Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine alone for the construction of new nuclear power stations. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the EHEC epidemic is making apparent the flaws in the system of industrial food production in the liberalised Internal Market of the EU. When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers. So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection. In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders. After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear. If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited. As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food. However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety. Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from. The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic. In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside. The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation. We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy. Our food must be safe. However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks. The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, following the disaster of Chernobyl 25 years ago, new investigations by the Society for Radiation Protection show that to date 1.4 million people have died from the long-term consequences of the nuclear meltdown. Even in Germany we feared for the safety of our children, as they were exposed to radioactive rain clouds and contaminated foodstuffs. The EU must now take the right steps in responding to the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. The fears that the promised stress tests for all nuclear power plants would simply provide an excuse for the continued operation of reactors have unfortunately proven to be well-founded in the light of the stress criteria announced. Other nuclear facilities will not be examined. Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population. We are calling for extensive, binding stress tests carried out by independent experts. However this can only be the first step on the way to a Europe-wide nuclear exit scenario. Sabine Wils

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal waste exports and the illegal disposal of waste pose an increasing threat to the health and environment of millions of people in developing countries. The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU. Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs. I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue. The legal loopholes that permit these hazardous exports must be closed. The existing regulations on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced. We need a legislative proposal for environmental inspections, something that Parliament already called for in 2008, so that ships can be inspected effectively by the authorities in the local ports. This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law. We propose that this should be reinforced in a joint resolution by all sides of the House. The entry of waste into the EU must also be better controlled. Off the coast of Calabria, just a few miles away from the port of Cetraro, there is a sunken vessel known for carrying highly toxic waste. It is assumed that many other toxic waste transporters have been sunk just off the coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea. This example illustrates the need for transparency in the shipment of waste and for reliable official inspections. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, there have recently been demonstrations in Germany in which 250 000 people called for an immediate exit from nuclear power and a changeover to 100% renewable energy. Both of these things are possible. After Chernobyl and Fukushima, it is clear that nuclear power will always involve a residual risk. Therefore, it must be mandatory for the nuclear safety standards throughout Europe to be based on the best available technologies. Despite the adoption of the Council Directive concerning the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009, the existing safety standards remain in place in the Member States. Therefore, we urgently need a revision of this directive with the involvement of Parliament under the codecision procedure which is not based on the Euratom Treaty. I want to see an initiative involving as many of the groups in Parliament as possible which will call on the Council and the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to this effect. I believe that we need a nuclear exit scenario covering the whole of Europe. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown. Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically. This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power. That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price. For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance. Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States. The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty. Billions in taxpayers’ money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin discussing light commercial vehicles, I would like to remind you that European car manufacturers have achieved the EU’s CO2
 product targets for cars several years before the deadline in 2015, by taking the appropriate technical measures. It is now clear that the manufacturers were seriously exaggerating during the negotiations on the time period and the targets for the CO2
 reduction measures for cars when these were subsequently watered down. The manufacturers have taken the same approach in their lobbying activities concerning the CO2
 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles. I would like to know how a majority here in Parliament can knowingly repeat this mistake and give in once again to the demands of the automotive industry. In this era of climate change, I believe that the important issues are protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the human race. If Parliament would at least support the Commission’s proposal, this would put the European automotive industry at the cutting edge of technical development and, therefore, allow it to remain competitive. The Commission proposed a reduction target of 135 grams of CO2
 per kilometre. Following a transition period, the manufacturers would not be required to reach this limit until 2020. In my opinion, that would have been feasible. Instead of this, under pressure from the Council, a poor compromise was reached behind closed doors, according to which car manufacturers must now reduce the CO2
 emissions of light commercial vehicles to only 197 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. This feeble compromise is a gift to the industry. Super-credits, phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further. Lobbying by manufacturers among Members of this House and pressure from the vehicle manufacturing countries, namely Germany, France and Italy, in the Council have produced this poor result, which contains a whole series of loopholes. This report is unacceptable. It conflicts with the climate objectives of the EU and will slow down the pace of technical innovation. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will be voting against this report. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically. Millions of tonnes of electric and electronic waste are produced in the EU every year and this represents a genuine hazard for people and the environment. I am pleased that the report by Mr Florenz recognises this problem and that we were able to introduce some pleasing improvements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which had the support of all the groups. The stricter export regulations for electric and electronic waste are important. I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected. However, I still do not agree with the exclusion of solar modules from the directive. I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers. A few manufacturers use cadmium, which is a toxic substance, in their solar modules. The fact that modules are frequently removed by do-it-yourself enthusiasts presents an additional risk. Nanomaterials can also be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear instructions stating that they are damaging to health. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. This is why we have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I would like to ask you to support them. These are Amendments 101 and 102.

 Mr President, the draft directive on patient mobility could quickly lead to healthcare in the EU being reduced to the level of the lowest common denominator, by means of a service-based approach. My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers. The proposed directive will enable health insurance companies to send patients abroad for cheaper treatment. This will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector. If a specific treatment is available more cheaply a few hundred kilometres away, and if patients are sent there by their insurance companies, the result will be that this particular treatment will no longer be available locally. Therefore, the health sector will simply be following the neoliberal logic of the market, instead of giving priority to patients’ welfare. I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to see health tourism in this sensitive sector. I am in favour of patients receiving healthcare close to where they live. This is a public responsibility as part of the provision of services of general interest, which must be available for everyone in their local area. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, grinding, mixing, cheating – these are the three buzzwords of the feed industry in Germany. Since 1999, there have been five dioxin scandals in Germany alone. Feed manufacturers and large food companies are clearly not concerned about EU directives and national legislation when it comes to making large profits with cheap food. Competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in Germany. Feed for intensive livestock farming is therefore intended to be as cheap as possible. State checks are rarely carried out on feed and food producers. The state has increasingly relied on self checking by the manufacturer and saved itself the expense of employing qualified staff. Under these conditions, technical fat waste contaminated with dioxins was able to find its way into the feed and foodstuffs chain. The current dioxin scandal could have been prevented if the fat had been tested for dioxins before it was mixed into the feed. The contamination would then have been detected in time. Numerous consumers have now been contaminated with additional dioxins once again. Eighty percent of our intake of dioxins enters our bodies via foodstuffs of animal origin – in other words, meat, milk and eggs. Foodwatch is rightly demanding that feed manufacturers be placed under obligation to test every batch of feed ingredients for dioxins and PCBs before they mix the feed. Absolutely no ingredients that do not comply with the limit values may be included in the feed. Highly contaminated batches must be destroyed, and it must be possible to prove that this has indeed been done. That is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminants. Laboratories must also be placed under obligation to report cases where the limit values are exceeded to the national supervisory authorities. We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability. The current and previous food scandals in Germany have shown that routine state checks on the feed manufacturers and animal producers are essential. How do you intend to implement that Commissioner?

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the climate conference in Cancún must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation. As part of an alliance of responsibility, the EU must demonstrate political leadership, regardless of what the United States does, and allow itself to be judged by the principle of climate justice. This means that there must be a second commitment period for the industrialised nations under the Kyoto Protocol. Additional funds must be provided for financing climate measures. With regard to long-term financing, the EU must lay its cards on the table in the negotiations. The EU must present ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases. The global temperature must under no circumstances increase by more than 1.5°C. This target will result in technical innovations and create jobs at a time of economic crisis. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a good job and salvaged what was possible in the face of great resistance from the Council and the majority here in Parliament. One major success of the new version is the open scope. This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it. On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC. Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force. Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs. We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly. Leading manufacturers are showing us the way. Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times. It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result. After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them. The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, biocides form part of many cleaning products, disinfectants, insect sprays and other everyday products which people come into contact with in the course of their daily lives. There are currently more than 50 000 biocide products in the European Union. I would like to make it perfectly clear to everyone that biocides are mainly used by private citizens. Biocides are often non-biodegradable, in some cases, carcinogenic, highly toxic substances, and can cause harm to people, animals and the environment when they are being used and disposed of. People and young children in particular are especially at risk when biocides are used in the home, for example, in the form of wood preservatives and insect sprays. It is true that the manufacturers say that their products are not hazardous if they are used properly. However, given that 400 000 tonnes of biocides are sold to and used by private individuals in the EU every year, it is important that improper use and the occurrence of accidents are taken into consideration. As this has not yet been the case, I have tabled an amendment on this subject and I would ask you vote in favour of it. This is Amendment 352. Should the purpose of this regulation be to increase the free circulation of biocidal products within the European Union as the Commission has proposed? Or is this House more concerned with protecting people and the environment? It is essential that we introduce a strict ban on particularly hazardous substances. We must make a decision which supports the cause of consumers, otherwise we will be putting people’s health at risk. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, two phases of postal service liberalisation have already been implemented. The Commission has not, as yet, published a single study dealing solely with social conditions and the impact on postal workers of the opening up of the market. My question to you, Commissioner Barnier, is when will this study be made available to Parliament at long last? Yesterday, we heard from numerous postal workers from several EU Member States that entire workforces are already being dismissed by the new postal companies and re-employed under poorer conditions. Competition and competition policy must not be played out at the expense of the workers. If the Commission and Parliament really want to do something to combat poverty and exclusion in the EU, the third phase of the postal service liberalisation must now be discontinued. The consequences for postal workers and the quality of the universal service must first be investigated. We therefore call for a moratorium on the third phase of postal service liberalisation for the sake of customers and postal workers. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the United Nations climate conference failed due to the hard-nosed political interests of the industrialised nations. As a result, the basis for existence of billions of people in developing countries and in the island nations at risk of being submerged is in jeopardy. There is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet. The EU played the game in the interests of its national undertakings and the profits of the large concerns. The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States by a total of 30% by 2020 was not brought to the table early enough. Making better climate protection targets dependent on the prior concessions of other States is playing dice with the future of humanity. The facts are clear: in 2007, CO2
 emissions per person were 4.6 tonnes in China, in Germany they were 9.7 tonnes and in the US 19.1 tonnes. We urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity. Next year in Mexico City, the industrialised nations and emerging economies must come to a binding agreement with specific and ambitious targets. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in many parts of the world the consequences of climate change are visible. The most recent calculations assume a global temperature rise of up to 4° C by 2060, and up to 10° C in the Arctic. It is primarily Europe’s soot emissions that are responsible for the significantly faster melting of the ice in the Arctic – they are borne there by the wind. The rich industrial States of the EU are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change. USD 100 billion will be needed every year from 2010 to 2050. Of that amount, it is fair to say that USD 30 billion is not too much for the European Union. The transfer of technology must also not be linked to patents, or else some of the money will simply be flowing straight back to the corporations in the industrialised countries. The EU has an obligation to take a lead at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy. When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care. How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half? How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester? I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs. On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece. I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what should worry us and make us panic is not simply the sheer numbers of unemployed young people in Europe, but the way this is developing. Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation. It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living. If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities. I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity. When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis. In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe’s economy. We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies. That would be the right approach. Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people. I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70. We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market. That is what I am urgently calling for. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speculation was a major factor in triggering the crisis, while credit default swaps (CDSs) and short selling have been a major factor in heightening the crisis. These instruments have degenerated into purely speculative instruments. Some people in the financial sector seem to have incorrectly regarded or misused these instruments as a personal licence to print money. As a result, entire economies have suffered, along with nation states and, above all, the people of the countries concerned. To this extent, the fact that the Commission has finally taken the initiative and realised that regulation is necessary is to be welcomed. Whether or not the regulation will be strict remains to be seen. I expressly welcome the work and the efforts by the rapporteur, Mr Canfin, to improve the regulation tabled and to put a stop to the gambling. What is needed is a de facto
 ban on naked short selling and the prevention of speculation in the future. We also need strict regulation and, above all, a strong supervisory authority in Europe. I fear, however, that as the negotiations continue, the interests of the financial centres – London and Frankfurt in particular – will override the interests of the majority of the people of Europe. If that happens we will be left with little more than a Swiss cheese in which the holes are probably larger than what is left. That is quite definitely not something my group could support.

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint. It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do. On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation. Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households. This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers. Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission. The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers. For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support. I would like to comment on four points. Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention. If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place. Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area. Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights. Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector. I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions. This is a good thing. We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, public procurement law and the awarding of public contracts are an essential part of the internal market. Mr Barnier, my response to your remarks about wanting to promote social integration in this context is that I have heard very little about protecting social rights or about protecting collective agreements. These are some of the fundamental rules which you, as you have said, do not want to call into question. If we want to protect the fundamental rules, we must ensure in future, during the process of awarding public contracts, that basic social standards are maintained, that collective agreements are not undermined, and that the use of cheap labour is prevented. All of this forms part of modern public procurement law. I would like to make it clear that we must no longer put greater emphasis on economic freedoms and free competition than on fundamental social rights. Either we want a social Europe or we want permanent conflict with the people who are turning away from Europe because it does not protect their interests. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too. Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity. I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prosperity of a country is created through the work of its people. In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid. People want proper, secure pensions in their old age. One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable. In contrast, occupational and private pension funds have lost millions of euro on the stock exchange. It is ridiculous to increase the focus on private, capital-based pension systems when providing for people’s retirement. The public has financed the rescue packages for the major banks. The people are paying for a tough austerity policy which is under the control of the European Union. Now, they are supposed to turn around national budgets by taking cuts in their pensions and accepting a higher retirement age. Previous pension reforms are already leading to increasing poverty in old age. The only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension systems. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition. However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider. In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition. The report sets down pointers for the Commission’s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe. Thomas Händel,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs. That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family. The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain. Women, in particular, have been affected by this. The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women. Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions. Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation. Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘good work’ principles. All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers. The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal for integrated guidelines for more and better jobs has been significantly improved by the work of Parliament. Despite a number of improvements, we are still a long way from achieving our goals. We do not deny the fact that improvements have been made with regard to the equality of men and women, but it would have been better to integrate a separate guideline into this set of guidelines. We will request this very forcefully in plenary tomorrow. Secondly, it is important that the evaluation of the results and the reporting obligations are firmly established within Parliament’s sphere of competence and that there are now more exacting objectives and sub-goals with regard to labour market participation and active labour market policy in the report. However, it would be important for Parliament to confirm tomorrow that the ILO principles relating to good and decent work as well as the question of a minimum income that is clearly above the poverty line are taken into consideration in the report. I am, however, of the opinion that this report still has a number of shortcomings. It is far too reminiscent of the old Lisbon strategy. The failed flexicurity principles have been repeated like a mantra and much of the wording smacks of the old deregulation policy. Secondly, if principles such as the compatibility of work and family life, social cohesion, sustainable economic management, investments and education are mentioned but there are no specific measures to follow this, it represents a weakness in the report. For more and better employment, it would be necessary to place the focus on reducing the precariousness of the current situation and to emphasise the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same place’, to make the model of full-time employment the central focus once again, to limit the maximum working week and consider reducing working hours and, above all, with regard to cohesion, to incorporate social progress as a mandatory element and not permit any backward steps.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the responsibility in this European Parliament to regulate the financial markets firmly. All the proposals we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues. The Council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights. Mr Giegold is right when he described what is currently going on as ‘parochial’. The intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations, but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down. We will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets. Inadequate conclusions are being drawn from this financial and economic crisis, which means that the next crisis is already brewing. Many national economies, including those in Europe, will not withstand the blows to come, with all the social and economic repercussions this entails for people living in Europe. They are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored. If the CEO of UniCredit Bank, Alessandro Profumo, says as he did at the weekend that we need a strong, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority and a common set of rules for all Member States, calling for tighter capital rules, this is an appeal to this Parliament to actually draw up these rules. It is this European Parliament’s job to exert pressure on the Council and enforce effective regulation as a matter of urgency. This would be just the first step to a status quo ante
. It is finally time for the grandiose promises to be backed up by actions. My group supports strong European regulation. Any other situation, without regulations, would pose a danger to the euro, a single EU and democracy. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months. I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths? What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work. As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘Let’s see what happens’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious. My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence. Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House! Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model. It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority. I therefore call on Europe’s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures. That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty. Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe’s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports. However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it. Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation. What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme – at best, it is a nanofinance programme! Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out. Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable. Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme. Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect. Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way. In this form, we will reject this programme. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share much of what the Commission has put forward here on the causes and the prospects for the car industry – overcapacities, the need to change strategy, new technologies. However, I would like to point out that there are a number of things that we do not share. Opel will probably not be the last case in the car industry, where there is 30% overcapacity across the globe. We are not only talking about the approximately 12 million people who directly or indirectly live off this industry but the roughly 30 million people throughout Europe who are involved in this industry’s economic output. In this situation, the Commission shares responsibility for ensuring that the European car industry is able to master this challenge. The Commission also shares responsibility for ensuring that Opel does not now become the sacrificial pawn of a free-market clean-up of the crisis. The necessary re-alignment of the management of free market forces in this Union will not automatically balance the anticipated job losses with new jobs. On the contrary, indeed, those in jobs and European national economies will pay the price. The general prevention of State aid will lead to the advent not only of distortions of competition but also social distortions. These will then take a much bigger toll on the coffers of the affected countries than they can afford and, above all, much more than those coffers would be burdened by the aid currently being offered, when you include the dismantlement of social services. The restructuring of the European car industry needs strong initiatives from the Commission, but also from the relevant national governments. We therefore propose a European industry council on the future of mobility involving politicians, businesses, trade unions and academics. It would have to develop possible courses of action for the necessary technical changes and define political measures and the associated funding. Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens. That applied years ago to the steel industry, and it must now apply to Opel and to the car industry in Europe as a whole. State aid can and, in my view, must also be linked to achieving an institutionalised employee participation with extended rights of codecision. All affected employees in Europe need security for their sites, they need new work and new, secure future prospects across Europe.Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament’s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live. In my view, the Council’s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament. Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive. We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored. We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights. The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council. I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last! Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, this is a never-ending story. I have lost count of the times we have discussed it here. It is a shameful situation that it takes an oral question today to elicit information from the Commission about what it plans to do next with regard to data retention. Let me be frank: instead of deluding itself, the Commission should stop playing games and should face up to reality. That includes admitting that data retention has failed.  The Commission’s aim of establishing uniform rules is quite simply misguided. One reason is that some Member States, due to their constitutional arrangements, are not in a position to transpose the European Directive. What’s more, we have a patchwork of arrangements in the other countries which have transposed the Directive. Some countries store data for six months, others for a year. Some only use the data when investigating serious crime; others use the data to investigate minor delictions. It is a terrible mess, and I do not think we have ever seen anything like it. Now you are taking action against the German Government by referring the matter to the European Court of Justice. Curiously, you argue that Germany’s failure to transpose the Directive is likely to have a negative effect on the internal market and on the ability of the German police to investigate and prosecute serious crime. What did you get that from? How did you come up with that? No one can possibly know whether that claim is true. In fact, studies have revealed a very different picture. The available information includes not only the judgments of the courts and related studies. They also include activity reports such as those produced by the German Bundestag’s Research Services, which is genuinely above suspicion. In 2011, the Research Services found no significant evidence that data retention offers any benefits for the investigation of crime. The reports such as that produced by the Max Planck Institute in 2012 are also beyond reproach. That report states that data retention is of no use whatsoever in the investigation of murders, robberies, child pornography and internet crime. Let me say this, Ms Malmström. If the Commission has nothing new to contribute here, you should at least suspend the Directive pending the judgment of the European Court of Justice. Aside from that, we are calling for a Europe-wide ban on the retention of communications data where there is no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Voss, data retention does not solve any problems. In fact, it is the problem. Let me offer an analogy. Not long ago, I was walking through my home city of Dresden and happened to spot a burglar breaking into a house. Let me ask you this: would you now act on this information by passing a directive which states that women in my age group should stroll through Europe’s cities at night in order to reduce the crime rate? I think we should be asking about the benefits of the Directive. We are nearing the end of this debate and I have just one point to make. Instead of flogging a dead horse – to use your analogy – and filching millions of people’s data, I would suggest that we proceed as follows. Ms Malmström, perhaps you could offer different advice to the Interior Ministers of the EU Member States. You could tell them not to make cuts in the police or law enforcement agencies in their countries. You could tell them to provide decent training for the police and the judiciary and to tackle corruption, which is now widespread. If we manage to achieve that in our countries, we would be making a valuable contribution to combating crime, which would greatly benefit citizens. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, we really ought to speak plainly and clearly today, and this plain-speaking includes the fact that we cannot turn the clock back, and nor do we want to. As Parliament, we have the right under the Treaty to be involved in decisions on all matters relating to Schengen and not just to be casually consulted. That is something that I would like to make clear at the start. I would also like to say that this EU law simply must not be left to the arbitrariness of political freebooters – and that is how I would describe it. Politically motivated contravention – and that is also the term I would choose to use – using the Schengen agreement as a kind of muscle-flexing in election campaigns, is totally unacceptable, and also has nothing to do with EU law. These problems do not only include arbitrary border closures, which we had for a time and which, of course, violate EU law, they also include the installation of cameras at 15 border crossings between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium. If these do not also constitute border controls, then what are they? Furthermore, all that nonsense from a German interior minister concerning the reintroduction of border controls is obviously dangerous. It is dangerous not just because of the problems with Schengen, but also because it represents the arguments of the extreme right, and not just in Germany. Equally unacceptable is the fact that, at the border between Germany and the Czech Republic, which is, incidentally, where I live, buses are constantly being checked. We must not tolerate this. It is not only buses from the Czech Republic that are being checked, but people who look a bit different in some way, for example those who have slightly darker skin, are also being checked. This is also part of the problem. Let us make it very clear that this is not acceptable. We do not want this, because it contravenes the law and because, as Parliament, we do not want this sort of policy. We therefore also express our criticism of the Council’s action in the strongest possible terms. After all, this is not merely a contravention of the law; it is also undemocratic. I therefore suggest that the Council discusses four things with us: Firstly, we ought to be in agreement that there must be no arbitrariness in the way that the Schengen Agreement is implemented. That is something I would like to discuss. Secondly, we want to increase free movement. We want to talk about this. Thirdly, in the event of contraventions of the Schengen Agreement, we want the Commission, with the involvement of the Council, to draw the necessary conclusions. Lastly, as Parliament, we want to be fully involved in all matters, and that includes decision making. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is clear that this is not about individual facts which we have to discuss but about the fundamental issue of our attitude to democracy and civil liberties. When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do. These are the reasons why millions of people have taken to the streets and have long since anticipated the vote on ACTA. There has already been a vote on ACTA on the streets, on the Internet and in relation to the Committee on Petitions in many countries, not only inside but also outside the EU. I believe that we must not ignore this vote. It is a demonstration of direct democracy by the many citizens who elected us. I can only say that we should put ACTA to one side. That is the only decent thing to do. Cornelia Ernst,

 Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, the EU’s open borders represent the most important symbol of the Union around the world, and they have a deep allure to many people across the globe. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as you know, have always criticised the fact that the EU is also associated with fencing off the outside at the same time. That is precisely the reason why it was so important to us to retain a built-in European emergency mechanism, but the Council was up in arms about that idea. I can only say to you that what you are doing here, what you, the Council, are celebrating, is troglodytic. Go back to the basic principles of the Community! I beg you to do that! Put an end to this kind of, ultimately, anti-European politics. Ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Council in this case is anti-democratic, as it seeks to downgrade Parliament to the status of a consulted body. We will not tolerate this, however. We have it in writing, we have a Treaty right to codecision, and we intend to – and will – exercise that right. My second point is that the Council’s decision is deeply anti-European because it nationalises Schengen. I ask you, the Council, the Danish Presidency: do you want to bring back the customs borders? Do you want to go back to the 19th century? What signs are you hoping to send to the outside world with this decision? You are making yourselves look ridiculous to the world, and to Europe. My third point is that this decision by the Council is populist, in the truest sense of the word, and provides a boost to the forces of nationalism, exactly those people who want to retreat to the nations and destroy the Europe that we have built. We cannot settle for that. I appeal to you to take back your decision, and be Europeans again! Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I believe that we are faced with a very sensitive issue when we come to talk about residence restrictions, particularly because this gives a push to right-wing populist and extremist forces. When we see the populist right-wing Swiss People’s Party successfully campaigning for a referendum on the issue of quotas for non-nationals, then we find ourselves on the horns of a dilemma. There is something that I want to state clearly on behalf of our group: neither EU citizens nor anyone else should be allowed to become political footballs or the object of cheap right-wing propaganda as a result of so-called mass immigration, in this case involving Switzerland. The problem is particularly difficult because it relates to European citizens. If we look at who obtains the largest number of residence permits, we find that over two-thirds are EU citizens. In April 2012, the Swiss authorities, in a hasty response, decided to introduce quotas for certain countries. If we take a closer look, we can see a contradiction here: if we consider the breakdown for residence permits as a whole, then we find that most are granted to Germans and Italians, not Czechs or Poles. The proportion of nationals from the eight countries in question is really relatively small and yet the 10 % rule is being invoked, something quite ridiculous in comparison with citizens of other countries. This again shows what happens when one deals with such questions in terms of percentages. You soon find yourself falling into a huge trap, as I would remind you. It is politically dubious and counterproductive for Switzerland to invoke the agreement with the EU, referring to Article 10(4). We see this as a violation of the directive on the freedom of movement and the agreement with Switzerland and, above all, we consider it as discrimination against specific citizens and Member States. That must not be allowed to happen. We need equal treatment for all EU citizens, including in relation to Switzerland. We must be absolutely clear about this. For this reason, we refuse on principle to discuss quotas here, as they actually fan the flames of xenophobia. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, firstly, either there are uniform EU visa rules and a binding reciprocity mechanism for all Member States, in which case the Commission – as Guardian of the Treaties – must fight hard for these to be implemented, or there are not, in which case the Commission has already been tolerating a two-tier system for EU citizens for many years, and my group considers that absolutely unacceptable. We demand that the Commission resolves this problem without delay and prior to concluding the agreement with Canada. Otherwise, the reciprocity mechanism must apply. That is my first point. At the same time, however, we have to take ourselves seriously, which leads me to ask whether the new visa regulation will at least strengthen the reciprocity mechanism? Is that the case? Can we in fact prevent such practices as have occurred in relation to Canada from occurring again in future? The only thing I can say to that is: by no means. What has emerged, however, is that visa policy continues to be used as a means of exerting pressure against migration. As my third point, can we please talk for once about the population group that is often meant when we talk about the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. It is the Roma. Many Roma have gone to Canada, and the Czech Republic argues that Canada is itself to blame for this because Canada has for years created incentives for high levels of immigration through its generous and tolerant asylum policy. That is Canada’s argument, and they are doing nothing to counter this. On the contrary, they go so far as to support it by saying: well, how is it that EU citizens are even able to go to third countries and claim asylum? Indeed, why is that? It is because the Roma have miserable living conditions in the EU – a situation of which we have been aware for many years, in which they are so discriminated against and excluded that it is no wonder that people are going to countries such as Canada. To me, this issue is also a kind of Lex Roma
; and to that extent, if we really want to do something about it, if we want to prevent emigration, then we have to improve conditions at home. That is what we should be looking at. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left intends voting against this agreement because it nullifies an elementary right of EU citizens, namely the right to the protection of personal data. Ms Malmström, I can only shake my head in despair at what you have had to say. You seem to be chasing an imaginary level of security that does not exist and that will not come into existence with this agreement or any other agreement of this kind. We are not talking about a small amount of travel information about European citizens, but rather about the combination of this information with other long-established databases, enabling profiling and thus the monitoring of individual citizens. We reject this agreement because no adequate evidence has been provided – not even by you, Ms Malmström – of the possible benefits of this agreement. We also oppose it because proportionality and purpose limitation are taken to absurd lengths when millions of data records belonging to innocent citizens are retained. We reject it because the use of this data goes far beyond the purpose you have indicated – the fight against terrorism and the combating of serious, organised, cross-border crime. Article 4 contains an escape clause that also needs to be discussed. This clause significantly widens the purpose for which data can be used. We cannot support this agreement because it involves the processing and forwarding of the PNR data to an authority, the Department of Homeland Security, where the intelligence services hold power, and even to third countries; none of this can be controlled by Parliament, so that there is no guarantee of transparency. We reject the agreement because the period for which the data is to be retained goes against all understanding of proportionality and appropriateness, whereby even sensitive data can be retained for 30 days and possibly even longer. This is scandalous. It is quite impossible for our group to vote in favour because there is no serious provision for judicial remedy. The judicial remedy provisions contained in the agreement are laughable. All that is offered is a limited right to information and it is not even possible to take legal recourse according to a proper data protection law. This is just not possible. Judicial remedy is transformed into the obstruction of justice. To Mr Voss and the other Members who intend voting in favour of this agreement I would say: if our own EU Treaties mean anything to us, then we must reject this agreement. It is all a question of responsibility, Mr Voss, namely responsibility to the citizens of the European Union. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, our group supported the call at the time of the last amendment to the Biometric Passports Regulation in 2009 for a review to be carried out in three years’ time and for four studies to be presented. One of the reasons that our group supported this was because it has expressed major concerns time and again on the grounds of data protection and also on account of the overestimation of the benefit of using biometric data in passports. The belief in the perfect form of identification, the overestimation of this method too, and – associated with this – the overestimation of other parts of the security chain are genuinely problematic. The use of biometric data is still subject to this major misconception, namely the assumption that these data are unchangeable and mostly reliable. That is absolutely not the case. These data are also subject to change throughout a person’s life. They differ between childhood and old age. We therefore need reliable and sound studies and conclusions. People are still busily forging these documents. We have now been able to establish this. As the incidents in the United Kingdom and other countries repeatedly demonstrate, the chips are definitely not safe from misuse. They are readily cracked and, for those concerned, this can result in permanent damage. The standards within the EU also differ widely. The error rate – as seen in France and the Netherlands – is very high. We need to ask ourselves again and again what benefit we get from biometric data if documents are falsified and enter into circulation. Thus, if one part of the chain is falsified and the ‘breeder’ documents are at variance, biometric data would no longer be of any help to us. The Chaos Computer Club in Germany needed a few minutes only to demonstrate the falsification of a chip. For this, the people of the Chaos Computer Club needed the cap of a plastic bottle, some superglue, a digital camera and a little wood glue, and in a few minutes they had cracked the chip. So much for supposed security. We are waiting for the Commission to present the studies and, of course, also the results and the lessons that can be drawn from them. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, has anyone in this Parliament actually ever written a report about the number of men in middle and top positions who are mediocre, low-achievers? Had there been such a report, it would have observed – as we already know from our real lives – that a great number of men who really are not effective and not particularly brilliant nevertheless occupy top positions. We would also have hit upon the idea that perhaps the factor of excellence in performance, which is supposed to be the sole criterion for top positions, is not, in fact, the only factor. There is a glass ceiling for women, also known as structural discrimination, and as long as that is the case, we will need this quota. It is very crude tool: all the quota does is to create formal equality, which is the prerequisite for bringing about real equality of rights and fairness between the sexes. It seems to me that we should not beat around the bush, we should give this our clear support and I am therefore nailing my colours to the mast in support of this quota. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am still somewhat astonished. After years of Mr Barroso and his colleagues in the Council having pursued a policy of austerity, and successfully having forced upon everyone unemployment and cuts in social security spending under the umbrella of the crisis, they have now discovered the unemployed. As important as this subject certainly is, it sounds like mockery if you see the promotional film for it on EuroparlTV, which talks about additional funding. I have a simple question for you, Mr Hahn, namely, where in your petty cash can you find EUR 82 billion? We all know that everything is actually already planned up to 2013 – and we are not far from the point where that door will be closing. We should not be dealing in tricks, nor should we be talking as if everyone could now receive the same funding or indeed adequate funding. Quite specifically, what is the situation with Ireland, for example, which, as we all know, has already spent all of its resources? What advice do you have for the Irish Government when it comes to combating youth unemployment? It is self-evident that we need to make major efforts in employment policy in order to reduce youth unemployment. That much is clear, but we also need real money to be able to do so. We also need to get behind it. Furthermore, there are, of course, other things that we need, such as more sensible protection against dismissal, or truly decent work. Finally, I would just like to reiterate what it is that we do not need, namely macro-economic conditionality over the forthcoming subsidy period. That is something that we should not even look into. We are observing at this point in time what that means. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent sanctions by the EU are not confidence-building measures, but sabre rattling. That is a fact. Attempting to get Iran to compromise by exerting more pressure is politically naive and also irresponsible. As the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, we do not want any nuclear programmes, that is clear, including in Iran. We strongly condemn the Iranian regime on account of its horrendous human rights violations, oppression of religious minorities and persecution of human rights activists, but stopping Iranian oil as a result of the de facto trade ban with Iran’s Central Bank will ultimately hit ordinary citizens. That is a fact. It will also help the Iranian regime’s election campaign ahead of the elections in March this year and will increase the risk of war throughout the region. That, Baroness Ashton, is the scale of what we are talking about here. There is as yet no genuine proof that Iran has a current nuclear weapons programme. There are indications up to 2003, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has provided no evidence for the period thereafter in its report. It has assumptions and the claims of the secret services. Instead of an escalation, we need a human rights dialogue and serious negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Middle East and peaceful coexistence throughout the region. That is what the EU should be doing instead of making the current situation worse. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, I would like to make the following point. We are not talking about the economic situation in Hungary. We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries. It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants. Instead, I would like to see Article 7 applied, because this situation involves a clear risk of a serious breach of the fundamental values of the EU. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the combined work and residence permit for third-country nationals in the EU came in like a lion and is going out like a lamb, to coin a phrase. This in no way opens the way for a truly simplified regulation for third-country nationals who would like to work in the EU. That remains the case even if residence is increasingly being linked with work. In many cases that may be all well and good – but it is the only focus here, and we see that as a problem. Furthermore, we do not feel that this directive is a step in the right direction. Firstly, this is because its scope is too narrow. Its provisions are narrow-minded and provincial. It is not just that it is only to be applicable to the executing Member State and not to the EU as a whole; that does not even get mentioned any more. It is also that the regulation is not to apply to family members of Union citizens if they are third-country nationals, nor to seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees or people under international or temporary protection. This gives rise to all kinds of individual directives, and as a result there are different classes of third-country nationals with differing rights. My second point is that there is no real simplification or legal harmonisation, and this is true through the mere fact that the Member States actually have the final say on all matters – such as whether it is the employer or the employee who is to apply for the permit. If it is the employer, the potential employee may not even get to see the application, such as in cases where it is rejected. He will have absolutely no opportunity to comment legally in any form whatsoever. We are also critical of the fact that an application may be deemed inadmissible if the Member State sets quotas for the labour market. The third point I would like to make – and I will concede this to the rapporteur – is that it is good that pension entitlements will be recognised. It is absolutely unacceptable, however, that there is not completely equal treatment with employees who are EU nationals. There are to be considerable restrictions – and these will depend on the class of person – when it comes to vocational training, social benefits – such as for family members – and access to public housing. That is really not acceptable. If that is made a fundamental principle, then it is a mistake and we cannot support it. That is why we are rejecting this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, a few hours ago, an important prize was awarded here in this Chamber. It was said that freedom, justice and solidarity are pillars of the European Union. However, I would like to ask you: how can that be reconciled with the fact that racist violence against the Roma is to a certain degree the order of the day in very many Member States and is a constant state of affairs in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and the Balkans? It is also the case that Roma, who are EU citizens, are being expelled not only from France, but also from Denmark, Italy, Germany and Finland. However, freedom, solidarity and justice, of which we speak so often here, should apply universally or not at all. It is scandalous – I cannot put it any better – if, despite an EU framework strategy, despite numerous promises by the Member States, the largest minority in Europe continues to be discriminated against. In the Czech Republic, I spoke with Roma families that were utterly shocked and, above all, frightened because anti-Roma demonstrations had been taking place for months right outside their front door – and with banners containing the words: ‘gas the Roma’! That is shocking, not just as a neighbour of these Roma, but it also not worthy of our history when we simply tolerate such a thing or attempt to change it with the use a few more police officers. In the Czech Republic, as in many other countries, Roma children still attend separate schools – and in the Czech Republic, for example, they go to schools with disabled children. As a left-leaning politician, I say to you that the Roma do not belong in separate schools, and neither do disabled children. That violates human rights and I believe that that needs to be said in this regard. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that separate schools for Roma are illegal. Despite this, these schools merrily continue. As we all know, the European Roma Rights Centre has examined 44 cases in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and found that violent attacks on Roma were utterly inadequately prosecuted and that no convictions were brought at all. Many law enforcement agencies are totally blind when it comes to the Roma. Moreover, the Czech Senate unabashedly confirmed recently that it will not participate in a Roma strategy. That is apartheid in action at the heart of Europe. We have to do something about this. There will also be a price to pay for the fact that the Roma framework strategy does not lay down any binding requirements and that the subject of anti-racism does not form part of this strategy. I can say to you quite honestly that enough is enough.; I would ask the Commission how long it intends to continue to sit back and watch. Where is the consistency in its actions when it comes, for example, to framework decisions for combating racism and the Anti-discrimination Directive being implemented – properly implemented – in the Member States? Article 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for the possibility of action being taken against Member States that have seriously breached the values of the EU. I therefore call on you most urgently to make use of this provision. After all, we must defend the rights and freedoms of the Roma as European citizens. Who will do that if we do not?

Mr President, I have a question for Mr Hahn concerning the delegated acts. These acts play an important role in cohesion policy and it is also clear to me that delegated acts are necessary for the implementation of a number of issues. Parliament and the Council also have a withdrawal option, which is a good thing. However, I believe that the situation has got rather out of hand and that these acts are being used in the case of questions which we in Parliament should be deciding on together with the Council. One example is the common strategic framework, Articles 10 and 11 of the general regulation, which lays down goals for subsidies from the Cohesion Fund, important challenges in the territorial area and actions to be taken centrally. My question is: why have you chosen the delegated act in the case of such an important document, for example, and not the ordinary legislative procedure? In this context, perhaps you can make some general remarks about the problems of delegated acts. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Hahn, you have already made some remarks on macro-economic conditionality. You have said that it will probably not be used at all, or at least only in an emergency or a similar situation. However, I would like to ask you nevertheless: is there a built-in safeguard and is it possible to prevent particularly disadvantaged regions, which would not receive money if a conditionality of this kind were to take effect, being put at a further disadvantage?

 Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a broader scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is taking a clear stance against this agreement, and will vote accordingly, in the clear knowledge that there are some aspects of the agreement that might seem acceptable according to the principle of ‘a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Of course we have understood this, thanks to Ms in ’t Veld. The counter-arguments are more convincing, however. We still have no proof of the need to record PNR data. The mass of data, or so-called waste data, actually makes it harder to find potential criminals. Despite everything, what we have here is a willy-nilly approach to data retention, even when no suspicion exists, and this, as my colleague has pointed out, is prohibited, not just in Germany but in several other Member States too. We wish to register genuinely serious concerns that this agreement cannot be reconciled with EU law. That is why we requested a corresponding legal opinion, which we are also presenting for the purposes of the discussion and vote. Even though it is, of course, better to a certain extent to have some sort of retention period rather than none at all, I would ask you seriously why it is necessary to store data for five-and-a-half years. This makes profiling realistic and feasible, particularly since it is not completely and definitively excluded by this agreement. A word about the scope of the agreement: the Commissioner referred to the fact that serious cross-border crime does not exist as a criminal offence in Australia. It simply does not exist. Instead of a minimum mandatory sentence of four years, we would have been better served with a list of specific criminal offences. Otherwise, our main concern is that this agreement will be used as the template for negotiations with the US, but not because the agreement is so bad, but rather because at least in Australia the data is processed by the customs authorities when it arrives there, while in the US, the responsible authority is the unknown quantity that is the Department of Homeland Security. This agreement turns innocent people into objects of suspicion on a wholesale basis and undermines elementary freedoms. My group wants nothing to do with this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, body scanners are placebos. If you look it up in Wikipedia, a placebo is a sham medicine that contains no active ingredient and thus has no pharmacological effect. The fact is that a ten-month test phase in Germany, for example, showed that body scanners resulted in a lower level of security than conventional methods and were therefore a failure. Sweat stains were signalled as a security risk, tissues as a danger. There were false alarm levels of up to 100%. No body scanner in the world can analyse body orifices or inside the body. Objects hidden there cannot be detected. We should not suppose that terrorists are more stupid than they are. Where body scanners were used regularly, it was not the success rate that went up, but rather the abuse rate. Take a look at the US: a woman there had to remove her breast prosthesis to prove what it was, and that was after scanning. In the UK, two women refused to be scanned for religious or health reasons and were not permitted to fly. The most embarrassing body checks exist as alternatives in various countries. The risk of abuse is likely to rise further in the future simply because the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided, as stated previously, that real body images are possible. That means being able to see the actual outlines. There have already been cases of offensive remarks having increased and that is a human rights problem. The word placebo comes from the Latin and means ‘I will please’. The only ones this will please are the market leaders in body scanners that make and sell this rubbish. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, Mr Tavares, do you know of any examples that would actually justify the expense of spending many millions – billions in fact – on developing these body scanners? Are there examples showing that they have resulted in an increase in security? Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there can scarcely be another institution established by the European Union that is so controversial when it comes to human rights as Frontex is. This agency is associated with shameful images on the high seas where thousands of people have lost their lives, of land borders where people are kept in custody and where deep trenches are now being dug. At heart, Frontex embodies an erring policy towards refugees in Europe, refugees who leave their homelands not only as a result of political persecution, but also for economic reasons – simply to survive – as a result of hunger, civil wars and climate disasters. The new Frontex mandate does incorporate real and substantial improvements – and for that I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil – such as the obligation to respect human dignity, the right of non-refoulement, non-discrimination, the prohibition of torture, the respect of refugee minors, and the guaranteeing of data protection. Rescues at sea are now finally to be given stability and there is to be a code of conduct for border officials – but it is also true that the mandate does not lay down a principle of refraining from the use of violence. Furthermore, who is to be responsible for actually checking up on proportionality and appropriateness? Frontex is having its competence clearly expanded as the lead body in border patrols and as the body that produces risk analyses, on the basis of which interventions and the return to their homelands of thousands and thousands more migrants will take place. Heaven knows how hard Parliament struggled to obtain improvements, but they will make no difference to the fact that a wolf is still a wolf, even if it is dressed in sheep’s clothing. Frontex is not necessary either as a border agency – the national defence institutions serve that purpose – or to repel migration, as migration is not, in fact, repelled, but merely territorially displaced. Frontex is absolutely not suitable to act as custodian of human rights, given that, ultimately, it categorises people as legal or illegal. People cannot be illegal! I do not understand how that is not accepted. In place of Frontex, what we need is a humanisation of the refugee situation, in Africa, for example, where almost a million refugees live in degrading conditions. That does not interest us, or only does so to a limited extent. We would rather take care of ourselves. We need an asylum system that demonstrates solidarity, at European level too, of course, and we definitely need a new neighbourhood policy on an equal footing. That, too, still lies ahead. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what kind of anachronism is this when, 22 years after the historic fall of the Berlin Wall, an EU Member State like Denmark re-introduces border controls? This is a dire warning for the entire European Union. We all know that the Schengen agreement does indeed allow for temporary border controls to be introduced in special circumstances, as we saw with the football World Cup in Germany in 2006. The Schengen system does not need any additional mechanism. If the Danish Government re-introduces permanent controls at its borders with Germany and Sweden, that constitutes an infringement of the agreement. I expect nothing less from the Commission than to treat this as what it is – an infringement of the agreement. This genie must be re-bottled, as freedom and freedom of movement are not up for negotiation; they are fundamental values that shape the European Union. They cannot be sacrificed to national vanities and the extreme Right. We do not need to change the Schengen agreement. We need more humanitarian asylum and migration laws. We do not need additional customs officials on the German-Danish border – what we need are steps to protect refugees and people fleeing from civil war. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already adopted a number of resolutions on the subject of passenger name records (PNR), which include specific requirements. In all cases these have been concerned with necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and the prohibition of profiling. We consider the legal basis of the agreement with Australia to be inappropriate. The agreement with Australia is aimed at harmonising the transfer of data prescribed under Australian law with European law, and particularly the law on data protection. An absolute requirement, therefore, is that reference must be made to Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Moreover, we would question once again its proportionality. If you bear in mind that, according to the Australian Government, in 2009 just five people were traced and accused of terrorist offences – and it was not even clear whether this was achieved as a result of PNR data – then it does not seem particularly proportionate for millions of records nonetheless to be retained for years on end. As we all know, when it comes down to it they are being used for profiling purposes – and we do not even have a uniform agreed definition of profiling yet. I do not know how often the Commission has already been asked for such reasons to prove that the transfer of PNR data is necessary, or to present and look into alternatives. A really substantive report is necessary if this is to be investigated. One more comment on purpose limitation: how can we ensure that the data is used only for the intended purpose if various third countries conclude agreements with each other under which PNR data is systematically exchanged? This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to ensure this. Moreover, we are awaiting a very clear answer from the Commission on the relationship between PNR and the US Secure Flight programme. As everyone is aware, the purpose of the Secure Flight programme is to exclude so-called potentially dangerous passengers from flights. There have been frequent cases of mistakes being made and passengers being misidentified, as a result of which the persons concerned have been prevented from travelling and have practically no legal means by which to defend themselves. One final word: please do not forget that we are talking not just about self-determination – about self-determination in the sphere of information – but also, and above all, about freedom of movement as a basic right, as laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the intermediate category, I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning, Mr Pieper, for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 2013. However, it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions, in particular those hit by the crisis. We are currently talking about 51 regions. When confronted with so many regions that have been affected, it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category. This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves. In other respects, Mr Pieper’s report contains a great deal of light and shade. Among other things, we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty. We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation. It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Bulgaria and Romania were included in the full application of the Schengen acquis. Think about it – the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union. For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States – including my home country of Germany – totally incomprehensible. The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered. Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments. A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here. For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen. Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council’s impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents. Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one. We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September. To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati. She stated, ‘The Romanians are euphoric citizens. They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve. To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics’. That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to get to the point here. We do not need a new rule on the temporary or any other reintroduction of border controls, either now or in the future. We need to grasp that freedom of movement – and that is, after all, the message of the European Union – is something that you cannot simply displace or circumvent at will. It is a citizens’ right that you cannot simply relativise. Do you want to know what honestly annoys me? We hear a lot said about solidarity. Who is talking about solidarity with the countries of Africa who are currently having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees and will continue to do so – without great debate? Is anyone talking about solidarity with the people who are fleeing war and coming here to Europe? We need to show these people a bit of respect. To be frank, I do not want to discuss any changes to Schengen or any rules whatsoever; I simply want us to deal sensibly with migration once and for all. We will not achieve this by using Frontex as a means of deporting people; we will achieve it by having a democratic and humanitarian asylum law. That is what we should be talking about in Europe and it must apply throughout Europe. That is what we should fight for. That is our real task. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are now to have a general strategy for the Roma, but I am afraid that that not everything in the garden is rosy. That is because the overall proposals that the Commission has placed on the table are far behind the many years of discussions with representatives of the Roma, some of which were held in this House. For years, representatives of the Roma community, both with and without a framework strategy, have been pointing out the need for targeted measures and clear, specific requirements. We do not even have clear sanctions should this strategy not be adhered to. Although there have been some proposals in this direction, no actual sanctions exist, so that the system is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese. The strategy on the Roma must take account of all the significant areas. This is what was agreed. However, what does the Commission have to offer other than the four key points? There is no provision in the structures for the participation and inclusion of the Roma communities in all the decisions that relate to them. There are no structures for the specific implementation of targets. There is no gender perspective. Something that also really irritates me and that I believe to be a scandal is the fact that you are unwilling to undertake any explicit action to combat discrimination against the Roma community. You complain that the EU structural funds for the Roma are not used. I would like to ask you quite openly: Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date? I think so. We, as members of the GUE/NGL Group, are highly critical of this communication. We do not believe it to be adequate and I expect the appropriate amendments to be made. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to address three points. Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so. I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany – above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest. Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration – that is how I would describe them – are null and void. Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmström mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy’s idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million. Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled. Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing. Frontex and Dublin II – we need a rethink where these are concerned. We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to get right to the heart of the matter, this is all about introducing a uniform, mandatory EU strategy, instead of the 27 individual, differing strategies in the Member States. Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens. What is it all about? It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone. It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe. It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services. We are not doing these people a favour. We are granting them their legal rights. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti. We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding. There is, though, one thing I would like to add. None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe. We must see this as one of Europe’s central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination. We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole. We must speak with one voice. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children’s home. He wrote: ‘I have found my parents again. We are being transported to the concentration camp. After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death. Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me. Greetings to you all. See you in heaven. Robert.’ Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold. The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over. We need the whole truth about this chapter of history. The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again. We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people. We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions. Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction. The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States. The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this. A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important. It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular. However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive. Therefore, in a year’s time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs. They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made. It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status. It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part. It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking. We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging – which I openly admit – and also in many respects with illegal migration. It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and – what to me is the most important point – that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors. I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive. Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability. Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction. If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated. I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports. Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will simply ask the question: what is the situation with regard to anti-discrimination and the equal treatment of Roma in Europe? When we now hear that ethnically motivated databases on the Roma – and I believe these databases as such are prohibited – are being set up by the French Gendarmerie, but also by other countries, and, to a certain extent, for preventative purposes, then that really is the limit. Both in France and in the EU, databases that are primarily used to compile personal data on the racial or ethnic origin of people are quite simply prohibited due to the high risk of them being misused and on account of the risk of discrimination. Only under very particular – purpose-specific – circumstances, which take non-discrimination into consideration, can the collection of data of this nature be carried out at all. The Roma must not be criminalised, and that is the crucial point. Ethnically motivated databases for the purpose of preventing crimes are unlawful. The Roma must not be the subject of the special collection of data on account of their way of life, and we expect the Commission, in other words you, Mrs Reding, to repudiate any form of ethnic or racist data collection and to work hard to ensure that this is indeed stopped in the relevant countries. Frankly, I ask myself more and more what it is other than talk, talk, talk that actually happens in this Parliament and in the framework of the EU, and what, in practical terms, we have actually managed to do to improve the situation of the Roma in Europe other than talk, talk, talk. If we look at the collection of data, we see that the Roma have become scapegoats and people to push around in many Member States of the EU. They are being deported to Kosovo and, in doing this, France has been contravening EU treaties for months, the principle of anti-discrimination is being violated – and the Commission behaves as if it is satisfied – and I see this rather differently to the previous speaker – with the promise by the French Government to provide the legal basis for transposing the directive on freedom of movement by the beginning of 2011. In the interests of decency, however, it must be said that France has to put a stop to the deportations of Roma, and it is also important for those Roma who have been unjustly deported to have their return to France facilitated. In connection with the databases, I would like to ask you: what definite information to you have, what initiatives will you take, if these databases actually exist in this way, and will you initiate treaty infringement proceedings in such cases? Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should ask ourselves what we are actually trying to achieve with this whole debate. Are we trying to bring about a small improvement in equality and a little assistance for families as cheaply as possible? Of course, making family life compatible with work costs money. I would simply like to ask my fellow Members from Germany: what is expenditure of EUR 1 billion in Germany if, at the same time, we are handing out EUR 450 billion in bank guarantees? What do we actually want in this area? Full pay for parental leave is quite correct. What else should it be? It is not time off, it is not holiday; this is work that people are doing. Of course we want the period extended to 20 weeks, because we believe that this is the only way this work can be accommodated. Moreover, we do not merely want to bring about a bit more equality in working life. We want complete equality, for women and men. We need to take drastic steps if we are to achieve this, such as a statutory minimum wage in all Member States. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my thanks to Mrs Fajon for her excellent report, which has really moved us forward on this issue. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is very clear in its support for visa liberalisation throughout the Western Balkans, and in this case we are, of course, also in favour of the removal of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, specifically so that the opening up of these countries actually gets under way and because it will provide better opportunities for their overall development. We hope that such opportunities will really be exploited. Personally, I would also like to see this kind of arrangement in place for Kosovo very soon – or at least for initial talks to take place. There is an urgent need for this, as Kosovo is otherwise a small island in the Western Balkans that is actually cut off. What worries me, however – and I want to make this point – is that we are compelling the introduction, at the same time, of biometric data. I want to be very clear on this: the use of biometric data is as controversial as ever and, above all, the use of such data is not secure. I say this on the back of news in Germany a few days ago that the PIN codes can be, and have been, cracked. There needs to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen. Let us do everything we can to ensure not only that these countries have their visa requirement lifted, but that social and economic development is set in train there. There is an urgent need for this in both countries, and the people have earned it. We in the EU should also work towards this goal. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called voluntary exodus of the Roma from France is a clear case of expulsion – and indeed of the largest and oldest population group that constitutes a minority in Europe. This will encourage those on the political right, the extreme right. We must reject this – including here in the European Parliament. This is vital. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left therefore demands an end to these deportations. Mrs Reding, I would have liked you, too, to call for us first to demand an end to these deportations and then everything else that follows on from that. President Sarkozy’s government is contravening EU law, because it is carrying out the wholesale deportation of Roma, who originate from EU Member States, without consideration of individual cases, because it is invalidating the principle of free movement, it is violating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is violating the Charter with regard to equal treatment. I say to you in all sincerity that it is finally time for action. We have already discussed this problem numerous times. We now need to take real measures that will bring about a change. The Roma are at home in Europe. They are part of the European Community and should also remain so. We must make sure of it. We are therefore also critical of the deportation of Roma from Germany, Austria, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and other countries in the Western Balkans. We need an integrated European strategy, and one for all Roma, not only some of them. We must fight for this. My final point is that the European idea of solidarity and self-determination must be evident in our dealings with the Roma minority, otherwise it does not exist. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate must focus on two aspects. One aspect, namely that of data protection, has now been very frequently addressed. It is quite true that some things have been improved, but the simple fact is that the transfer of bulk data has not been eliminated. What really annoys me the most is that, where data protection is concerned, Europol has, in fact, been given an extension of its powers: on what legal basis, we ask? However, I also wish to say quite clearly that there is also another aspect, about which we must talk very seriously, namely that even if all the data protection problems were to be solved, every last one, the question would remain whether the principle according to which the bank data of millions of people in Europe is transferred for prevention purposes actually makes a real contribution to the fight against terror. I doubt it profoundly, and there has been no evaluation and nothing to support it. Instead, a de facto
 surveillance of citizens will be introduced, and I wish to remind you that even the Data Protection Officer does not see the necessity of such a regulation. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, let me say that I believe – and I am referring to the Schengen Information System here – that the EU should not be operating a wish-based policy, but a policy based on the reality. When it comes to the Schengen Information System, that means that we must take account of the fact that the tests – what have been called the ‘first milestone’ – have failed. After eight years of tinkering, we know that the aim of the measure proposed by the Commission – the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II – is unachievable by the Member States, both on technical and legal grounds. That is not my evaluation – it is the evaluation of the Federal Republic of Germany. That is the position back in my home country, and it is a position, by the way, that I fully share. EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme, and the Commission would like to spend more. We do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013; we want to make that very plain. Instead, we want to abandon this system and start the search for an alternative. Secondly, the German Left Party is fundamentally critical of SIS II – I want to point that out, too, at this juncture – as access to the system is being dramatically extended, for example, to the secret services. In Germany, there is a requirement that the secret services and the police are separated. Thus, any mixing of the secret services’ and the police’s data will mean that the whole system will be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court. That is something that I needed to mention, at least from the German point of view. We also oppose SIS II because it involves the collection of vast quantities of data and the gathering and recording of biometric data. That is neither purposive nor proportionate.

Madam President, freedom over the clouds, as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang, will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data. In August, a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having. Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists, the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space. As we all know in this House, this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding. Today, US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data – credit card numbers, booking data, seating preferences, special food preferences, IP addresses and passenger information – without clear data protection regulations. I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that, as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying, referred to as PNR, as it now is to be developed. We cannot support it as it is currently formulated, because it is not for a specific purpose, and it is not proportionate or useful. Finally, I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour. We need disclosure regulations like the USA’s privacy act. These must be opened to European citizens. The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague who is unable to be here and I would like to make a few remarks. The first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the Structural Funds. There are certainly some things which we would criticise and Mrs Schroedter has mentioned these, but I believe that we should not hold back for this reason alone. We welcome the simplification and are also of the opinion that the regulation must be implemented urgently. Too much time has already been wasted. However, I must speak openly. The compromise is not exactly how we had envisaged it. As everyone is aware, the Commission submitted another proposal relating to the one-off 100% payment of interim payment claims for a limited period and for the purpose of labour market policy measures. This was not accepted for a variety of reasons which were discussed in detail in the Committee on Regional Development. However, we must ask ourselves whether we have done enough to put in place what the Commission referred to in its communication of 3 June 2009 as a common commitment to employment which can be used to counteract the crisis. The objective was to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to help overcome the crisis and this is what we are discussing now. The European Structural Funds in particular are, as everyone knows, one of the main tools for investing in citizens and for combating the crisis and creating jobs. If we take a look at Europe, it becomes clear that the crisis has had a huge impact on the labour markets in the Member States and that action really is needed. There have been massive increases in unemployment, not only in the five countries, but in all the Member States, if we look at the situation in detail. In addition, unemployment also plays a major role independently of the crisis. In Europe, we have a very high level of unemployment which is still rising and is unrelated to the crisis. The alternative proposal submitted by the Commission certainly represents a step forward, which we welcome, because at least five Member States with a GDP that has fallen by 10% since 2008 will receive a relatively large subsidy. These Member States will benefit from this and from additional advance payments from the Cohesion and European Structural Funds. All of this is good, but we would like to see more being done. You know what our position is from what we have said in the committee. On the one hand, we are happy and, on the other hand, not so happy, but every step forward takes us forward too and this is where we should be going.

 Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, I think we believed that we had only a limited chance and therefore decided against it. I assume that my colleague thought the same thing. When I looked at the Commission’s overall initiative, I was thrilled. However, after long discussions on these subjects in the last few days, I have learnt a few things. I would have liked to see more. It is true that we could have submitted an amendment, you are right. However, if we are honest with one another, we know what will happen and this is why my group decided against an amendment. I must take note of that myself. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, thank you very much. We have two amendments, one of which is an amendment to the amendment. I would like to introduce both of them. We would like the words ‘the Council and’ to be deleted. The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be:  ‘calls on the Member States to refrain from forced repatriations of minorities if they face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment once they have been forcibly returned’. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, in December 2009, when I was in Pristina and Mitrovica and saw how people are living in the Mahala and, in particular, in the lead-contaminated camps, I was rather shocked, particularly about the plight of the children. In almost every conversation I had, I was told that, not only in Kosovo, but also in many countries in Europe, the situation is dire for one of the oldest population groups in Europe, namely the Roma. I met Bekim Syla from the Roma and Ashkali Documentation Centre in Pristina, who received us with the words ‘We are tired of talking’. Action needs to be taken, and therefore our absolute highest expectation of the Córdoba Summit is that there will be more than mere talk and that action will be taken immediately. Immediate action means not resting on our laurels behind the EU directives implementing the principle of equal treatment, of equal treatment of persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, and also the Employment Framework Directive, because it will not do any good. Immediate action requires the recognition and assumption that these directives are not sufficient to protect the Roma in the European Union from degrading and discriminatory treatment and – most importantly – to enable their permanent integration. What we need, therefore, is a European Roma strategy that is a component of all policy areas – an integral component of all policies. However, the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures. What we need are medium and long-term political initiatives. We urgently need measures for the economic development of the Roma communities. The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible; it must do so now, so that the Roma can also benefit from it. This includes micro-credit loans, which need to be issued with as little bureaucracy as possible, for example, for the reconstruction of Roma settlements. It includes very specific measures for the promotion of health and for education, training and the development of the labour market. I would like to make it quite clear that no child should fail because of educational or language barriers. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left does not want Roma schools, but schools for everyone, where the Roma can also live and learn. I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism. Antiziganism must not be regarded as or remain a trivial offence, but must be punished as a crime. The EU bears a lot of the responsibility for the extent to which, it is to be hoped, we will soon succeed in bringing about justice for the more than 10 million Roma in Europe, because it starts with justice and should continue with equality. For this, we need a very clear political ‘yes’ and a resolute, powerful European framework strategy, and – quite frankly – it also needs our passionate commitment, as MEPs and as people, to this population group – the Roma and Sinti. Let us take action now. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is absolutely indisputable that body scanners quite clearly represent an invasion of privacy and a serious invasion at that. We need to ask ourselves two questions. The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism. We do not currently have any clear answers to this question. This is why I support what Mrs Malmström has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners. I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else. The second question concerns the risks to health. Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week. I would have to do so at least twice a week. This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health. No real assessments have been carried out in this area. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made. Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, human trafficking is, in reality, a scourge of the present day, and it feeds on poverty and ignorance. Its worst form is the trafficking of children, which is often linked to sexual abuse. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left believe that there is an urgent need for action on the Commission’s part. One of the most important prerequisites for successfully combating human trafficking is strengthening the rights of the victims. Only if this succeeds – and not only through punitive measures – can human trafficking be combated at all. That requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims. One of the things these victims need is effective protection and support before, during and also after criminal proceedings in which they testify as witnesses. This must be a high priority for the period of reconsideration, specifically, as well as where witness testimonies are retracted. Long-term witness protection programmes are urgently needed. Another thing that I think is important is that all victims of human trafficking, not just children, must be given free counselling. When dealing with children it is also necessary – coming back to this point – for it to be made possible to make use of child-specialist lawyers. There is a need for urgent measures to strengthen prevention, such as training for lawyers, the police, judges and counsellors. I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency intends to address this issue. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission’s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased. In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions. Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed. The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan. Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy. We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy. Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education. The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here. This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters. However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances. Time is running out! Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be giving the resolution its backing. The Stockholm Programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day. Its main error is that a Europe of rights is being created to which EU citizens will be granted access but others who live in Europe will not. These other people will not be entitled to the same human and civil rights. The EU wants to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights – something that we welcome – yet, at the same time, migrants are to be separated out according to the ‘legal or illegal’ principle. Frontex is therefore being tooled up to wage war on so-called illegal migration, completely obscuring the idea of an unprejudiced immigration policy from view. This is where Stockholm fails. Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security. It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being. Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU’s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis. This will mean the shredding of people’s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality. Allow me, as an MEP from eastern Germany, to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vehemently reject the measures being taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to deport Roma and other minorities to Kosovo. Soon, around 2 500 people are to be deported per year. These measures particularly affect 10 000 Roma, but also Egyptians and Ashkali. Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence. People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France. I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable. The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation. Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica. Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered. A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case … (The President cut off the speaker) Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 I generally believe that exemptions from and relaxation of visa rules are positive moves for the coexistence of peoples and for improving cooperation between countries. For the Western Balkans, in particular, it is important that all the countries of the region should be granted such a prospect. I therefore very much welcome the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are to be included in these regulations. Visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the Western Balkans, however. That would be the case if only Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats were able to enjoy exemption from the visa requirement while Bosnian Muslims were not. I also argue in favour of medium-term solutions for Kosovo. In so doing, I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law. That does not relieve us of the obligation to consider how this state and its citizens are to be dealt with in future, however. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, first I should like to say that we do not share the concerns of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is perfectly simple: we believe that further development towards SIS II is not necessary and is politically wrong. We take this view for three reasons: firstly, because it mixes secret service and police data, giving rise to a data system that no longer guarantees controllability and in which personal data is not, in fact, protected. The second is biometric data, which is being anchored here as a large-scale experiment and, thirdly, SIS II is, of course, to be used against so-called illegal immigration. Hence our proposal: as we all know, we have SIS I. We consider it reasonable to develop this further ‘as one for all’
. It is a pragmatic approach, even if we are strongly criticised for it. However, we believe that, with the approach being pursued here, nothing more can be done. To put it simply: SIS II is a de facto
 failure and to keep on crawling round it – to put it one way – is meaningless. What is important is that money which is being put to the wrong use here should be saved, which will mean we have fewer problems with the whole thing and can stop worrying about the delay with SIS II. I say this also from the point of view of Saxony, a region of Germany close to Poland and the Czech Republic. I know full well here that it would certainly make more sense to do something towards stabilisation within the police than to introduce something like this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a new MEP, let me start by saying that human rights issues are also extremely important to my party, the German Left, and that we condemn any violation of human rights – irrespective of where or by whom they are committed. That has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs. I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that, time and again, human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered. Natalia Estemirova, Stanislav Markelov, Zarema Sadulayeva, these are examples of murders that are truly shocking. It is therefore important that we in this House concern ourselves with this issue. I am concerned that cases like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya are not investigated. If this process is now re-opened, I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested, because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind. What we expect is simply for an immediate and full investigation to be carried out into these murders and for this matter to be dealt with ruthlessly, for Russia not to wait any longer but to take up the fight to protect human rights itself. It must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death. I also believe that the forthcoming EU-Russia summit needs to tackle these issues as a matter of urgency, and not merely as side issues, but with the prominence that they deserve. Personally, I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this House. I would have preferred not to debate issues such as these on Thursday afternoon and I believe this topic should also concern us even if it was about enterprise and trade. Such issues are often given secondary priority. That is what we want to change and that is also something I wanted to say here. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in the light of yesterday’s debate and with a clear look towards Ukraine, I would suggest that we clearly state that it is the right of the Ukrainian people to decide on their future without any international intervention. Therefore, I suggest replacing Amendment 1 with the following wording: ‘underlines the fact that it is for the Ukrainian people – and only for them – to decide, free from foreign interference, on the geopolitical orientation of the country and on which international agreements and communities Ukraine should join’. I suggest that the sentence should be added as a new last sentence to paragraph 19. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

I fully understand that, but that means that we have to intend in our policy nevertheless to try to find ways to build bridges with the Russian Federation and to show that our policy towards the Eastern Neighbourhood countries is not aimed or directed against the Russian Federation but must help overcome this strategic game and play then in the interests of the people and the citizens in all the countries affected.

Mr President, Mr Commissioner, thank you. I want to thank all participating colleagues, in particular the rapporteurs and the team involved in negotiating the result. I also want specially to thank the NGOs and civil society which have ensured that pressure from outside Parliament encouraged us to take up the responsibility in this directive, in particular the NGO Publish What You Pay, because of their struggle for the items included in our directive. But they have achieved only the first step. Ecological and employment criteria form part of the responsibility we have to take into account. We also want to recognise that the requirement of country-by-country reporting of taxes and other financial data by companies in all sectors has to be included, and I guess that the discussion is just now under way among Member States and the Commission about extending  financial transparency to all sectors, as I have already said earlier, especially to tackle the widespread tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance that costs governments billions of euros each year and which belongs to the theme we have been discussing here.

Mr President, even though it is late, this is a matter on which we are doubtless all agreed: investments are important. The rule of law is a central prerequisite for the flow of investments. Ensuring compliance with the law, however, is a task for the courts.  Commissioner, you want to ensure, in binding national agreements between the EU and third countries, the right for investors to take action against governments, leaving judgment to trade specialists to whom environmental or other social interests do not matter. With this law you deprive the governments of the Member States of the right to defend their own political majority decisions, such as the withdrawal from nuclear energy. You even want to be able to force them to relinquish their position and take over the position of the Commission. What is the point then in having elections?  Internationally the number of such lawsuits has increased more than tenfold to nearly 500 at this moment in time. It is a mighty billion-dollar arbitration industry in its own right. On average we are talking about USD 8 million in legal costs and over USD 100 million in compensation claims per case. This law creates the foundations for the plundering of the European Union and its Member States by specialised law firms and corporations. From which budget line do you want to pay for lost lawsuits? That is not clear, and we have to discuss the whole issue at length. I also want to thank the rapporteur; while we were discussing the report, we established that this question is still open and on the table. I would also like to expand on the third question we raised. Companies in the European Union have to go via the ordinary courts, but you wish to enable investors from the outside to make use of the State method, which provides for far greater sums and compensation for damages. Do you intend to encourage companies to establish a branch abroad and then sue the EU or its Member States as an external plaintiff? A recent study concludes that in the text foreseen on the agreement with Canada, the CETA agreement, the wording on the table enables exactly this procedure, and legal action could soon be started against us, for example regarding the legislation prohibiting or regulating fracking.  I therefore cannot agree to the proposed bill and we will probably reject it, but I would like to receive certain answers to the questions we raised. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, I want to stress very clearly that the disappearance of Sombath Somphone is a most worrying example of the practice of arbitrary arrest by elements of the police. The world is watching this case very closely. I urge the Government of Laos to do its utmost to find and release Sombath Somphone. I call on High Representative Lady Ashton to make it absolutely clear that the outcome of this case will be a benchmark for the rule of law in Laos and that it will be crucial for the judgment on whether or not Laos qualifies for an enhancement in our relations, including trade relations. I welcome the fact that our colleagues from the ASEAN parliaments have already undertaken a fact-finding mission to Laos and I call on the ASEAN Human Rights Commission to set up immediately a committee to investigate the events surrounding the enforced disappearance of Sombath Somphone.  Finally, we will be watching closely in future because Laos has to understand that we will make the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as environmental and labour standards, a precondition for further relations between us and them.

Mr President, yesterday we had a very sensitive, emotional debate on the trade agreement on Colombia and Peru. It was a controversial issue for several political groups. My group will therefore ask Parliament to withhold its consent today and send the agreement back to the Committee on International Trade, for three main reasons which I have circulated to Members, and you can read in your mailboxes. Firstly, we have a study which explains that there is no provision to control and monitor financial flows in the agreement with Colombia and Peru, the two biggest coca exporters, whereas there are such provisions in other FTAs. On the one hand, the agreement seeks to close the window for tax evasion, tax fraud and money laundering, while on the other hand, it opens doors wide open to similar activities. The second reason is the human rights situation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and several trade unions have explained that the human rights situation is not such that we should consent to the conclusion of this agreement.  Thirdly, the trade unions, ETUC and other such organisations are asking us not to give our consent. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Jörg Leichtfried. In my view, he has succeeded in devising a way forward which all the groups can support. I know from experience that the negotiations that lie ahead will not be easy, especially as a number of Member States have what I can only describe as an allergic reaction to the issue of delegated acts. Despite the lip service paid in fine speeches to the importance of the European Parliament and how it should be granted more powers, these same government representatives are refusing to recognise Parliament’s equal role to the Council, as an legislator with equal rights, when it comes to amending the legislative procedure. As a legislator, however, we are prepared to delegate powers to the Commission in specific cases, subject to a limit in time, while retaining a right of veto.  The Council is no longer the only institution to sit at the table with the Commission. I therefore urge the Council to stop dragging its feet. Due to this issue, we have already lost far too much time on a number of important dossiers. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, we should give very careful consideration to the causes and the effect. We are in danger of taking a very short-sighted view of complex economic and social developments and, with populist actions, unleashing a trade war with China. That is the last thing the European Union needs at present! Yes, we need fair trade and fair production, but what has actually happened? As a result of cutbacks in the support schemes in Germany and other countries, the photovoltaic market was artificially constricted, resulting in increased competition. If this triggers a major dispute at the political level, we jeopardise the trade links of manufacturers of polysilicon, as well as putting exports in other sectors at risk. We also jeopardise the global supply of technologies that we urgently need for the transformation of our energy systems. Mr Jadot has already highlighted the challenges associated with renewable energies. Our discussions about the EU budget and the positions of the EU Member States on drastic budget cuts also have implications for the issue that is the subject of this debate. We cannot achieve a solution through confrontation. We can only do so through cooperation. I would therefore urge the Commission to make arrangements as soon as possible, as time is really pressing, for a joint forum for European, US and Chinese manufacturers and to support networking between developers, producers and distributors in these three key regions.

Madam President, Commissioner, 92.72727 % was the result celebrated by President Lukashenko’s associates in the most recent parliamentary elections. Otherwise, everything is following an all-too-familiar pattern: the election observers deliver their detailed verdict on the obviously-not-free-and-fair nature of the elections, we adopt our motion for a resolution and the Council imposes a few more sanctions or extends the existing ones. Beyond the Bug, the new parliament remains without an opposition and, therefore, exempt from criticism and correction, while those who want to see a different Belarus are still excluded, persecuted or locked up. The daily lives of Belarusians are still governed by the arbitrariness of politics and the greed of oligarchs.  In the description and assessment of this development, there is barely anything to choose between the political groups of this House. I also believe that nobody expected any other result or any changes to take place in Belarus. However, if that is true, then I must, at this point, reiterate the doubts I have already expressed on repeated occasions. Sanctions appear to be ineffective as a tool. They have not previously had any serious impact, either in Belarus or elsewhere.  Mr Füle has spoken again on the EU’s current activities as regards Belarus. We consider much of that to be worthwhile, such as the direct engagement with civil society under the European dialogue on modernisation. The problem with these activities, however, is that they fail to address Belarusians in their specific circumstances as consumers and workers. People want to discuss the job market, not industrial relations, co-determination rights or compliance with International Labour Organisation or environmental standards and so on. However, if these sessions are not used to tackle the issues of social justice faced on both sides of the Bug, then the foundations of the autocratic system undeniably still in place in Belarus will barely shake.  I would like to conclude with the following point: when we lived in a divided Europe, it was extremely important that, in spite of all the criticism levelled at those in power, a line of communication was kept open. Historically, we have shifted from sanctions to dialogue. It seems to me that, at present, we are moving in the opposite direction. In view of the obvious ineffectiveness of this policy, the question is: what do we do when we have exhausted all the options, when we have tightened the last thumbscrew? It is better to begin to confront the political leaders of Belarus with our arguments and demands in the context of political dialogue. That requires the EU Member States to cast aside their contradictory policy. The use of sanctions against repressive states does nothing to alter the repressive system of the State in question.

Madam President, Commissioner, as we discuss – not for the first time – the accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the Russian Federation, it is easy to forget that trade with the Russian Federation is, and in my opinion will continue to be, of strategic relevance to Europe because there is so much of it and because of the direction it is taking.  I would like to respond to the report by Mr Sturdy, since he examines the status of the relationship with the Russian Federation from economic perspectives, taking Russia’s accession to the WTO, after years of negotiation, as the reference point. I am grateful to the permanent rapporteur for trade negotiations with the Russian Federation for not allowing himself to ignore troubling news about social conflicts, increasingly arbitrary behaviour by the authorities and new, ambivalent legal situation in Russia, but for sticking soberly to the facts.  There are policy areas that cannot just be subsumed under the logic and dynamism of foreign policy. We have talked about this here several times before. Parliament should also form policy with a view to economic cooperation and create trade relations independently of political trends. I welcome the fact that the Commission representatives here in Parliament recently made a commitment to guarantee the stability of this relationship and, as a consequence, to take the Russian leadership at its word regarding the modernisation of the country and its interest in having the EU at its side as a partner. One of the major lessons of the earlier conflicts in Europe is that rapprochement brings change. Mutual rapprochement works in the 21st century but only on an equal footing and through joint efforts. Trade is not an instrument for this rapprochement but does have exactly this effect. This change, which, along with further economic cooperation, we feel is justified, should have as its aim a movement towards greater social justice, less poverty, greater democracy, obviously greater rule of law and thus respect for human rights. We know that the rule of law without democracy – or vice versa – does not work. However, greater democracy without greater social justice, greater application of trade union rights, international labour norms, environmental standards, etc. is even worse. This also applies to the serious consideration of the impacts of the Russian Federation’s accession to the WTO, which in the medium term are not easy to predict, on jobs in industry, the service sector and elsewhere.  I believe we should also take a fresh look at trade barriers. What is really preventing trade with Russia at present is not only trade barriers as we define them but also the continued existence of the visa requirement. The statements at the EU-Russia summit in this regard read well but have not added anything of substance yet. We ought to change this. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an intelligent agreement between the EU and Japan would lead to stronger integration of the two economies. It goes without saying that 128 million potential customers in high-wage Japan offer very attractive prospects for European companies and their workforces in a range of sectors. Mutual integration of know-how in production chains could improve the global competitiveness of thousands of supplier companies. As you hear, I am using the subjunctive, because both your report this evening, Commissioner De Gucht, and important paragraphs in the EP resolution now before us make no offer of partnership; rather, they make unilateral demands to Japan. In my view, that is not a good starting point for long-term cooperation that brings mutual benefits. What we are discussing this evening is the mandate for the negotiations. I am in favour of a clear, frank and open-ended discussion of the differences between the EU and Japan around the negotiating table. A real partnership cannot be based on either side dictating terms. That is why, as a Group, we have problems with the text of the resolution. Let us have a look at it. There are large chunks of the text that appear to have been written by the car industry. At a time when we are facing a climate crisis, how can we seriously demand a commitment from the Japanese Government to abolish the special treatment for electric and hybrid vehicles and the concessions for micro vehicles such as Kei-Cars
, just so that we can export more diesel-powered vehicles? The resolution’s over-emphasis on the abolition of non-tariff measures also conflicts with the findings of the Copenhagen study on trade between the EU and Japan. This study recognises that many of these measures help to improve general welfare, especially in the fields of health, the environment and consumer protection. We should therefore look at what the proposed arrangements are intended to achieve and seek an outcome which brings benefits to society but still promotes trade. Furthermore, companies surveyed have mentioned other reasons why they are deterred from investing in Japan. Above all, there is the language barrier, cultural differences, which also affect consumer preferences, high taxes and wage costs. Anyone who is reluctant to pay qualified translators, or to develop successful marketing strategies to promote their goods in Japan, or to pay local wages and taxes should invest at home instead. These types of trade barrier cannot and should not be removed by an agreement. In this context, the Committee on International Trade gained some very interesting insights last year into the strategy pursued by IKEA, a very large company that has tailored its operations to suit Japanese consumption patterns, culture and social standards. We need an agreement with non-tariff elements of cooperation. Joint programmes can bring together businesses and trade unions, consumer associations, academics, administrators and young people from Europe and Japan. Let us work towards a new culture of cooperation. That would also bring practical benefits for Europe’s SMEs in terms of energy efficiency and high-tech cooperation. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a proposal from you, Commissioner, that has the potential to do enormous damage to Europe’s reputation. While our partners are still engaged in negotiations with the Commission, you are looking to put a gun to their heads, forcing them to capitulate under the threat of exclusion from the European market. Your approach has completely discredited the European Union as a partner in negotiations. Ambassadors from all the relevant countries have vividly described to me what is at stake for them and their population. The Committee on Development, armed with excellent and reliable barometers of mood in the African partner states, has recognised this and has therefore completely rejected the Commission’s proposal in the statement from my colleague and group chair Gabi Zimmer. My group is strongly supportive of this position, even in view of the trade-related aspects. I would call on all Members of this House, including my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, to take this development policy perspective to heart and not to risk decades of close cooperation because of a short-sighted unilateral decision by the Commissioner for Trade. We will have a roll-call vote. Commissioner De Gucht, your regulation would be devastating for the East African community. You risk isolating Kenya from the other Member States or causing this association of states to wave goodbye to Europe as its most important partner. A number of trading nations around the world would be happy at this development. You have made an unjust accusation against the Africans. You are seeking to punish a delay for which you yourself are responsible. Why, for example, is the Commission insisting on abolishing export taxes? Namibia only levies such taxes on raw materials exports. If primary processing takes place in Namibia itself, no taxes are payable. I see this as smart and legitimate economic policy, pointing the way for an industrial policy that is completely in line with the objectives of EU development policy. Commissioner, you are taking a very short-sighted approach that runs counter to the medium- and long-term interests of Europe and the expansion of its trade relations. I would call on you to withdraw your proposal. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe have been discussing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) for months, as we also have here in this House. They came to the conclusion that they do not want or need ACTA. They are concerned that ACTA represents a threat to their freedom in the digital world. They are also worried about issues of central data protection. We have learnt during the course of this debate that the Internet has brought a new dimension to democracy and to our lives. It has become an important aspect of the way in which democracy in the European Union functions, particularly over recent weeks and months. The citizens are pinning all their hopes on the European Parliament and relying on it to defend their interests against the Commission, which has negotiated this agreement, Mr De Gucht, with a mandate from the Council over a period of six years. Two years ago, we insisted that more transparency was needed and we succeeded in bringing the secret ACTA negotiations into the light of day. Now we must not postpone this debate. We must come to a decision. We do not need to wait for the Court of Justice of the European Union, because this concerns the content of the agreement, as other Members have already said. We must decide now. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a quite different dimension. We must all work together to bring about change. We live in an age when the ways in which information and knowledge are used are becoming increasingly separated from the concept of private property. We need to develop new structures that will equate to a new legal culture concerning the access to and use of content. Children must acquire an understanding of this area in school. This is the content of the debate about ACTA and it also applies to the debate about the future development of patents, copyright, international trade and economic cooperation in a multilateral and networked world. We also need to discuss this on a multilateral basis with China, Brazil and many other countries within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and to come to an agreement about it. Mr De Gucht, I believe that you are not certain about or fully aware of the revolutionary impact of the Internet. In the case of ACTA, you are continuing to defend a business model from a period in the past when most people still went to a shop to buy records. At that time, it was mainly big non-European companies such as Sony that were making large amounts of money and they treated their artists as if they owned them. Anyone who defends this sort of monopoly is failing to support the interests of the artists. I hope that tomorrow’s vote will be a good moment for democracy and for the importance of the European Parliament and that it will allow us to put an end to ACTA. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is not just the European Union that is experiencing economically difficult times. Japan, too, finds itself in a long struggle, which was made even worse by the disaster last year. The EU’s trade agreement with South Korea, a direct competitor of Japan, put the government and businesses of that country under pressure, and that also affects the jobs and overall social situation in Japan. However, while many European governments are often quickly enthused by agreements with developing countries, as these are always negotiated to the advantage of European businesses and investors, the conservatives – including in this House – are currently applying the brakes to the talks with Japan. Aware of Japan’s dire straits, some are even calling for the Japanese to kowtow before real negotiations can take place. Ladies and gentlemen, friends prove themselves in times of trouble. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be ill-advised – as certainly all of us in this House would be, too – to categorise Japan as a beggar now, rather than a partner. The dispute about non-tariff barriers to trade is also something that we should resolve eye-to-eye at the negotiating table. In those negotiations, our aim should not be to cut as many laws as possible that our trading partner has developed. We need to analyse the regulations in dispute based on their purpose and aim in order to achieve a result that provides the social benefit required but which, at the same time, favours the trade of products, without, for example, reducing levels of consumer protection or environmental targets. In addition, we also take very seriously the concerns of Japanese farmers, who see their livelihoods threatened by future European agricultural exports. Similarly, there must be no agreement if the interests of the people of Europe are not safeguarded. My group will certainly not vote in favour of any treaty in which the investment protection chapter grants companies a right of action against governments or the EU.

 Thank you, Mr Caspary. In response to your first question, I do believe it very likely that all or many of the groups jointly submitted this draft resolution. Nonetheless, the questions I asked are of pressing interest, including because they are accepted and considered not merely by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but by all the groups. That is why I pointed out that we need to make progress here with the negotiations. In that regard, it needs to be more than just scoping. We need to go a step further and, as Mr Lange said, also incorporate this consideration when issuing the mandate. The answers to the second and third questions I will provide to Mr Caspary in person.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with this compromise, the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, are asking for Parliament’s consent for a reform that would abolish the European Union’s trade preferences for a number of poor countries. This fact is concealing itself behind the debate about the criteria into which we have already entered, including today. A completely arbitrary limit value has been set on per capita average income, which just happens to exceed USD 4 000 per annum. However, this value tells us nothing about the real distribution of income in many countries. In particular, the inconsistency of development processes in each country is not covered. Do you recall the Treaty of Lisbon? The elimination of poverty is a coherent goal of the foreign policy of the European Union. Your reform will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in countries like Ecuador, thus tipping women, predominantly, back into poverty. I believe that the motivation is clear, and it has even been publicly acknowledged by the rapporteur. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Fjellner for his openness and the mutual respect shown during the debate on this. Countries such as Ecuador are to be forced to conclude a direct free trade agreement with the European Union. We have seen the simple peddling of the argument that the reform aims to help the least developed countries. You are aware of that yourself, as trade potentials will not shift to the weak, but to the strong. Mr Lange, every major development organisation, this House’s Committee on Development, as well as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and numerous national trade unions have leant their support to the amendments and the trend through which we are seeking to revise this regulation. We will bring these amendments up again with Members in plenary, and I strongly urge you to support these amendments and thus help ensure that the European Union does not withdraw from the global fight against poverty.

– Mr President, the Policy Department’s study ‘EU macro-financial assistance: a critical assessment’ provides a useful and telling assessment of MFA operations so far. It shows the impact of both the scope and the volume of the loans and grants to be very marginal in many cases. The new procedures under the Treaty of Lisbon make the process of applying MFA more cumbersome. The consent of Parliament is now necessary for all applications of the MFA, and we understand the willingness of the Commission to simplify the procedures. Mr Kazak – whom I thank, on my own behalf and that of our shadow rapporteur, for his cooperation – proposes to apply the delegated acts procedure in respect of eligible countries and granting assistance to particular countries. As a group, we support this view. Our group is not against the imposition of some conditions but they must be the right ones. Our group considers it a serious mistake to continue to impose, within the framework of the MFA, the same conditions imposed by the IMF. We need to address these challenges, in particular in the light of the current financial and economic crisis. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our citizens are increasingly losing confidence in the European Union and the application of the law practised by its policies in many areas, Mr Martin’s own-initiative report can only be welcomed, and I would like to expressly lend my group’s support to this own-initiative report. It concerns taking further practical steps to assert the right explicitly laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Parliament’s task of exercising political control. I therefore do not agree with the previous speaker that we should not expand the right of inquiry or the rights of the European Parliament in this way, for how can and should Article 226 intervene in practice, in concrete terms, if it becomes necessary to set up temporary committees of inquiry in order to uncover and put a stop to, and I quote:  ‘alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law’. (DE)
 We need a permanent inquiry procedure that functions in real terms, is transparent and creates transparency. Inquiry proceedings do indeed have an important role to play in a parliamentary democracy. They allow parliaments to examine the facts independently and autonomously where they consider this necessary in order to perform their constitutional task of representing citizens. I believe this to be urgently necessary, particularly in the situation which the European Union finds itself at present. One final thought to close: I agree with those Members who have said that minority conclusions are urgently needed. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the coming week, the Chinese Minister for Commerce, Chen Deming, will be holding official talks with Mr De Gucht in Brussels. In this respect, this debate is taking place at the right time and the Chinese will be paying considerable attention to the expectations and opinions of the European Parliament. Ms de Sarnez, despite the constructive cooperation and the many individual points in your report which were correct and which I would like to thank you for, I cannot vote in favour of your report. Everyday life in businesses in Europe, the closure of traditional manufacturing plants, for example, in the textile industry and in the new industries of the future, such as the solar sector, the supply of raw materials to both these huge markets, the challenges involved in global trade and the complexity of current economic policy, in particular against the background of the financial, economic and structural crisis, the challenges of climate change and the current logic of production and growth all show that the report falls short of what we would like to see. We are taking too small a step, even if we perhaps do not need a new major leap forwards. We cannot simply continue our trade and economic policy as before with China and with other so-called emerging markets. We must investigate our business relations, address the contradictions and problems openly and establish clear contractual terms. However, all of this can only take place in the context of developing a common, agreed strategy for cooperation in a genuinely globalised world economy. To achieve this, we need intelligent, forward-looking initiatives. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Aung San Suu Kyi, one of the most symbolic political figures in the world, is once again taking part in the process of shaping her country. The overwhelming support which she received during her election to parliament clearly demonstrates that she carries the hopes of the Burmese people. However, I would like to make it clear that the parliament to which she was elected does not have the power to take the country in a different direction from that planned by the military. In addition, the generals have adopted a constitution which guarantees that they retain control over parliament in future. President Thein Sein could give a clear indication of how serious his desire for change is by not attempting to force the newly elected members to swear to support this obsolete constitution before they are allowed to take up their mandate. I am happy to acknowledge that a series of positive changes have taken place over the last two years. However, I agree with all my fellow Members that the country still has a long way to go. The spotlight on Aung San Suu Kyi must not blind us to the fate of other political prisoners, to the ongoing military action against parts of the population, to the misery of the refugees and to the wealth of a small elite in a desperately poor country. Is real change now on the way or will there be new setbacks? My group supports the call from Aung San Suu Kyi to suspend EU sanctions, but not to lift them permanently. This would give her country the opportunity to overcome poverty and encourage the military to continue along the road to democracy. However, it would also allow us to show that the European Parliament remains vigilant and that a return to dictatorship would have serious consequences. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Füle, my group has been following the developments in Iceland over the last few years and the ongoing and intensive accession negotiations with great attention and sympathy. We see Iceland primarily from the perspective of a country with a very small population which has not only succeeded in bringing about social change in recent years, but has also drawn conclusions about how to resolve the causes of the crisis and taken the necessary measures. We believe that Iceland is very much on the right track. Therefore, my group is also asking itself whether Iceland can bring its experiences, for example, in the area of sustainable energy policy, into the accession process and ultimately into Europe. Some of the solutions it has put in place go far beyond the measures taken to overcome the crisis in the EU. That is what the accession negotiations are essentially about. This presupposes that the negotiations are not only transparent and constructive, but are also on an equal footing as far as their content is concerned and do not have a predetermined outcome. Some of my fellow Members would like to believe that the domestic political situation in Iceland and the accession process are not efficient in political terms. However, the key political consideration is something quite different. The population of Iceland, which, by the way, is very pro-European, because many Icelanders have studied and worked in Europe, has high expectations of the negotiations. Nevertheless, the people of Iceland do not want accession at any price. In the end, they have to weigh up the results. This is a highly democratic process which we should welcome and support. I would like to thank Mr Preda for his very balanced report, but on the basis of these considerations, my group will be abstaining from voting. Why is this? Against the background of what I have said, the report contains points that we cannot support. Two examples of these are that if we accept, as my group does, that the accession process will remain open until the final evaluation of the results of the negotiations, we cannot behave now as if the decision had already been made. Secondly, the report calls in paragraph 5 for a reduction in the state’s influence on the banking sector. However, Iceland had particular challenges to overcome in this area, which we must not ignore. Instead, we must assess what has been done and make use of the findings. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address my words expressly to Mr Swoboda. Your first motion for a resolution was pleasantly balanced and specifically unemotional with regard to what can be said following the presidential elections. In signing the European Convention on Human Rights, the Russian leadership made a voluntary commitment that it is not fulfilling. These elections, too, were once again not fair or free of fraud. Even a EUR 300 million investment in surveillance technology by the government did not solve a problem that can only be solved at a political level. These are the sober facts that do not leave us, as a partner, indifferent. They also highlight the contradictory nature of a Russian society, which, as everyone can see, is nevertheless changing. This is something we should welcome and support, because emerging democracies thrive on efforts to develop and change, and also on protests. Russia is becoming normal. I therefore consider a number of the conclusions drawn by some of my colleagues here in Parliament to be politically wrong. There must be no compromises in the text here, either. This House must finally decide what line it wants to take. At the ‘Russia after the Elections’ event yesterday, organised by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I discovered that some Members are of the opinion that Russia is no longer normal. Was it ever normal? They believe it represents a potential danger and that we cannot simply carry on as before, but must now finally take a different course. I would just like to say something about this. Those who want to think in terms of escalation spirals should now explain how far they want to go with this and, moreover, not only in terms of where that leaves our partnership. For all the justified criticism and all of the differences, partnership for me means, above all, a balance in terms of our common interests, and, at least in my mother tongue, partnership and subordination are not synonyms. People who advocate this path are also saying, as far as I can see, that they do not believe in the power of society to change and that they have not taken note of the changes in Russian society, to which, incidentally, the reports of the election observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) also refer, as here is where alternatives to the Putin-steered democracy are being sought. All of this must, ultimately, be discussed in political terms. The dynamism that some people are currently developing here in this House following the elections is something that I consider to be disconcerting, however. In my view, it cannot be reconciled with the political dignity and self-perception of a House that stands for plurality in Europe if representatives of part of the Russian opposition here in Strasbourg were able, unchallenged, to discredit the alternative presidential candidates by describing them simply as ‘Putin’s pigs’, when these candidates, without rectification of the election fraud, received the vote of more than 25 million citizens in Russia. Despite knowledge to the contrary, these same people have been speaking for weeks in this House, likewise unchallenged, of the possible bloodshed caused by Mr Putin and of potential revolutions. All I can say is that it is not the clear majority in this House that is deliberately taking the wrong course in its criticism of the elections in Russia. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, it is important that on the second occasion in only a short period of time, the European Parliament is condemning the abuse of children who are used as cheap labour or slaves. We are in favour of this agreement. Nevertheless, in the Committee on International Trade, we had a shameful debate about whether we should condemn only forced child labour or also child labour under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In two areas, we may be forced to take a step backwards and, therefore, we need to resolve the issues involved. Mr Sturdy, recital E, which has been tabled by your group, gives the impression that the hard work done by children on the cocoa plantations is harmless. These children are being deprived of the opportunity to take part in education and their future is being taken away from them. We should delete this paragraph. Ms Köstinger and the other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which tabled recital D, want Parliament to turn a blind eye to the fact that children are being abducted and sold in West Africa to do hard and dangerous forced labour on the cocoa plantations. This is the appalling reality in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in particular, as has already been mentioned. I recommend that you watch the documentary ‘The Dark Side of Chocolate’, which reveals that a child costs EUR 230. The children are being abducted from Mali and the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are more than 12 000 children without relations working on the Ivorian plantations. The next time we eat chocolate, we should specifically ask ourselves how many children have suffered to give us this pleasure. We must take a much more decisive approach to combating this problem.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, discussions between the partners about what annoys them and about what changes would increase the common ground between them are an undoubted part of strategic partnerships. More than one area of this kind exists. Therefore, it is increasingly surprising that this House is content simply to give a mutual confirmation of its values. The results of the poll in Russia yesterday should be making us think much more carefully about the situation. The poll showed that the Russian population wants a modern country with a stable economy which is more than just an exporter of raw materials. However, only 7% of the population believes that the EU is prepared to help with the necessary reconstruction. This figure has not only halved, but is also particularly low in areas which are in close contact with the EU. We should be discussing the related issues here, including democratic values, involvement in society, the prospects of the election and the emergence of a political and civil society in the Russian Federation, particularly against the background of the contradictory experiences of the Russian people during the Yeltsin era. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, a strategic partnership must involve a balance of interests on key issues, including people’s living conditions, business relationships based on equal opportunities and the joint challenges that we have to resolve. ‘Strategic’ means giving priority to our common interests as part of this balance. It also means making concrete achievements, ensuring that the political decision-making processes are transparent for everyone, and explaining the electoral procedures. We agree on the fact that nothing can happen without joint security. However, it is difficult to understand why joint security is not being established jointly. The proposals for discussion have been put on the table, including by the EU. The next summit must deal with these proposals. It must come to a binding agreement that the money used to buy more weapons would be better spent on the specific processes for establishing the modernisation partnership. This is in the interest of both sides and also in the interest of our citizens, who want to have their fair share of the economic progress. A prospering economy and a fair society will ultimately make obsolete the arrogant behaviour which comes with power. A society of this kind needs the competence and commitment of all its citizens. The Russian demonstrators made this clear to their government in Bolotnaya Square on Saturday and called for concrete change. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I took over this dossier, I quite honestly did not expect to be negotiating it intensively for more than two years. In my view, that is certainly difficult to explain to the general public, both to citizens within the EU and also to people in our partner countries. It is worth noting that, with regard to the negotiations on the actual content and the tasks of the instrument, it was possible to reach an agreement in a few months. What caused the negotiations to drag on so long was the interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon in respect of the delegated acts and the refusal of some large Member States to actually allow Parliament greater powers of scrutiny. The Council and the European Parliament agreed at an early stage to thoroughly revise the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. We planned to release up to EUR 348 million for cooperation in the fields of science, academic exchanges – including the Erasmus Mundus programme – culture, environmental protection and renewable energy sources and the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration was to be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. That remains the case, but the delay has meant that it will only be possible for a considerably smaller amount to be invested by the end of the current financial framework. That is particularly regrettable because, with the new ICI+, projects in developing countries can also be financed, and this involves projects that do not fall within the general definition of development assistance measures, for example sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America. In the amended regulation we have made clear reference to the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It is clearly stated for whom and for what purpose the additional funds are to be used according to the intentions of the legislators. In the developing countries listed in Annex II, at least 5% of the funds are to be spent in the area of public diplomacy. In specific terms, that means the promotion of dialogue with civil society with regard to the character and fundamental values of the European Union, namely democracy, respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms. At least 20% of the funds are to be invested in the promotion of direct relations between the citizens of the European Union and the partner countries. In addition to an emphasis on academic exchange and the mobility of students, this also involves the interlinking of economic, social and cultural players. At least 50% of the funds are to be spent on the interlinking of economic activities, with the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. The funds are to go mainly to partner countries which comply with the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation and which are involved in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is a new element. With regard to cooperation in the energy sector, the Commission is in any case required to concentrate in particular on cooperation in the area of renewable energy. For the purpose of the minutes and for the information of the Commission and the supervisory authorities: this instrument is expressly not to be used to provide hidden subsidies for the operation of a European telephone company in Colombia or any other country in Latin America. I consider it extremely important and necessary to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. We in Parliament will continually monitor this. For this purpose, we have enshrined in this instrument a special reporting obligation on the part of the Commission – this is a success too. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulation is in line with the spirit of the legislators. In the past the Commission has unfortunately often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. We therefore wanted to enshrine the delegated acts in this instrument and to demand our role and duty as legislators with a right of veto. Therefore, in the interests of those who benefit from the support programme, we did not in the end insist on the relevant wording, but with this instrument as with all the others – and on this point I agree with the other rapporteurs – we will also fight for this democratic right in future too. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only agree with Mr Goerens’s criticism of the Council, as I too would have very much liked to have seen the Council here today. Nevertheless, after all the fine words about compromise and also the areas of disagreement listed at the end of the debate, I would like to take the opportunity to point out once again that the Commission should now submit a completely revised strategy paper for the ICI+. It would be unacceptable for us as legislators to give the instrument a completely new direction and then for the Commission to simply continue with the old strategy paper, which was drawn up even before the legislative amendment and therefore had the old ‘Global Europe’ communication as its reference document. Instead, the legislators have given the regulation a completely new tenor, namely that of a partnership approach and mutual benefit. The legislators are placing the regulation in the context of other key policy goals of the European Union, in particular coherence with development policy, the enforcement of international labour law standards and the combating of climate change. However, the strategy paper continues to ignore this intention, maintaining that the goal of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. As legislators, that was not what we aimed to achieve with this instrument and the corresponding money from taxpayers. The ICI+ is intended to be a modern cooperation programme, not a weapon of conquest. Commissioner, in my view you still have an obligation to implement the will of the legislators in future, too. We do not want to write planning and strategy papers ourselves. We have repeatedly made that clear. That is something that the Commission should continue to do. However, we will utilise our right of veto if the requirements that we have written down have been ignored. Therefore, the proposals for the new generation of financing instruments must employ the principle of the delegated acts wisely. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks there has at last been a positive signal from the US that has made the world sit up and listen. However, this signal did not come from the White House, nor from the Capitol, but from the street. With the Occupy movement, the American people have set an example of resistance against the dictates of financial capitalism that have been followed and seized upon throughout the world. Yesterday, the tents of the protesters were cleared away and numerous people were arrested by the police under the cover of darkness throughout the US in what was clearly a concerted action on the part of the mayors. That is also a signal, indicating the refusal of those in power to take up the demands of the people. However, this is precisely the demand that my group would make of a transatlantic summit. It is not the people who should be arrested, but the fraudsters who are becoming ever richer on profits from subprime credits. The summit, coming just after the G20 summit, ought to consider how wide the gap is now getting between the poor majority of the population and the super rich. The summit ought to take firm decisions concerning the prohibition of usurious interest, whether for private individuals or for entire states. It ought to open its eyes and see that 10% of the population of the United States and the Member States of the EU is now out of work. A quarter of young people have no prospects, and in many regions the figure is even higher than 40%. The financial markets suck the necessary investment capital out of the real economy and out of the national exchequers and deprive them of profits. These enormous problems must be addressed at the summit. To solve these problems we need a new high-quality partnership for cooperation between the US Congress, the European Parliament and the parliaments of the EU Member States in order to define common approaches for the legislation that is urgently needed. An expanded TLD would also be the appropriate forum for addressing further differences between the EU and the US, whether this is – using the list of topics that you mentioned – in peace policy, climate policy or in connection with rights to privacy. As Mr Bütikofer said, the resolution is a long way from achieving this. As a group, therefore, we cannot give the resolution our backing. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, like many of my fellow Members, I would also like to say that we need to be honest and admit that the central task for the Commission in 2012 is nothing less than holding together the European Union. We need to take a joint approach to developing it further. We need more Europe. We must stick together in the interest of the citizens and we must not allow individual Member States to be exposed to attacks from financial capitalism. However, more Europe must not mean less democracy. In 2012, we will undoubtedly have to lay the foundations for the future development of the European Union, which will perhaps come close to being a state. However, in this Europe which resembles a state, decisions must not be made by decree by the Council and the Commission. The groundwork carried out by the Commission for the convention in 2012 must not result in the citizens of Europe and their parliaments being disenfranchised. Instead, we need a more democratic Europe with a focus on peace, environmental change and social progress. Do you not realise, Mr Barroso, that you and the Commission are increasingly being regarded by the people of Greece, Portugal and Italy as their enemy? The Council has succeeded in making you the scapegoat. Brussels is ordering the privatisation of state assets, cuts in wages and pensions, and the removal of protection against dismissal. This is all pure neoliberalism. Stop, Mr Barroso! You must finally turn the Commission into the ally of the citizens. You must defend people against the effects of greed and join with us in 2012 in bringing an end to the business model that has driven entire states to the brink of ruin with extortionate interest rates. You must stop feeding the predators. Instead, you must channel the funds into urgently needed investments in the future and make the financial transaction tax your touchstone. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, what we are discussing here relates to international economic cooperation. We often discuss the financial crisis and rescuing the banks and the euro. Incredible sums of money have been made available that should have been enough to boost employment throughout the world and thereby conquer hunger. We talk far too little about the people whose real existence the crisis has hit. The banks that we are to rescue have driven millions of people into unemployment through their speculation whilst also, at the same time, irresponsibly gambling with people’s pension funds. With the American Jobs Act, President Obama is seeking to finally put the fate of these people back at the heart of politics. His idea of removing financial burdens from businesses that take on new employees is a good one. European policy should learn from the example that the United States is setting. The non-policy of strangling the life out of the economy through lunatic austerity measures must be brought to an end. In difficult times like these, I also give my firm backing to the use of public procurement resources to promote local production. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, whoever it is sitting over there, I urge you to use the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council in December to tackle the issue of unemployment in a concerted manner in this context and to prevent a downward spiral, while counselling a joint new start for economic, employment and social policy. Be sure that the European Parliament will be very actively involved in the transatlantic dialogue between legislators. The Occupy Wall Street movement has not only earned the support of millions of Americans; it will, I hope, also act as an inspiration for the population of Europe. Helmut Scholz,

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Caspary, I acknowledge the fact that, as rapporteur, you have shown yourself within your own group to be thoroughly open to the demand for a modern trade policy with this report. Paragraph 5 of your report in particular emphasises the fact, at last, that trade policy requires coherence with a great many other policy areas as well as future viability, and I expressly support your call for a thorough revision of the trade strategy by Commissioner De Gucht. Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of this report then falls back into the old way of thinking. You want to promote the interests of the EU instead of establishing partnerships. You support an aggressive market access strategy by the Commission, which would weaken the development potential of other countries. You want to use whatever means necessary to secure access to raw materials for European enterprises instead of finally offering fair prices and providing assistance for the development of manufacturing industries. We will vote against this old way of thinking, because the consequence of continuing with this old strategy will, above all, be the extension of the spiral of poverty in most parts of the world. That is short-sighted, also because it will ultimately harm Europe. How do you actually imagine it will end if we pursue competition for the raw materials of the world by aggressive means? Where will we be in 2050? Will all of the states in the world then have a raw materials management strategy like that of Norway? Will it have been possible to develop manufacturing industries? Will Europe have helped them to do this in an environmentally sound way and to create respectable jobs? Europe’s future lies in a smart trade policy that aims to strengthen its partners and which recognises that combating poverty is a prerequisite for its own survival. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I have a question for Commissioner De Gucht. I have just been appointed as a European Parliament standing rapporteur on trade relations with China, as well as on relations between the EU and Ecuador and Bolivia. I would like to ask you two questions regarding these two complexes. Firstly, what is your projection for the development of trade relations between the EU and China by the year 2020, and what are the current issues, or even agreements, in EU-China trade talks? Secondly, you informed yesterday’s Council on Foreign Affairs and Trade that the multiparty agreement with Colombia and Peru remains open for signature by Ecuador and Bolivia. Do you want those two countries to simply sign the negotiated text which is, as you well know, subject to well-founded criticism from trade unions and a number of economists? Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I can agree with your remark concerning the last issue, but that means that if Ecuador wants to have a chapter on trade and cooperation included, as is just now under discussion, and also the specific needs of the new raw materials and public services policy pursued by Bolivia are to be included, then I think we have to come to the point where we have to add this point to the negotiations as well; so not just to simply sign or not sign, but to reopen the understanding of the agreement itself.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this agreement, as a result of which Palestinian agricultural products will now actually be placed on an equal footing with products from other, recognised states in the Mediterranean. I expressly agree with the rapporteur – and I would like to thank her for her work – when she says that this Agreement can help, to a certain degree, to support and strengthen the Palestinian economy, which is currently in crisis, irrespective of the aspects of this Agreement that are still unresolved, to which my fellow Members have referred. How is a permanent peace solution with Israel to be possible if there is no self-supporting economic development in the future state of Palestine, which also is and must be the basis for further democratisation and an embedding of Palestinian society in the region as a whole – I would like to emphasise this point – for dealing with such complex problems as demographic issues, job creation, issues relating to water supply, the construction of housing, and so on, in a constructive and positive way? I also see this as an important signal in view of the current debate in the United Nations with regard to the long overdue recognition of the state of Palestine. Trade policy – and this is specifically addressed to you – can create specific circumstances here that would signify a tangible improvement in living conditions for the local people. That also involves us taking on specific responsibility for the Arab Spring this autumn. This Agreement can surely only be a first step towards comprehensive trade cooperation as partners. In light, in particular, of the important global political decision, however, I would also like, here in plenary, to explicitly express my amazement at the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Up until just before the vote in committee, it threatened to reject the Agreement. As the price for its consent in the Committee on International Trade, it forced the deletion from Parliament’s explanatory statement of the reference to the settlements and blockades by Israel being partly to blame for the poverty and unemployment in Palestine. Shutting our eyes to reality is not a valid position to take, and the facts and challenges still remain. The same applies to the question of the deletion of the passage relating to the circumvention of the rules of origin by Israeli manufacturers. We will not solve the problem by not allowing a spade to be called a spade. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, the resolution that will be passed by the European Parliament gives you a clear mandate in this critical phase of the Doha negotiations: you must press for a positive interim result at multilateral level in Geneva that will contribute to a reduction in the poverty suffered in the world. Everyone gathered here today recognises the status quo, which is why we must have an eye to the future – as Mr Taylor has just said: do you remember the start of these talks? The Doha Round was instigated 10 years ago in the shadow of the attacks in New York and the intention was to contribute to an improvement in living conditions in developing countries by further developing the WTO, thus eliminating the basis for the propaganda of hatred. However, the Commission’s negotiators and those of its competitors are mainly concentrating on the opening up of the global markets for services and penetration into previously protected sectors of general public interest. Developing countries were able to come together within the WTO to prevent this opening up from being forced upon them. In turn, you responded by switching the emphasis to the conclusion of bilateral agreements that enabled you to pursue your chief interests more effectively. This approach has patently failed to help reduce poverty. It actually threatens the establishment of a system of fair trade rules with worldwide validity under the umbrella of the WTO. For this reason, my group urgently calls on you to return to the primacy of multilateral agreement. The least you should do in Geneva is to obtain an agreement for the so-called least developed countries package, which would bring improvements for the world’s poorest. We would also call on you to withdraw the Commission’s threat to abandon the promise to abolish the EU’s export subsidies for agricultural produce should the Doha Round fail. In view of the present catastrophic famine in East Africa and the increasingly difficult situation of the farmers – not just in the developing countries, but there in particular – it is actually necessary to speed up the abolition of export subsidies.

 Madam President, in light of the scope to act that we are afforded as Parliament, we really have to ask, ladies and gentlemen, whether we, too, have sufficient legitimacy for our actions here. Mr Duff’s report – and I very much welcome the many years of work that he has carried out – puts forward specific proposals for strengthening the European element. Some of these will clearly not receive majority support, but he is taking the right approach and it deserves broad support and a public debate, including outside this Chamber. In our group, too, there were heated debates about the specific proposals in the report. This reflects the divergent interests in, and experience with, the European Union. On one point there is agreement. Parliament is not the only place for discussing and taking decisions concerning democracy. Therefore, I give my clear support to the approach taken in the report, which I believe is the right one, and to the report’s call, right from the outset, to go well beyond the negotiating mandate towards the Council. Citizens must be given their own voice in this process and the European political parties must be active in this regard. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, it is not the first time that we have discussed the Arab countries and the upheavals there. While we are debating the developments that have taken place from Syria to Morocco, in my opinion, Parliament is also reappraising its own past, in other words, the cooperation that was at least tolerated between the European Union and countries which we rightly refer to today as having autocratic regimes and whose internal structures we are concerned about. This is a good thing. However, I cannot help but get the impression that we have once again started to relax in the supposed certainty that everything is under control and everything will be all right. The thing which I personally find impossible to deal with is that we are continuing to comment on political processes, but we are still not prepared to put these developments in their national and regional social context and to investigate the causes of these changes. We must finally stop applying double standards in our foreign policy and also in our democratic dealings with one another. We should talk about the interrelationships between EU Neighbourhood Policy and EU policy on the failure to resolve the Palestinian conflict. I very much welcome your commitment to the Quartet. We should discuss the fact that the war against Colonel Gaddafi’s autocratic regime, which some EU Member States and NATO are involved in, is already having dramatic economic consequences in Tunisia. The outflow of capital, Tunisians returning home to look for work, migrants, a collapse in the country’s income from tourism and in its trade relationships are just some of the issues. This war is also playing into the hands of the powers in the military and the political elite in Egypt who want to return to the previous regime. We are now dealing not just with new problems and no longer only with old problems. Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, we need a fundamental political and economic reorientation of the European Union’s foreign policy activities. I believe that this has become clear during the course of this debate. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations with Canada are being conducted with a country that has a strong economy and a highly developed legal system. It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate, if not conceal, an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court. Why ever should an ordinary court not decide on compensation in cases of doubt? Which courts do you, as the Commission, not have any trust in whatsoever? Is it the Canadian courts or those in the European Union? Do you not see that, with this part of the agreement, you would be discriminating against the local undertakings? As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission’s approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a ‘negative list’. This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open. We want to retain public services. I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada’s social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter. The European Parliament is also calling for the protection of workers, payment of overtime, minimum wages and rejection of social dumping. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now almost a year since the people of Pakistan suffered devastating floods. We all have very close ties with the people of this stricken country. What is scandalous, however, is the fact that the negotiations in the WTO are still dragging on, and that alone makes it clear that this form of trade facilitation is not suitable to be used as an emergency aid measure. My group has repeatedly called on the Commission to put forward a plan B in order to be able to help the people of Pakistan quickly and permanently to rebuild their country. No alternative solution has been presented, however. Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council, which it is only too familiar with. Otherwise, it would seem as if the difficult negotiations in the WTO are being used as an excuse for the lack of action. You knew as well as we did that these negotiations would be difficult before they even started and you probably also already knew this when some of the foreign ministers from Germany and other Member States sent you on this mission. After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection. It is precisely this status advantage that enables Bangladesh to import primary products from Pakistan, to process them and then export them to Europe. It is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance. However, we cannot in all honesty expect approval for our desire to help Pakistan at the expense of one of the poorest countries in the world. By doing so, we will ultimately damage ourselves, too, and indeed we will be doing this on the eve of the presentation of the new Commission draft on the revision of our system of trade preferences. My solution to this problem is therefore as follows: place the focus on direct aid for the reconstruction following the floods and take immediate action instead of losing in the negotiations in Geneva. After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the motions for resolutions that the European Parliament has been presented with make it clear to all groups that Parliament – as has already been emphasised – does not feel it is sufficiently informed about the specific status of the negotiations. I am therefore grateful for the more detailed information that we have been given today. The questions from the left side of this House in particular deal directly with the concerns of the people in Europe, but also in India, and these are concerns for their own social and economic situation and the prospects of workers and those looking for work, including in the EU Member States. As we know, the devil is in the detail, so we would like to know the following, Commissioner: what are the specific subjects of the negotiations when it comes to public invitations to tender in the services sector or in connection with labour migration? What text is on the table with regard to intellectual property rights? What is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture? By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world’s poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies. We want to examine whether European local authorities, hospitals or ministries are, in future, to be obliged to make calls for tenders in which Indian companies can also be included. We want to know whether the agreement will regulate the conditions of entry into the Member States of the European Union of Indian nurses or carers for the elderly, including the length of stay and recognition of qualifications. We want to know whether the agreement text will put small-scale farmers and fishermen in India at risk and whether European steel workers are threatened with redundancy because Indian capital will, in future, be able to be invested freely in the purchase of companies in the EU as a result of the agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, just one topic should be the focus of attention when the summit is held between the European Union and Japan at the end of this month: the disaster that has devastated the people of Japan as a result of earthquakes, the tsunami and continuing radioactive contamination, and the concrete role that can be played by the EU, its Member States and individual citizens in helping to deal with the resulting problems in the short, medium and long term. That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people. We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster – particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan. The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy. The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident. For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle. In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement. Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides. That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan. For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work and for trying, in the spirit of the European Parliament, to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides, and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis. This is not a simple issue. It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States with regard to social, economic and employment policy, weighing up the interests of financial groups, big business and economic enterprises, on the one hand, and those of the trade unions and workers on the other. That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen’s should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament. For this reason, I hope that tomorrow’s vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr Füle, Mr Siwiec, thank you for devoting yourself to this subject. Parliament’s almost unanimous opinion is that Neighbourhood Policy has not produced the expected results. I agree with that. However, I do not agree with the analysis of the causes. The results do not meet our expectations because we have not focused on the interests which we have in common with our neighbours. Instead, we have concentrated on our own interests and on our ideas of how neighbouring countries should develop. Quite obviously, what we need is a different approach. We need a policy which makes cooperation between both sides a central principle and which respects the sovereign right of the citizens in the partner countries to shape their future without outside interference. The content of the policy must focus on our common European challenges and transform partnership policy into a permanent tool for genuine cooperative discussions and for identifying solutions to joint problems. We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is taking a serious-minded and practical approach to the issue of the democratisation of European decision-making processes. As Mrs Giannakou’s report shows, this approach also involves the further development of European parties, which, although they have been an everyday political reality in Europe for many years, until now have not been equal partners and players in terms of their democratic influence on EU policy. We need political parties at EU level too that are firmly rooted in the societies they represent and that can play a strong role in the elections to the European Parliament and in establishing European openness, based on internal democratic structures and regulations. With regard to this particular report, I must say that I would have liked the rapporteur to have shown a great deal more courage by using the Parliament’s right of initiative to take a truly significant step in developing the political system and the party system in the European Union. This is a step that many citizens have been waiting for and that will encourage them to get involved. The interlocking European and national decision-making levels and the relations between the political parties could have been addressed more clearly as a common factor that is transparent and open to influence. The European Parliament should now decisively call on the Commission and Council to take the initiative in this regard. I would expect constructive cooperation from the Commission and Council.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate. However, I would like to mention two aspects. The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade. The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters. Therefore, my group will not support these amendments. Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology. This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers. We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important aspect of international trade policy very late in the day. Given its importance, I would have preferred the House to be full, with all the seats occupied. The European Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a major achievement of European trade policy. It opens up our market to the poorest countries in the world for all types of goods except arms. It also gives developing countries trade concessions on a whole range of products. GSP+ is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights, labour standards and protecting the environment. However, the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly. Over the years, the European Parliament, partner countries, companies and non-governmental organisations have made important suggestions for improving the system. The whole world is now waiting for the Commission to issue its proposal on the much-needed revision of the system. The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010. The Commission has not delivered on time and its failure to do so has left the countries involved and companies both inside and outside the EU in a dangerous state of uncertainty. The existing regulation must now be revised. You are attempting to rescue the situation by means of a transitional regulation and this is what we will be voting on tomorrow, that is on Thursday. The transitional regulation is simply an extension. It does not change anything, it does not improve anything and it does not implement the new requirements resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and, as the rapporteur, I have felt the same. It is the obligation of the Members of this Parliament to ensure that the rights, the duties and also the powers granted to the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe by the Treaty of Lisbon are respected. It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries. In order to protect the EU’s partners from the consequences of a long-drawn-out procedure, I suggested initially to the Committee on International Trade that only those elements of the regulation should be amended which are necessary to allow Parliament to fulfil its new role. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that I also believe a general redrafting of the GSP and GSP+ schemes is needed. During the intensive meetings with the Council and the Commission on the legal issues resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon which affect the transitional regulation, Parliament finally decided to take a big leap of faith. At this point, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to the chair of the Committee on International Trade, Professor Moreira, for his untiring efforts as mediator and also to you, Mr De Gucht, for the Commission’s assurance that key amendments, in particular with regard to informing and involving Parliament, would be addressed in practice. Therefore, we decided to drop all our amendments, in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible. We did this primarily in the interests of our partners and of the companies which are affected. The Commission’s assurance includes a promise in future to inform the European Parliament in full, immediately and at the same time as the Council about work relating to essential aspects of the GSP and about all developments and to share all documents relating to the GSP. The Commission also guarantees that the European Parliament will be notified about any suspension of preferences, in accordance with Article 16(3), about withdrawals, including the corresponding investigation reports from the Commission, in accordance with Article 17, and about safeguard decisions, in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, before they come into force. We welcome the tabling of Omnibus 1 and the Commission’s readiness to enter into an in-depth discussion of the proposals which it has made in Omnibus 1. At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently. Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation. We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament’s parliamentary rights. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for working together so constructively. Now that we have finally agreed on the formal aspects of the transitional regulation, I would like to make use of this debate to explain briefly some of the requirements for the future regulation. The new version of the regulation should have the following basic objectives: 1. To increase the efficiency of the system; 2. To develop rules that will provide for a better regulated reform process in which the involvement of the beneficiaries is guaranteed; 3. To ensure that the regulation gives due weight to the task of democratic control which Parliament is required to perform. This includes proposals from the Committee on Development. The new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) should be a clearer and more transparent system. I would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin. The rules of origin and the administrative procedures that accompany them are one of the main reasons why the trade preferences granted by the GSP are being underused, particularly by the least developed countries. In the current version of the system, the rules of origin often prevent preferences that exist on paper from having a positive impact. I have just come back from the Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva and this problem was very high up on the list of issues discussed there. In my opinion, the EU should campaign within the WTO for the preference system to be given priority as part of its work on harmonising the rules of origin. My second point concerns the partner countries. Here I feel that it is particularly important for us to develop more straightforward criteria. The Gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion. As already mentioned, we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively. My third point is about technical assistance. Preferences alone are not enough. We need to increase the impact of the system and improve the rate of utilisation of the GSP by providing technical assistance. This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole. I would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach. I will be happy to continue working with the Commission on the basis of today’s assurances. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, only last autumn, the European Parliament specifically welcomed the fact that the Heads of State or Government of the European Union had explicitly recognised, in a statement from the Madrid Summit, the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural resources and to control their use. The statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criteria. The summit was attended by Latin American countries, but the same laws apply to China and other states. The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) has led to serious environmental damage in China, as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere. This must not continue. We need an international agreement. China and other potential producers need our expertise and technology transfer in order to ensure that their mining processes are environmentally friendly and that their miners can work in much greater safety. China is also interested in investing in high-tech production facilities for processing REEs, because it does not just want to be a supplier of raw materials. The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here. A modern raw materials policy must be characterised by partnership. At the same time, you must put the emphasis on developing improved recycling and substitution technologies, because in future, the metals found in REEs will become even rarer: too rare simply to use them once.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement signed in October 2010, which has been assigned the attribute by the Commission and the Council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the EU and a highly industrialised state, the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98% in the next five years. The trade exchange between the EU and Korea is supposed to double in the medium term and that – so it is said – will speed up economic growth and the creation of jobs and prosperity. My group and I have justified doubts about this prediction. Quite apart from the mantra of the role of free trade as a kind of saviour of the global economy that is currently in a precarious state, which is also reflected in the Free Trade Agreement itself, it is not clear from this agreement whether it will, or will able to, help us deal with the global challenges arising as a result of climate change and the necessary fundamental economic restructuring. What are the efficiency criteria and what are the free trade criteria? At the same time, Commissioner, the Free Trade Agreement that has been concluded hardly contains any references to sustainability for the future, oriented change or international economic cooperation. An agreement is being concluded in which the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation are still being contravened. (The President cut off the speaker.) Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term. We plan to jointly allocate up to EUR 348 million to cooperation in areas such as science, academic exchanges – including Erasmus Mundus –, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy, as well as the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration should be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. The new aspect is that with what is known as ICI Plus, projects in developing countries can now also be financed – and specifically projects that do not fall under the general definition of development aid measures. These include projects and measures such as sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America – a completely new element. In the current times, when the EU has a greater responsibility to realign its cooperation in partnership with a growing number of states, allowing self-determined development has a particular part to play in this. The recast of the regulation needs to clearly mark the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It clearly states who can obtain financial assistance, for what purposes and on what terms. Another new element of this instrument is that the regulation specifies that the allocation of funding must ensure that the partner countries comply with the core working standards of the International Labour Organisation and that they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an important contribution to the international fight against climate change. Equally important, the rule of law and human dignity in work are elevated to cooperation objectives. As we are going into the second reading, allow me to restate that I consider it essential to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. In the plenary vote at first reading it was decided – albeit by a narrow majority – that none of the funds allocated to development aid thus far should be devoted to ICI Plus. We are going into the second reading with an accelerated rapprochement on this, as on all the financing instruments. Following successful compromise negotiations between Council and the European Parliament we have adapted ICI Plus to the challenges of the future. All the matters of substance have been approved by a majority in plenary. So far, so good – or so it would seem. However, it remains undecided how we will deal in future with the division of powers between the two legislative bodies of the EU resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly in the area of communitarised international trade policy. The issue at stake here is democracy, and specifically what are known as delegated acts – which is something on which the European Parliament and the Commission and Council continue to have differing views. What is this all about? We want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulations is in accordance with the spirit of the legislator. In the past the Commission has unfortunately too often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us a new role and duty as a legislator, and we demand a right of veto. The rapporteurs for the various foreign policy financing instruments, the chairs of the committees and the leaders of the groups are all agreed that we must fight for this democratic right. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conduct we have seen so far shows that not all three bodies of the European Union have yet recognised this principle. We are therefore vigorously defending our right of control today because in future the Commission must base its planning on what the legislator has laid down, not on its own communications. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, you are absolutely right that the outside world does not understand why we cannot come to an agreement with the Council. The Council is not even present for this debate, which I very much regret, because that is not a good omen for the completion of the second reading. However, we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right, which are enshrined in the treaty, are not being recognised. I believe, and Mr Brok has discussed this in detail, that this is only about giving us the opportunity to intervene. Perhaps I can give one more example with regard to the content. In the Commission’s multiannual plan for my industrialised countries instrument (ICI), the reference document was not the amended regulation, but instead the Global Europe strategy. This uses language which has become obsolete since the advent of the economic crisis and the resulting trade problems when it says that the objective of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. I can only repeat that this is not what the legislators intended the instrument to achieve and they have not put aside any taxpayers’ money for this purpose. In our view, the ICI should be a modern cooperation programme and not a weapon of conquest. To give another example, this time in more blunt terms: For us, the countries of south-east Asia are not just junior partners, as the Commission has stated. As part of the cooperation with central Asia, the instrument must not focus solely on EU access to the gas reserves there. When we look at the Maghreb region and the developments in the Middle East, it is clear that we need to take a long-term, large-scale approach to cooperation. I hope that the new regulation will be future-proof. I also hope that this financing instrument will encourage exchanges on an equal footing between the EU and third countries and will help to create openness throughout the world and promote responsible support for sustainable development processes which are in the interests of citizens.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my group has not signed up to the compromise resolution on Belarus. However, I would like to make it clear that this should not be seen as an acceptance on our part of the results of the election, the arrests and the reprisals against those with differing opinions. For us, fair, transparent and democratic elections – ‘the freedom of dissenters’ to quote Rosa Luxemburg – are a basic requirement for establishing a relationship with Belarus and with all other states. This also includes the immediate release of all political detainees. However, I doubt whether sanctions are really an effective means of bringing about the immediate release of political prisoners and radical changes in the democratic system in Belarus. Sanctions have had little effect in the past in Belarus and elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, you are as well aware of this as I am. A better approach seems to me to be to confront those who hold political power with our arguments and demands in the context of a political dialogue, not to give them the opportunity to discredit the criticisms made by those in civil society by referring to external criticism, to establish a transparent political system and to coordinate our efforts with those of all our foreign policy partners in Belarus. This also seems to be more honest in relation to our own arguments, as this morning’s discussion on the Hungarian Presidency has shown. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I have two brief comments on the report: firstly, I believe it is right and good that with this report the European Parliament is getting involved in the debate on economic and monetary union. After all, this is an issue of such importance that it cannot be left to the Council alone. To date, in the management of the crisis the Council has proven to be more a stronghold of nationalism than a place where European solutions are developed. Secondly, economic and monetary union is not sufficient. During the crisis many citizens viewed the work of the European Union, Parliament, the Commission and the Council as a means of supporting the banks. Whether that is true in all cases is a moot point, but that is the experience of many citizens: the banks are being supported, while the social situation of many citizens is becoming increasingly precarious. It is not sufficient simply to talk about prosperity, as the spokesperson for the Council did. What is required is a social union that guarantees all citizens social rights. If we do not manage to achieve this, the EU will lose the support of citizens. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank my colleagues for the good work they have done together, but especially Mr Ferber. This has really been a very good, fair and open collaboration. It is not always this way, so it is much appreciated in this case. At this point I would also like to thank the non-governmental organisations. They made a significant contribution, especially in the area of food speculation. What may not be obvious, and I want to emphasise this, is that the rapporteur has also engaged in the process. It has not always been easy and comfortable. I do believe, however, that at that point it was very important and good that the non-governmental organisations were involved in working on this area. This process opened up the dry, heavy issue of financial market regulation a little to some of the people, the citizens. It does Parliament good to let such an important issue get out of this House a little. I echo what Mr Giegold said earlier. We have taken an important and good step in the area of food speculation. However, there are still a few questions with regard to omissions – there may still be a few loopholes there. Nevertheless, this will be revealed by experience and then we will have to re-work this area. I think that what we have done on high-frequency trading is very deserving of support: I – and, I believe, the majority of my Group – can wholeheartedly support it. This is also not a matter of course, but on that point we have succeeded in creating something good and practical. On commissions, I can only echo what has already been said. It also seems to me to be a point in need of a little adjustment. However, this process is not so straightforward: tomorrow there will be further amendments proposed. Let us see what the result of that is. Jürgen Klute,

Madam President, first of all, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. I think that overall, the report establishes a good position for this House in this heated debate between Parliament and the Council. From my Group’s perspective, I would point out, first and foremost, that austerity policies in recent years have obviously failed and that countries which have run such policies and are under pressure to make savings have seen a loss of growth and tax revenue but also an increase in poverty and unemployment. Cuts in the MFF would mean the continuation and entrenchment of these policies for the next seven years, as a substantial proportion of the EU budget goes back to the Member States where it is used to support economic development, research and education. For that reason, we cannot and will not vote for such cuts in the MFF. Let me take an example from history. My country, the Federal Republic of Germany, faced a similar deep-seated crisis after the Second World War. Then in 1953, the London debt agreement was adopted, which not only cancelled Germany’s debts; it also, and above all, aimed to provide clear and tangible impetus for economic growth through programmes initiated under the Marshall Plan. This helped to bring Germany out of its post-war indebtedness and paved the way for its economy to develop in the way that it has. So our view is that we cannot make cuts: we must expand the budget and develop it further, and thus ensure that growth can help us overcome this crisis. I fully support Helga Trüpel’s detailed comments about own resources and the Financial Transaction Tax. We support this position too and would welcome rather more commitment from Parliament to moving forward on the question of own resources and implementation of the Financial Transaction Tax, as this is an important issue for this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Commissioner, I basically welcome your initiative for common banking supervision in Europe. I believe that is necessary. I have a couple of questions, however. The European landscape, the EU, is dotted with a wide variety of banks: savings banks, cooperative banks, private banks, big banks. I believe that we must maintain and protect this variety, even with European supervision. I believe this is very important because many of the small banks were stable throughout the crisis and should not be sent to the wall. Secondly, I would like to say that I do not believe that supervision alone will be enough. The supervisory body must also have effective instruments to enable it to intervene in the market as necessary, even removing toxic products from the market as required. Thirdly, and lastly, however good a bank supervisory body may be, it can still do little, with the legal situation as it currently is, with regard to the shadow bank sector. This means that we still need to remain aware of the fact that only part of the problem will be resolved with such bank supervision. The problem of the shadow banks will remain. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, on our agenda this week is a legislative own-initiative report on the subject of access to basic banking services. Parliament makes clear and detailed proposals from its perspective about what the Commission’s legislative initiative could and should look like. The first specific proposal concerns the schedule. A very large majority of the members of the main committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, believes that we should not waste any more time unnecessarily on this subject. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament by January 2013. I think that we are working along the same lines as Mr Barnier. We are of the opinion that the EU must make it possible for the 30 million citizens who have not yet had a bank account of their own to become part of the normal financial system. Without a bank account, things which the rest of us take for granted soon become insoluble problems. Renting a flat, signing a contract with an electricity supplier or joining the modern world of work are almost impossible in most countries unless you have a bank account. We believe that all of this should not be allowed to fail simply because the banks are aiming to maximise their profits. To quote the report: banks also have a responsibility for society. We will only have a functioning social market economy and a modern internal market when the banks genuinely take on this responsibility. However, let us be honest about the situation. Many citizens no longer trust the EU to achieve these goals. When it comes to the crunch, as it has in the current crisis, for the majority of citizens, these are just empty words. They know that the EU is supporting the banks with large rescue packages and many of them feel as if they have been left out in the cold. At least that is the impression that more and more citizens of more and more countries in the European Union have. The report which we will be voting on tomorrow was not originally planned as an own-initiative report. If the majority of the Commissioners had stuck to the Commission’s plan, today we would be able to present the citizens with the results of the negotiations. Work could already have begun on establishing the right of consumers throughout Europe to an account or these accounts could even be a reality already. We regard the recommendation that the Commission has sent to the Member States as disappointing. Many of the responses from the Member States to the request and to the Commission’s country reports are more akin to satire than to a sensible policy which is relevant to the citizens. In order to understand this, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. The question of access to bank accounts involves business interests, which is quite normal. These are interests which could hardly be more different as far as their opportunities for influence are concerned. Therefore, politicians must be responsible for ensuring a fair and socially desirable balance of interests. That is our job as politicians and as Members of Parliament. I cannot cover all the aspects of the report here. I simply want to highlight briefly what I believe are a few key points. One of these is cost. A basic account should be provided free of charge or at least at a reasonable charge. This is what the report says. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Member States should set a mandatory upper limit. The Commission should also investigate the possibility of an EU-wide upper limit for charges on a basic account, because we will not reach our target group without clear regulations on costs. Access is another important point. We must keep the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum for consumers who rely on a basic account. Financial exclusion goes hand in hand with social exclusion. Another key point is subsidiarity. A directive would enable us to take the individual features of each country into account. We believe that the Member States would be best placed to define potential exceptions if as many of the banks as possible were covered by the directive. Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the members of the negotiating team, to the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also to Mr Barnier for our very effective and constructive collaboration. This definitely made a major contribution to the success of the report. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like once again to thank everyone very much for supporting this report. This has been made very clear. Mr Barnier, you have heard that this initiative has broad support here in Parliament. I believe it is now time for the Commission to take action. We all know that you are very committed. No one doubts your commitment. However, we also know that there is opposition to this within the Commission. Please tell the College of Commissioners what you have heard here. You can be sure that you will have our broad support on this matter. It is true that there are one or two detailed issues that still need discussing, but I feel that we were able to work together very constructively across all the groups in the compromise negotiations. I am sure that we will find solutions for the specific issues which everyone will be happy with. Finally, I would like to say that I am looking forward to continuing to work together with everyone on this subject. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2010, the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States finally acknowledged that the European Community needs a more closely coordinated financial and economic policy. At the summit, they ‘invented’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed. An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy. It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘mini jobs’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight. I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea behind the ‘two-pack’ is to provide further rights of intervention in respect of crisis countries in the euro area. The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission’s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘six-pack’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday. Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘two-pack’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès’s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option. It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax is certainly not identical to the Tobin tax that has been talked about and debated for many years, but I think it incorporates essential elements of the Tobin tax. It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis. I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets. However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate. There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level. I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success. While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here. I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions. I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here. It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.

Well, in so doing, we are merely picking up on the tax that the City of London takes on derivatives, and even if we do not consider the tax rate to be sufficient, then that by no means suggests that we do not think this project is a good one. I see no contradiction there, and it would add something into the bargain if it corresponded to what has long been the practice in the City of London. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

– This FTT plan picks up on a number of elements of the Tobin tax which has been under discussion for many years now. It is an important signal to send to citizens, markets and banks following a series of campaigns and petitions aimed at introducing an FTT at EU level. Obviously, it could have gone further. It is not sufficient to stabilise financial markets and more needs to be done, but I urge the Council to follow the citizens and do everything possible to prevent this proposal from being blocked by Member States.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that in my opinion the sections in Ms Oomen-Ruijten’s report concerning the judiciary and constitutional reform are highly successful. I would like to congratulate her on these sections. However, I also believe that far too little attention has been paid to the subject of the situation of the Kurds in Turkey. As has been said several times, there are not only hundreds of journalists in prison, but also thousands of Kurds and in particular Kurdish politicians who are members of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). Some of them are elected members of parliament. This is not the way to resolve the conflict between the Turkish Government and the Kurds. It would be good to make our position on this subject clearer in the report. Together with some other Members, we have tabled amendments for tomorrow. I will be very pleased if there is majority support for these amendments. In my opinion, it will not help if we close our eyes to what is happening at this point. The EU must make itself clearly heard with regard to this issue. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what will the citizens of Europe think of the way in which we are handling the crisis after the last summit? They will realise that the banks are receiving around EUR 1 trillion from the European Central Bank (ECB) without any conditions being imposed on them. No strings are attached to this money and the banks can use it for whatever purpose they want. In contrast, the countries that are in crisis are being gagged and forced to introduce disastrous austerity measures. The citizens of the crisis countries are having to put up with cuts in their pay, pensions and social security benefits. However, unlike Germany, the economies of these crisis countries are not dependent on exports, but on their own internal markets. It is precisely these markets which are being destroyed by the austerity policies that have been imposed. This is not the right way to get out of the crisis, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy. In political terms, the EU is being driven into a brick wall. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would like to start with the positive aspects. I would like to emphasise that we welcome what Mr La Via’s report says on the subject of growth, which is that the focus must be on growth. We need growth that creates jobs and that can help combat youth unemployment. We think that this is very important. I would like to highlight the fact that we welcome the points relating to research and investment in research. However, I think we need clearer statements on fighting poverty within Europe and also in the world as a whole, on a global level. Moreover, the report did not look at how we are to combat climate change. I am very critical of the opening section of the report, which concerns automatic sanctions. I think that threatening the Member States with automatic sanctions is a mistake, given that they are already in a difficult situation with regard to their budgets. We are opposed to this. However, I want to highlight one point which I think is very sensible and that is increased coordination of the budgets of the Member States and the EU using a process which has democratic legitimacy. I would like to make one final remark on the subject of cutbacks. I want to emphasise that we do not believe that budget cuts are appropriate. We have already made it clear that Croatia will be joining the EU during the course of the year. We will have a whole series of new jobs to do in the EU and we have had new supervisory bodies in place now for more than a year. We need these bodies and we need funding and staff for them, so that they can work effectively and prevent future crises. This will ensure that the expenditure is a sensible investment which will help us to save money in future. In my opinion, these are the crucial points. Most importantly, we hope that we can work to ensure that there are no budget cuts. For us, that is essential. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday. The detailed regulations are also now available. What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified? Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem. A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however. I would say to the Commission that ‘cheap’ is not the same thing as ‘good’. It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners. Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story. I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed. That is nonsense. In the face of increasing world trade, Europe’s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink. Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade. We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level. In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly. Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions. However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources. As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear. A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries. Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States. The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU. Yet what does the Council do in this situation? It curtails the Commission’s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed. If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council.

 Madam President, Mr Šemeta, I would like to make a few comments on the tax agreement between Germany and Switzerland, as other speakers have done. Instead of stopping tax evasion and blocking the loopholes for tax evaders, which would have been sensible, the result that has been produced here is a Swiss cheese full of large holes. The proposed transition period of five months gives tax evaders plenty of time to transfer their money from Switzerland to other tax havens. As foundations and trusts are not governed by the agreement, it is also possible to transform assets which have been stashed away in Switzerland into the assets of a foundation. Forms for doing this can be obtained from Swiss banks. Tax investigators in Germany have recently received information about a number of tax evaders who have hidden their assets away in Switzerland. The agreement gives these people an amnesty and the tax investigators can no longer use the information that has been made available to them. What sort of agreement is it that restricts the activities of tax investigators? An advertising video produced by Swiss banks says about this agreement that customers will benefit even more in future from the values of Switzerland as a financial centre. The agreement obviously not only lacks the necessary coordination at EU level, but also counteracts the efforts of the EU to bring more transparency into tax issues, to make the collection of tax in the Member States more efficient and, above all, to combat and to prevent tax fraud. Therefore, this agreement is, in our view, not acceptable. We are calling on the EU to oppose it, if there is any doubt. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Commissioner, for your answer which sounds very positive. However, I would like to emphasise once again that the problem lies in the fact that there was already a human rights clause in the old preferences scheme and it did not help to prevent the violations of human rights which took place under the Uribe government and before that. Therefore, my question was specifically: What exactly will be different? How do the EU and the Commission intend to guarantee in future that these violations of human rights will not be repeated? On the other hand, I have figures which show that under the new government in the last 300 days there have been more than 200 attacks on human rights activists. Also 15 leaders who supported human rights and the fair distribution of land in the agricultural sector have been murdered. When I look at what is happening, I have to ask once again: How exactly are you going to ensure that you can prevent this? I still do not know what the answer to this question is. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Goebbels has just set out very clearly the role that derivatives played in the financial crisis and what scale they possess. In view of this enormous scale, many citizens are calling for such financial products to be taken off the market altogether. We called for that too. However, we realise that such a small political group as ours has no chance of achieving a majority for this. We have to accept that, and we do. Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise once again that we thought it would be sensible to go further in this regard. On the other hand – and I say this to Mr Langen clearly and with respect – in our view the resulting report is acceptable and fair. Three important points from our perspective are the clearing obligation, the authorisation and monitoring of central counterparties and the reporting requirement for derivatives traders. These seem to us to provide an important and capable basic framework and a sound infrastructure that will enable us to arrive at a rational regulation. Moreover, this regulation is essential if we are to be able to levy a financial transaction tax – which is currently a subject of debate – on derivatives transactions. Although we have not succeeded in asserting all our demands, we believe that this report is absolutely worthy of our support. I would like to mention one more point that I considered to be particularly important: the reference to the problem of trading in food commodities and the associated speculation. We were only able to include this reference in the recitals; Mr Langen was prepared to do this. This point will come up again as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) progresses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 – (DE)
 Mr President, our party has already given this matter some consideration, but I do not have enough time to go into things to any degree right now. We do have some ideas for different ways of working with the financial markets, and how the things that derivatives are used for can, to some extent, be achieved by other means. It would take too long to explain all this at this juncture. However, I should be happy to provide you with more information in this connection. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session. Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple. The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated. As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these. The necessary translations were not available, either. We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009. However, the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table. For us, economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries. For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market. Naturally, for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets. None of this is to be found in the economic governance package. Instead, the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe. As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole. This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece, of Portugal and of Spain, but also those of northern European countries, back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe. The much-needed improvements on the Commission’s original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there – particularly in Mrs Ferreira’s report – have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council. In our view, the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable. As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with. This is reserved for the Commission. It bears little resemblance to democracy, and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future. In our view, the economic governance package – at least in its present form – is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing. That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not so much about individual people; it is, first and foremost, about a selection process. Surprisingly, anyone who searches for information on the selection process for the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Internet will essentially only discover that the United States and Europe share the two leading positions. That means that the economically strongest nations, as a minority, share control of the global economy among themselves, so to speak. That is feudalism and has nothing to do with democracy, and that is why we cannot accept this. In our view, Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepping down presents a major opportunity to make fundamental changes at this point to the nomination and selection process and to make it an open, transparent and, above all, merit- and qualification-based selection process, as some NGOs have been calling for recently. This should also include a combination of majority votes from the members of the IMF and a majority of voting shares in the IMF. Up to now, only the voting shares in the IMF have been taken into account, which ensures a structural majority for the economically strong nations. This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF. In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the core task of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is to promote the EU’s objectives through long-term financing of viable investments. This also means that the EIB is bound by the EU’s values; in other words, by social standards, transparency, high environmental standards, the development of a sustainable economy and the creation of jobs. However, we are hearing from NGOs involved in the local implementation of EIB-financed projects that it is by no means consistently ensured that these standards are met. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. The NGOs criticise the lack of transparency as regards the way in which loans are monitored across the EU and worldwide, how they are used and how they are reported on by the EIB’s financial intermediaries. To what extent is the EIB aware of these criticisms, and to what extent is the EIB actually looking into such criticisms? That is what we would like to know. From our point of view, at least some of what NGOs are calling for from the EIB is quite plausible: greater transparency as regards the granting of credit by financial intermediaries and the elaboration of clearer financing terms for financial intermediaries as well as efficiency criteria for the granting of loans. To improve transparency, NGOs further propose that environmental and financial information on EIB-financed projects be published before these are approved. In particular, EIB projects in third countries should be subjected to independent sustainability assessments in order to determine the economic, social and ecological impact of the project in question. However, there also appear to be other problems apart from transparency. Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental, social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs. Strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB’s financial operations. Projects that do not meet these standards should be excluded from support. Finally, I would like to make a comment on the subject of energy policy. It is pleasing that the promotion of a sustainable and safe energy supply is already one of the EIB’s current objectives. In view of the disaster involving the Fukushima reactor, the promotion of forward-looking, renewable, CO2
-free and nuclear-free energy production, as well as the promotion of energy efficiency in all areas in which the EIB invests, must be given the highest priority. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I think it is difficult to go into detail on this right now in view of the time available. However, I have a large number of reports from NGOs that I am happy to make available. I believe that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also familiar with these. These reports talk of how development aid is supported locally by the EIB in African and Asian countries and also make some criticisms of this. I am happy to make the reports available, but I cannot answer the question in detail right now. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the call for a financial transaction tax is nothing new; opponents of globalisation have been calling for such a tax for some years. Just five years ago, however, hardly anyone would have thought that it might be possible to implement it in the foreseeable future. Yet this week, it is on the agenda of the European Parliament alongside a CO2
 tax and Eurobonds, and rightly so in my opinion. I can only welcome and support the financial instruments proposed by Mrs Podimata in her report, and I believe they will be voted through. These instruments are urgently needed. So far, the consolidation of national budgets has concentrated solely on cuts in expenditure. However, cuts in public spending primarily impact workers, pensioners and the poor; in other words, those reliant on the welfare state. The income side of public financing has been completely disregarded to date. It is the second lever that we can use to consolidate national budgets. In particular, addressing the income side would result in the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis shouldering an appropriate part of the public debt. If we are to consolidate national budgets, then it is quite simply imperative that we increase tax revenues. In fact, the high level of public debt is mainly a result of the nationalisation of private debt; in other words, of governments taking on the debts of private banks and financing the consequences of the financial crisis. The states are thus in no way solely responsible for the debt crisis. Asking the financial sector to dip into its own pockets is therefore not simply obvious; it is our political duty. A financial transaction tax would at last mean this sector shouldering part of this debt as one of the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis. This report would send out an important political signal were it to be adopted as presented. Similarly, we consider Eurobonds to be a sensible and, thus, also a necessary instrument. They will do more to reduce debt than all the sanctions and advice put together, however well meant. The complaints by some countries in surplus that Eurobonds would increase their interest burden are unacceptable since, at the same time, these countries in surplus are earning more from their exports to deficit countries. Some might criticise this as a transfer union. However, anyone who wants a social Europe – who wants the EU to continue to hold together in the future – must accept the idea of a transfer union at least in principle. Finally, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope that it will now finally present proposals for a financial transaction tax; we have been calling for this for over a year now.

 Support for small and medium-sized enterprises will safeguard numerous jobs and strengthen the innovation potential of the European economy. It is therefore absolutely right to ensure the reasonable provision of loan capital for these enterprises, as only then can they make the necessary investments. However, the increase in venture capital called for by the European Parliament is to be rejected on principle. Instead of placing banks under an obligation to support the real economy by providing appropriate credit, Parliament is calling for it to be easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to get contributions from investment funds and private equity firms on the capital markets. With a motto of ‘locusts for everyone’, the motion for a resolution calls in places for private equity firms to make it easier to do business with them. This would turn smaller enterprises in particular into the pawns of investors to an even greater extent than they are now. These investors are very often on the look-out for absurdly high two-figure profits, which they can usually only achieve by carving up the acquired enterprises and selling them off bit by bit.

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do. There is therefore an urgent need for action. I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA. That is an important and positive step in the right direction. However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report. I would like to mention this once again. Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change. The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency. The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about. Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products. This, too, has come to nothing. I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier. Jürgen Klute,

Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation. I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience. Many people thought – and I would like to underline this fact again here – that the crisis in the euro area was over. Ireland shows that this is not the case. Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets. The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages. At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us. This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland – the star pupil – that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system – a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation. In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama. It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach. While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty. Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB. Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel’s simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet. If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air. Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I admit that that is difficult to assess. I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now.

 Mr President, I would like to make two comments. The first is addressed to Mr Gauzès. I would like to thank him specifically for his excellent work and cooperation. However, I also found the cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs to be exceptionally good and constructive. I wanted to say that right at the start before I come to my points of criticism. I can, in principle, accept and reinforce what Mr Giegold has just said. I could have supported the first compromise that we agreed on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in May of this year. Indeed, I was able to go along with the decision. However, what has now been produced as a result of further negotiations is, also in the opinion of my group, no longer acceptable and we can no longer support it. As I see it, everyone is entitled to his own opinion on the matter, but in my view, the Council has played an unfortunate role here. I will express this a bit clearer than one or two others have done. In my view, the Council has missed an opportunity here. It gave in to a considerable extent to the financial market lobby and used everything in its power to prevent an effective regulation at European level. One morning, I received a call from a lobbyist, who said that if we really wanted to regulate private equities in this way, we would prevent development aid getting to Africa. A more absurd and obscure argument could not be found in this regard. These things have nothing to do with one another. Anyone who comes up with this sort of argument merely demonstrates the fact that he has no interest in meaningful and effective regulation. However, this is not the concern of Parliament. On behalf of Parliament – and I would like to emphasise this once again – Mr Gauzès and other fellow Members fought for an effective regulation. That was undermined by the Council. I want to say this once again; this is passive marketing. This is a point that Mr Giegold has already mentioned. It is like someone being prohibited from selling rotten eggs at the weekly market if he advertises them, but if he does not advertise the rotten eggs and just stands there and sells them, then it is evidently legitimate. However, it is no different to what has been laid down here in the section relating to passive marketing. It provides an opening. We have a European regulation – that has already been said and I think it is a good thing. However, when the door is wide open for it to be circumvented through loopholes, then the question arises as to how effective this European regulation really is. Private equities were originally regulated better. They are now relatively weakly regulated. A very important point – and here, too, I can only reinforce what Mr Giegold said – is the question of the information provided to the workforce. The original compromise stated that managers were obliged to inform their workforce of what they intended to do with the companies in which they had invested. What remains of this is the strained requirement for owners to inform their workforce and the works councils. You can imagine what will come of this – not very much. The Council has missed an opportunity here, and I hope that we will perhaps still be able to improve on it at a later date. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, economic governance as it is being developed here focuses solely on savings and competition policy. As has just been mentioned by the honourable Member from Spain, the problem of Germany’s orientation towards exports has not been addressed at all. Yet this is clearly a central problem, both in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole. German competition policy is being conducted to the detriment of internal demand in Germany. This is not being discussed at all. Above all, however, it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages. It is a wage battle – a wage competition. This wage competition is exerting enormous pressure on our neighbouring European countries, on European trade unions and on European workers. Neither the Commission nor the Feio report have addressed this problem. Any economic governance worthy of the name must take corrective action in this area rather than remaining silent. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank my fellow Members who have participated in rather tough and lengthy negotiations here. It is a tremendous achievement by the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs to have managed to do what they have done. They achieved the best result that it was possible to negotiate. Nevertheless, I do not want to hold back on the criticism that my group has, either. There are three points in particular that we are not happy about. On the one hand, the competences that have been granted to the supervisory authorities are, in our view, inadequate. We would have liked these competences to have been more extensive. We believe it is also wrong for the supervisory authorities to be split over several locations. We advocated combining them as far as possible in one location. That would certainly have made cooperation easier and more efficient. Mr Giegold has already mentioned that the staffing could, and should in fact, be improved in the long term. These are our main points of criticism. Nevertheless, we believe this to be a right and important step in the right direction, a right and important step towards a new regulation of the financial markets that is urgently needed. However – and this is simply our assessment – we still need to take some further steps in order to arrive at a truly effective new regulation of the financial markets, to get to a point where, through European regulations, we can prevent another crisis like the one we have just experienced. Our group will contribute greatly to this. There are, of course, a few more legislative initiatives on the way. We hope that these will bring more substance to this matter. If so, something truly effective and good could come of this. However, we really do still have a few more steps to take in this regard. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would just like to remind you that the rating agency Moody downgraded Greece again last night. We all know that the Greek Government has placed enormous pressure on its people in recent weeks, in order to get the crisis under control. We all know that the European Union has put together a package worth EUR 750 billion in order to support the countries that have found themselves in crisis and to help them out of it. Nevertheless, Greece has been downgraded. In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package. Mr Barnier, you have just used the metaphor of a thermometer and said that it must not be broken. I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies. A thermometer obviously does nothing to help improve the condition of the clients, the patient in question – which is something it just cannot do. After all, the thermometer is no drug and is obviously making the patient’s condition even worse. However, it is unacceptable that the countries which are making these efforts should end up being downgraded even further, despite everything they have done. This raises the question about what these rating agencies actually do. It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming. Therefore, rating agencies did not help predict or diagnose the crisis. Shortly before it collapsed, Lehman Brothers received quite a positive rating. So, with the methods they used, they were not able or did not want to recognise what we had in store. In that respect, this instrument has been a total failure. Nor have they helped us manage the crisis. I have just given you a newspaper quote on that: ‘Ratings have not helped improve the crisis situation despite all the efforts made and there is concern’ – as the media put it – ‘that we will not be able to see through the packages we have put together’. This means they will pull us down and downgrade us even further. To conclude, I would like to point out that countries and companies are just not comparable. We have to take a closer look at these ratings. Just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough. What we need is a root-and-branch reform of rating systems. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of this opportunity to take another look at the situation in Greece, because I believe that the crisis in Greece gives us an insight into the political status of the euro area. Firstly, however, I would like to make a remark about the calls from the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, to exclude Greece from the euro area, if necessary. My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, believes that this proposal is absolutely absurd. On the one hand, we are talking about a community with a common destiny. If we mean this seriously, then we cannot call, on the other hand, for a Member State to be excluded during the first large or moderate crisis that we have encountered. That is preposterous! Most importantly, this would be an admission of failure which would amount to kowtowing to the financial sector. The financial sector has shamelessly allowed itself to be bought out of the crisis by taxpayers, but we are now being asked to deny help of this kind to Greece. It will be difficult to explain to the pensioners and the workers in Greece and also in the other countries affected – according to the media, Portugal is the next country to come under scrutiny – why they are now being asked to pay up, having already supported the banks with their taxes. Taking this route would be the equivalent of driving the EU project into a wall. Despite all the justified criticism of Greece – and the Greek Members will realise that there is much to be done in their country – the crisis is by no means solely the responsibility of Greece. I would just like to point out that the majority of decisions on financial policy in the euro area have been handed over to the European Central Bank. The euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies. Major exporters such as Germany are forcing Greek economic policy to its knees. Therefore, this also represents a crisis in EU economic and competition policy. This is why we are calling for the ban on financial assistance for EU Member States to be lifted. The Member States in the euro area should make euro loans available, the European Central Bank should buy up debts in the same way that the Federal Service in the USA has done and credit default swaps should be banned. This is what we are calling for. (The President cut off the speaker) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to comment on two aspects of the Turkish issue. It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed, and rightly so. There is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain. However, what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in Turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights. The Turkish Government continues to oppose trade unions – in some circumstances even using the power of the police – which provide support for their members, in other words, for Turkish working people. This has happened recently in the dispute involving the Tekel workers. That is one of the comments that I would like to make. A democratic society must protect the rights of employees and trade unions and it is important to fight for these rights. The EU also supports these rights, in particular, in its role as a social European Union. The second factor is privatisation. Turkey is adapting to the EU and this includes the area of privatisation. The Tekel employees, of whom 12 000 are currently on strike, are threatened with the loss of their jobs or have already lost them as a result of privatisation. However, it is not only the Tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry. Around 500 000 people employed in growing tobacco in south-eastern Turkey have lost their jobs in recent years, with the result that, having been one of the major producers and exporters of tobacco, Turkey has now become an importer. A week ago, I had the chance to go to Ankara and speak with the Tekel employees. If the process of cutting jobs and destroying whole sectors of industry continues as a result of privatisation, the people of Turkey will lose their enthusiasm for accession to the EU. Therefore, we must put the focus on the social aspect of the EU. I would like to emphasise that once again. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years. Since the ban – we have only just heard about this – more than a thousand people have been arrested. I think that, in a country in which parties are routinely banned, it is no longer possible to talk of democracy. The prohibition of 27 Kurdish parties almost constitutes an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of Records. It is not only about the minorities in Turkey – and this is something that I would also like to mention again at this point. There is currently a strike being held by tobacco workers at the firm Tekel that is very intense and is now escalating. Several thousand workers went on hunger strike today in order to enforce their rights. They feel they have been severely oppressed by the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities. This aspect must be taken into account, because the protection of the rights of workers and trade unions is an integral part of democracy. The trade unions, but also the minorities, in Turkey are awaiting a clear and unambiguous opinion from this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the previous speakers. I would like to remind everyone that the Colombian President also attempted to extend his term of office in breach of current Colombian law and, therefore, this matter should also be taken up. Most importantly, however, I would like to highlight the fact that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation in Germany, a foundation which has close links with the German Free Democratic Party, was involved in the coup in Honduras. There was a debate about this at least in Germany. The foundation’s scholarship holders distanced themselves from this policy in an open letter. We must not forget that Mr van Baalen is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Friedrich-Naumann foundation, it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua. I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances – and this has not been contradicted – a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind. In all honesty, we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe. What is happening here is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discredit and publicly shame those countries, states and governments in Latin America which are trying to introduce more social policies. On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to say clearly once again that we will not support this. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament’s agenda many times. It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. That has been said a couple of times already. Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament. In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU. On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request. It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail. As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests. Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered? If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered? My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests? Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the world economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves cannot yet be foreseen. We have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force. What does the European Union do in this situation, where more and more people are threatened by poverty and unemployment and fear for their existence? The European Union decides on new focal areas in its budget. Or, to be more precise, it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders, in favour of hi-tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe’s citizens. Believe it or not, there is to be an increase of 16% for the area of freedom, security and justice. The fund to secure the external borders is to receive 12% more funding next year. The expenditure on strategic military security research is being almost doubled and will now rise to a total of EUR 215 million. From the point of view of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, this means that the EU is taking leave of its founding idea of being a peace project for Europe. This draft budget instead follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, with its obligation on the part of the Member States to constantly modernise their military apparatus and to secure the external borders. Europe’s Left instead demands that the European Union implement a consistent peace policy. Instead of an agency for armament, we call for a disarmament agency. Europe must concentrate its resources on civilian conflict resolution strategies such as a Europe-wide civilian peace corps and promoting independent research into peace and conflicts. In our view, this budget sets our sights increasingly on war instead of on crisis management and the Left in the European Parliament will not, therefore, support this budget. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council spring summit is traditionally devoted to discussing the economic and employment policies of the European Union, more recently in connection with the so-called European Semester. This year, however, the debate is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic situation in Greece. Greece is the ideal example on which to base a discussion about the failure of the economic and financial policies of the European Union. The predominant global policy of deregulation and privatisation has plunged the European Union into the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. As a result of this policy of deregulation, the global financial markets and also the commodity markets have got completely out of control or, more accurately, have fallen victim to speculators. The Greek crisis is also a result of EU policy, because the existing macro-economic imbalances between the Member States will be significantly exacerbated by the Europe 2020 strategy. These imbalances are what the financial speculators are now gambling on. It is not only Greece which is fighting for survival. A policy which has had such disastrous consequences in Greece and in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, needs fundamental changes. In fact, it must be reversed. Austerity measures are making the economic recession worse, as the fall in the gross domestic product figures of these countries has shown so dramatically. My group was strongly opposed to the Europe 2020 strategy and the imposition of one-sided austerity and debt reduction policies right from the outset. Instead, we need programmes to stimulate sustainable growth and to create jobs, together with programmes for investment, for the environment and for education. A policy which involves axing social services, abolishing social legislation and restricting fundamental democratic and parliamentary rights, while at the same time supporting the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, can only lead to outrage and social unrest. The Greek Government is losing its political base, the parties which belong to it are losing their members and the structure of society is collapsing. This is the result of Greek and European policy and it requires a fundamental change in the EU’s approach in favour of one which serves the interests of the people rather than those of the banks. One scenario could begin with the financial markets. Let us imagine that the European Central Bank (ECB) could lend money directly to the Member States via a public bank. This would enable the Member States to circumvent the international financial markets and to obtain the loans they need at favourable interest rates. No one could gamble on Greek, Portuguese or other bonds. All of the hype surrounding the markets would disappear. Does that sound appealing? All we need is the determination to take this step, and this is what my group is calling for. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the financial markets has led to developments on the markets that have not yet been brought under control. Only radical measures to prevent speculation on the markets will be able to put a definitive stop to the crisis. Instead of this, with the adoption of the Fiscal Compact Treaty we are seeing a further increase in the one-sided focus on austerity policy and the destruction of social cohesion. My group is strongly opposed to this radical approach of debt reduction and cuts in public budgets. It has even been criticised by the International Monetary Fund. The financial guru George Soros says that this austerity policy has thrown Europe into a deflationary spiral of debt. The debt brake was laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht and its adoption in national law is now intended to force its implementation. If that does not happen, the Member States are to be penalised with the help of the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union. That is absurd, and it is also undemocratic, as the Member States will lose their most important right: their budgetary sovereignty. Furthermore, it is totally unacceptable for the aid that is used to show solidarity with Member States which are in difficulty to be made conditional on signing up to the Fiscal Compact Treaty. This sacrifices the most important fundamental principle of the European Union on the altar of the financial markets. The Left will work to bring about a reversal of this disastrous policy. We need a pact for sustainable growth and employment. We need public programmes for investment in the environment and education and, above all, we need the European Parliament and the citizens to have a say. The Treaty must be approved by referendum or by public consultation. (Applause) Lothar Bisky  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, on October 30, our colleague Mr Meyer, a member of my group, was forcibly prevented from leaving the airport in the city of El-Aaiún in Western Sahara, receiving injuries from Moroccan security forces. The doctor diagnosed various contusions, problems with the neck muscles and dangerously high blood pressure as a consequence of the violence. This attack on a Member of the European Parliament is completely unacceptable. The President, the offices of the European Parliament and the national authorities have made representations to the Moroccan Government. So far there has been no response from Morocco. We cannot simply accept this without a word. I would ask for your solidarity. This outrageous incident is an opportunity for me to remind us all, yet again, that the people of Western Sahara have been suffering for decades as a result of the inability of politicians to bring about a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict. I believe that we can no longer remain silent. We should focus more on this issue in the second half of this electoral term. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the EU summit was supposed to bring about a breakthrough in the process of resolving the international financial crisis. It has undoubtedly not succeeded in doing so, because too many issues have been ignored and there has been a one-sided focus on reducing public debt and budgetary supervision. Even much of this was very unspecific. It may have given us a breathing space, but nothing more. The much-talked-about confidence of the markets cannot be regained by imposing an austerity policy based on the German model. The causes of the financial crisis are varied in nature, but the failure of independent bodies and, most importantly, the political system to manage or monitor the unregulated financial markets is the decisive factor. If we apply this standard, it is clear that the leading politicians of the 27 EU Member States once again did not want or were unable to take action. Increasing the financial power of the instruments which are intended to prevent speculation by bringing forward by one year the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) that amounts to EUR 500 billion, by continuing in parallel with the European Financial Stability Facility, and by extending the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with EUR 200 billion, will only guarantee that the banks will have their loans repaid and make a healthy profit on the interest. This is how the governments of the euro countries want to play the game with the financial markets, but they forget that they are in the weaker position. Most importantly, the failed attempt to leverage the rescue funds demonstrates the power and the powerlessness of the policy. The main opponent within the EU of regulating the international financial markets has gone into self-imposed isolation. Hopefully, decisive action will now be taken to tackle this problem, at least within the euro area and the EU Member States which want to join the euro. The first step must be to implement the international transaction tax quickly. Next, the most dangerous new financial products must simply be banned. This also applies to the activities of the shadow banks. The European Union can and must make progress and set an example in this area. If EU banks try to evade regulation in other parts of the world, they will be threatened with the removal of state rescue packages in the case of a crisis. Their business can ultimately be placed under state supervision or they can be nationalised. This would be an appropriate response to a systemic crisis. The consequences of the international crisis, which has been going on since 2008, are already unbearable for the vast majority of citizens. Young people’s plans for the future, provisions for the working population and the life’s work of millions of people have already been destroyed, with the most serious impact being felt, of course, in the crisis countries of Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. However, the citizens of all EU countries are affected by the excessive austerity measures. They are the culmination of the neoliberal policy of deregulation and privatisation and the redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top. This policy over the last 15 years is what has taken us into the crisis and, therefore, it must be stopped and reversed. We can only ensure that public interests are served and that the welfare state is maintained by restraining blind market forces. Austerity measures will not stimulate growth and will not lead us out of the crisis. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, the crisis merry-go-round is turning faster and faster and more and more euro countries are being pulled aboard. Even the countries with the best triple A ratings, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, are feeling the adverse effects caused by the financial markets, which are playing cat and mouse with the euro countries. All the measures that we have adopted so far to regulate them have had hardly any effect. We can therefore legitimately ask whether it is time to change the rules of the game. However, the decision on this needs to be made by the EU institutions and not by means of intergovernmental agreements, such as those envisaged by Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy. The vicious circle of downgrades to countries’ ratings and rising interest rates has to be stopped. Therefore, we are making a decisive call for the evaluation of sovereign states by private rating agencies to be qualified and for the creation of an independent European agency. In addition, the European Central Bank must be allowed to buy bonds without restrictions. Ms Merkel seems to be ready to exchange her resistance to this for closer supervision of the budgets of individual countries and automatic sanctions. However, this involves allowing intervention in the sovereignty rights of individual states, in this case budgetary rights, which means that the inherent rights of national parliaments will be disregarded. In future, the Commission aims to be able to force countries to make social security cuts, lengthen working hours and increase the retirement age. I can only warn against implementing this policy. The results in Germany show that it puts a very one-sided burden on the majority of the population. Consequently, the social divide will become even wider. The low-wage sector now covers 20% of all working people. More and more people are finding themselves living in poverty in their old age. By contrast, a few rich people are becoming even wealthier. As a result of this policy, social equality is no longer functioning and society is threatened with collapse. I am opposed to a future of this kind for the European Union. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, as the example of Italy shows, where risk premiums for government bonds exceeded the critical mark of 7% for a while, the markets are relatively unimpressed by the decisions of the most recent European summit. The next euro area country is already in their sights. The increase in rates in Italy since October is not based on any trends in the real economy, and as the experiences of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain in similar situations show, concentrated remedial measures from the EU and the IMF and the use of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) appear inescapable. That clearly shows that the measures we have adopted so far to regulate the financial markets do not fully take effect. I fear that, even with the new plans to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area, this will not significantly change. When I think of the package of European Commission measures that you have announced, President Barroso, with the five proposals for increased economic policy coordination, I cannot see the answer to the main question, namely do you have the courage and the ability to regulate the players on the international financial markets in such a way that, in future, speculative activity could be excluded as far as possible? Ecofin’s discussions on the financial transaction tax demonstrate that there is no political will in the Member States even for small steps. The finance ministers continue to answer global challenges with national thinking and proposed solutions based on the interests of their national banks. How big does this crisis have to get, how many countries need to be mired in it, and how big must the sacrifices of the populaces of the countries affected be before people see that we need to act? You propose, for example, issuing a Green Paper on Euro Stability Bonds. Much as I stress the necessity to introduce Eurobonds, I am astounded by the method. How long do you want to spend talking about the necessary minutiae of the shape to be taken by the mechanism? What effect will the time spent on the discussion process have on the markets? For me, these are the crucial questions. Instead, the monitoring of the budgets of individual countries is to be tightened up again. It is as if you believed that forcing austerity measures would trigger growth. In reality, however, the most pressing issue is the need for specific measures to improve growth and employment, with the resultant income and thus domestic demand. The austerity measures put in place in the crisis only serve to deepen it. The key economic figures for Greece, Portugal and Ireland for 2010 and 2011 surely show this. There is one question that, it seems to me, has not been given sufficient consideration, namely how can additional sources of finance be unlocked for these Member States? Their Government revenues need to be increased. Up to now, we have only heard proposals to cut social security payments, wages and pensions, or to increase VAT. The result of this is to stifle consumption by the mass of the population, and the fairness gap between the rich and the poor could become even larger. The citizens, too, can feel this. They do not see themselves as responsible for this crisis, and they are right. They are calling for social equality, including fair taxation. That is why there are mass protests in the Member States where austerity packages have been imposed. That is why there is political instability in the crisis countries, where numerous governments have already been swept aside. If the austerity course were to be made worse, the protests would also grow further. Where does that lead us? It strikes me that there is a complete lack of taxing the banks, the big corporations and the rich in the Member States. They could make a greater contribution to overcoming the crisis without difficulty. Tangible steps in this direction are required. That would give the citizens the feeling that the pain was being shared more fairly. However, that policy direction must also come from you, from the Commission, the Council, the Euro Group and other international institutions. It has been shown, after all, that the neoliberal mantra of tax cuts and reducing the regulation of market forces led to such terrible distortions that the entire global financial system is in jeopardy. A reorientation of thinking and approach is required here. We need a ban on short-term trading of credit default swaps, on short selling and of other high risk financial products. That is the order of the day. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were promised a bold move that would constitute a comprehensive solution to overcome the debt crisis. But what has the summit actually achieved? The Greek debt crisis has entered a new phase with the agreed haircut of 50%. This is something to be welcomed because it means that the country is freed from a significant part of its national debt. This is a positive outward signal and eases the situation for the Greek Government. This step does not mean a reversal in the downward spiral of the Greek economy, however. According to expert assessments, the country’s financial needs up to 2020 have already risen to EUR 250 billion. Likewise, this has not reduced the disastrous consequences for the people of Greece. In particular, the Greek banks need to survive the consequences of the haircut. They need extensive supports if they are to be rescued from ruin, otherwise it is not just the bond holders who will bear the cost, but also countless Greek citizens with their savings, pensions and other insurance cover. Much as I welcome the fact that the main culprits for the debt crisis are being called to greater account, this may be a risky move, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and for many ordinary savers. What assets will be levied by the banks? I believe that a socially just solution can more probably be achieved with nationalised banks, although a rescue or capitalisation of the banks should be made conditional on direct consultation or even more effective controls by the state. Banks in these countries should be recapitalised to the same extent as banks in France, Germany and other countries. The question remains whether the haircut will bring the much-vaunted lasting solution for Greece and the other endangered countries. Will this restore the trust of citizens and investors in the international financial markets? This is a question that I can only answer by quoting a famous phrase from Faust: ‘While I have heard the message– about the summit – I am not sure I believe it.’ When I think of the general strike and the further mobilisation of the public, I know that the Greek people have lost confidence massively. What is more, democracy itself is in huge danger, after all a government can only act against the opinion of the majority of the population for so long. This is a question that must also be answered by the IMF, ECB and the Council, in other words the so-called Troika, which has placed Greece under this austerity regime. My doubts also relate to the financial trick of leveraging the rescue fund. Although this will mobilise more financial resources, the question is at what cost? Countries are playing according to the rules of the financial markets and believe themselves to be in a strong position. If you will permit me, this is an illusion. The state debt crisis may not just spread very rapidly, but may also require massively increased commitments. This increases the risk to the taxpayer several fold. We must act decisively in bringing the power of the international financial community to heel, otherwise the crisis will spread. Everything is to play for. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of the crisis is becoming less and less transparent and more and more chaotic. The Council is starting to introduce pre-summits and main summits within the space of three days. Parliament is following the same rhythm and debating the results of the Council discussions twice during one part-session. It is already becoming clear that the big step forward that has been promised will not be happening on this occasion either. The only thing left to say is that the Council and the Commission are continuing to work on the principle of hope: hope that the new measures will generate sufficient confidence and that the investors on the international financial markets will be satisfied this time around. Why should they stop betting on future state bankruptcies? Why should they not try to draw Spain and Italy into the maelstrom of speculation? Only radical measures to prevent profitable speculation can stop this from happening. Until we bring in measures of this kind, the carousel will continue to turn and the Council will continue to propose rescue packages based on taxpayers’ money. The suggestion now is to use financial engineering tricks to leverage the agreed funding of EUR 87 billion for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). One German economist has referred in this context to a weapon of mass destruction, because the states which are showing signs of weakness require financing to the tune of EUR 4 trillion. The proposed haircut for Greece is inevitable. The only question is: who will bear the cost of it? Of course, it is right that the international banks should take on a greater share of up to 60%. However, it is important for us to prevent bankruptcies. This affects Greek banks in particular, whose very existence is under threat. After all the cuts in social security spending, do the Greek citizens now have to worry about the safety of their savings and bank deposits? Instead of a rescue package for the banks, we need a rescue package for wages, salaries, pensions and citizens’ savings. We need a public bank in the European Union which provides states with the necessary loans at favourable interest rates and excludes the private banks. We need public investment programmes to create jobs and employment. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, since the last debates on the state of the European Union here in Parliament, the situation has come to a head. I would like to say that none of the proposals have been taken up and implemented. I recognise that the situation has become rather critical. That is perhaps our problem. We are a long way from a comprehensive solution. It seems as if the players on the financial markets are just telling themselves that they do not need to take all this very seriously and that they will just carry on regardless – and they are carrying on regardless. They are cheerfully betting on the interest rates for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds, while the credit rating agencies, which are caught in a conflict of interests, are fanning the flames by reducing the credit rating of Spain and Italy. Greater attention is now turning to those European banks, whose undercapitalisation poses a growing risk, as demonstrated by the Dexia bank, for example. The people of Greece, Portugal and Spain are organising mass protests against the drastic measures to reduce public expenditure. Unemployment, the situation among young people and the austerity measures are mostly burdening citizens rather than those who have caused the crisis, namely, the players on the unregulated financial markets. In our Member States, there is an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions of Europe. This week, marchers from Spain, the indignados
, are here in Brussels. They want to give expression to their protest against the consequences of the policy of privatisation and liberalisation, which has led to the excesses of the markets. This movement of dissatisfied people encompasses all of those countries that are placing the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people. The clear failure of neoliberal policy affects not only the financial markets; it is clear here that speculating on rising and falling prices has long since reached other areas, for example, the global agricultural market and the commodities markets. The functioning of the real economy itself is at risk, because only a few large international companies can cope in a financially sensible way with the extreme fluctuations. Although we talk about it frequently, we have ended up in a hare and tortoise situation in which the market participants, representing the tortoise, proudly proclaim ‘I am already here’. I believe that if we want to take ourselves seriously, we need to ensure that we also discuss the follow-up to the debates. I would say that, in my opinion, nothing of any consequence has changed. If the sensible proposals that have been put forward here, including by Mr Barroso, cannot be put into practice, then the situation really is desperate. That is the crucial point of criticism that I would like to express. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Union is undergoing its most serious crisis since it was first founded. This is something that we definitely all agree on. It is, of course, all about the economic, financial and debt crisis, about Greece and about the euro. The Member States and the European Union have not put in place sufficiently effective regulation of the financial markets. As a result, the policy is likely to end up at the mercy of the speculators. The measures which have been taken so far are aimed at budgetary consolidation by means of cutting spending. In concrete terms this primarily means reducing social security budgets. It means cuts in salaries and benefits, rising unemployment, falling public investment and a drop in real economic growth. More and more decisions are being taken on an intergovernmental basis without prior agreement with parliaments, but instead in agreement with bank bosses. As a result, the European Union is increasingly losing confidence and support. The eurosceptics are gaining ground and that is a fact. The European Union is in the midst of a crisis of political credibility. I believe that we are all of the same opinion in this respect. Mr Barroso, we do not entirely agree either on the analysis of the causes of the crisis or on the best ways of resolving it. Despite the need for criticism, I would like to emphasise that we on the left are aware of our responsibility for the European Union. The idea of European unity is a left-wing idea which has been defended by many left-wingers past and present. We will continue to defend this idea in the future and we will make sure that it is not surrendered to the profit interests of the markets and the speculators. I am convinced that Europe needs much more cooperation, rather than a further withdrawal into national interest. Europe needs a jointly coordinated, democratically legitimate, economic, fiscal and social policy based on solidarity. Therefore, we will support you, Mr Barroso, when you finally present the promised legislative proposals, which have been called for by Parliament, as the first steps towards comprehensive regulation of the financial markets, taxation of financial market transactions and Eurobonds in order to reaffirm the principle of solidarity in the European Union. We will continue to emphasise the value of solidarity between states and between people and the urgent need for it. Solidarity does not just involve financial aid. It also involves resisting the governments’ mania for austerity measures. As the main representative of a genuine European institution, you should be able to support our call for a step back from this culture of austerity. The fact that the social divide within society is growing much wider also seems ominous to me. The politicians are focusing on saving the banks and making available credit facilities of hundreds of billions of euros. However, the ordinary people are being left to pick up the tab for the failed policy of deregulation and privatisation. Huge austerity programmes are being imposed on them, they have to work longer hours and their wages and benefits are being cut. They are at the mercy of the governments’ austerity programmes. Social justice is simply being trampled underfoot and we cannot go on like this. The mass demonstrations in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are making this quite clear. Finally, I would like to say that either we will take a joint route out of the crisis based on solidarity, which will allow the EU to emerge from the crisis in a better, more social, more sustainable and even more democratic form, or there will be no solution for the EU as a whole, with damaging after-effects that are hard to predict. (Applause)

 Mr President, it is true that this is a different problem. However, I would like to make it quite clear where I believe the risks lie. I think I have explained that. We will not solve any of the problems of the 21st century by withdrawing to the level of the nation states. (Applause)
 This is why I am also defending the Community method. That is what I wanted to explain. Otherwise we need, of course, to differentiate clearly between all these things. However, the basis must be that the countries of Europe can come to a solution together. That is why the European Union exists. As individual countries they will not achieve anything and will slide back into the Middle Ages. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, tomorrow, this House will vote on the tightening up and expansion of the Stability Pact. If the package of measures goes through as negotiated, then public borrowing will be penalised in practical terms. The Member States will have to introduce extreme cuts and savings. My group believes that this is the wrong approach, however that is not important right now. My question to you is: what do you think needs to be done to improve revenue for the Member States? Do we not need urgent measures to bring to an end the ruinous race to reduce taxes in Europe with minimum tax rates for business profits and high incomes? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
I have a supplementary question. We believe that the European Central Bank is taking the right and responsible course by holding down interest rates for endangered EU States by buying up government bonds. Should we not finally abolish this taboo and approve the purchase of government bonds – provided, above all, that such purchases are subject to clear and transparent rules? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of the so-called crisis summits have produced solutions to the debt crisis and to the uncontrolled speculation. State aid is still being given to the banks and austerity measures are hitting the poorest people and the middle class hardest, particularly in the debt crisis countries, but also in Germany. This weakens overall economic demand, investment and social cohesion within the European Union. Despite many announcements, we have not succeeded in putting in place comprehensive regulations governing the financial markets. The citizens of Europe and the markets themselves obviously have doubts about the economic competence and the ability to act of those in power and of the EU institutions. I must make it clear right from the beginning that none of this pleases me. I agree with those Members who proposed that the EU constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon, should be revised. Before the treaty came into force, my group had already pointed out that it does not meet the current social, democratic and economic requirements and challenges. Please allow me to make a brief remark about the EU budget for 2012 and the medium-term financial plan, which we will soon be discussing. The more cuts we make, the less funding will be available for cohesion and structural policy, for supporting cultural institutions and for exchange programmes in the fields of education and research. However, it is precisely these policies which represent the added value offered by the EU, which allow the citizens of Europe to experience the EU at first hand and which represent the first moves towards a social union. In my opinion, anyone who calls this into question is putting the idea of the European Union at risk. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, the Polish Presidency may be able to offer some ray of hope in a time of crisis when there is little enthusiasm for Europe. A clear majority of the Polish people are positively disposed towards the EU, far more so than in many other countries. I very much welcome the openness promised in the Presidency’s programme, which includes better relations with our neighbouring states of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. As Poland’s western neighbour, Germany has had some positive experiences in relation to cooperation between regions close to national borders. There is a wide range of political challenges that we are all facing. In relation to the decisions on economic governance, we need more open, respectful cooperation between the EU institutions, in particular, between the Council and Parliament. In terms of substance, I can only reiterate that we need to start rescuing people, not just the banks. Let me say something on the reform of the EU budget. I do not believe that the budget can realistically be frozen for the medium term. Populist slogans like ‘It is time for the EU to tighten its belt’ clearly miss the point. In this time of crisis, the EU can and must demonstrate its added value by acting as an effective community based on solidarity and that is how I interpreted your speech. I believe that there is room for improvement in the agenda in relation to energy and climate policy. A new global agreement on climate change to follow on from the Kyoto Protocol will have to be reached in the coming months. The European Union must not slow this process down. I wish the Polish Presidency every success. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something. Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece. However, everything is just continuing as before. Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded. At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States. The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model. Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things. However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets. The consequences can still be felt today. I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however. Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks. In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told. In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop. Things will just carry on as before. The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy. However, we lack the courage to do this. The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with. That is where the problem lies. We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors. This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground. I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be ‘let us carry on as before’. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years. I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs. Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process. Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges. As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe. Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer. I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts. At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system. In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand. This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed. Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation. I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr Barroso, I have just one brief question. I am pleased that the G8 summit and the e-G8 forum that preceded it discussed the Internet. There are also concerns about why those with power are concerning themselves with the Internet. We are aware of how sensitive this area is. Is there any more you can tell us in this connection? Is this a one-off, or will there be further discussion? Will you be putting this on the agenda again? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 My curiosity is still somewhat unsated on this issue and I would like to ask you if you would be prepared to tell us, in general terms, about these further negotiations concerning the Internet, as this is an important and far-reaching measure for the future. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism. To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours. The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this? With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy? It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests. However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past. The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests. The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms. The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya. Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there. What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur? How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity? My group is particularly concerned with this question. The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common. They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations. The EU must respond to this demand. In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, my Group finds the results of the Council meeting inadequate. Firstly, let us consider economic policy. We have articulated our thoughts on the agreed guidelines in the area of economic policy in a hearing held last week. What we need is to overcome the neo-liberal practice of profit and competition fixing, evident in terms such as ‘flexicurity’, adjustment of retirement age, and so on. We believe that there is a need for democratically legitimised, controlled economic policy management that will prevent tax, wage and environmental dumping practices through appropriate common minimum standards that will provide effective regulation for the financial markets and prohibit the privatisation of profits, while at the same time passing on the risks to the public at large. My second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and Libya in particular. The EU Member States have become involved in a macabre situation in North Africa, particularly in Libya. We have already heard some criticism here. I would just like to emphasise one point: the dictator Gaddafi is using weapons purchased from us against the demonstrators and rebels. He is under fire from NATO troops apparently in order to protect those fighting for freedom and democracy, who are also using European and US weaponry. I would like to know the point of the existing code of honour in relation to arms dealing if such a situation can exist? Where is the support for freedom, human rights and the fight against social injustice in specific cases such as Lampedusa, where hundreds of refugees are arriving from North Africa every day? I fear that the newly cobbled together neighbourhood concept is more about European interests than an appropriate response to the needs of the partner countries. My third point relates to Japan. We still have time to discuss Japan this afternoon and tomorrow. Here too we fail to recognise a coherent European approach, at least as far as safety controls, the so-called stress tests, are concerned. I am not surprised that our citizens are asking with justified scepticism what exactly the European Union’s position is on this issue. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
My question is similar to that of Mr Schulz. For this reason I intend to focus on a particular aspect. Naturally you will understand that, in the light of our experiences with the bank stress tests, we have become more sensitive about stress tests, including those relating to nuclear power. My question relates to Euratom. I do not wish to sit as judge and jury on the huge sums of money that Euratom swallows up on research. In my personal opinion, this research funding is being spent on a technology riddled with risk. I do not believe these risks are subject to adequate common controls, nor do I believe that there is sufficient scope for joint decision-making on this issue. After all, nuclear power does not respect national borders. That is precisely where the problem lies. Is it not the case that decisions on nuclear power should be taken on a joint basis because radiation recognises no boundaries? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, what would you think of the idea of establishing a European institution for promoting renewable energies, for the environmentally sensitive provision of energy and for energy savings within the framework of the EU Treaty? Do you think this proposal would be worthy of your support as it could rid us of the risks of nuclear power more quickly? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union without effective coordination of economic policy will not work. The Stability and Growth Pact has failed – on this many experts across party-political boundaries are agreed. The problem is that politics does not seem to have made much progress. In fact, no new political concepts are in sight. Let me remind you that the stability pact’s 3% limit has been breached 73 times since 1999, 46 times in a way that is barely tolerable under the Treaty – yet in not one single case has a penalty been imposed. This non-functioning pact does not need to be revised; it simply needs to be implemented more – or rather, it needs to be implemented in the first place. Naturally, every householder and every entrepreneur knows how important it is to have sustainable budgets. However, I fear that in the forthcoming decisions on economic governance and on the European Stability Mechanism it will be all about cuts. That is not the same as a sustainable budget. No state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates. However much it saves, its debt will continue to rise – all the more so if wages, unemployment benefit and pensions have to be reduced, working hours extended, and public investment in infrastructure, education, health and so on cut back. If there is no consumption, then production will also collapse. Neither tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact nor the so-called strict conditionality of the future stability mechanism will therefore lead us to our goal. What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis-hit countries in particular, and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates. The mention of the necessity of reducing macro-economic imbalances will be problematic for so long as it is only demanded of economically weak states, while those that are economically strong are allowed to continue as before. Not only does the key word ‘solidarity’ not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I find it remarkable that unease now reigns in the majority of the groups in this House in respect of approving the use of a fast-track procedure for the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This report clearly confirms our expectation as MEPs that any future crisis-management mechanism will not create parallel structures outside the Union and that parliamentary democratic supervision should be maintained at every stage. It is just that I find myself somewhat lacking in belief in this regard. Mr Barroso did make clear yesterday that he supports both the goal of social cohesion within the Union and the Community method. All the speakers agreed with him. Thus far, however, this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that, it strikes me, is something lacking. What there was – or not – was the Merkel-Sarkozy pact. That awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism. For my group, it is clear that we cannot give our approval to any policy that aims to consolidate the budget by means of further cuts in the social sphere. The European Parliament must first be given a vote on the specific proposals for the Union’s future economic and monetary policy and the related mechanisms, as these are what this is about at its core. That, in turn, is such a fundamental decision that it must not be taken on the basis of ‘Europe by decree’ but only in accordance with the convention method laid down by the Treaty. My group is thus unable to vote in favour of what is, in many respects, a positive report. Ultimately, despite constant assertions to the contrary, this would, of course, set a precedent. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE) 
Madam President, Mr Barroso, I was pleased to note that you have appreciated the social dimension of this issue and have supported a social settlement. This will certainly be necessary. There is no need to repeat much of what my fellow Members have said as I am in complete agreement with them. I am extremely sceptical of the pact that has been presented by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. Why is this? Because their reasons for presenting it are not very clear. The fact that it has no validity is quite a different issue. They are both clever strategists. I cannot accept their claim that things simply happened this way. I believe that they mean things precisely as stated there. This is the point I would like to return to once again. I believe that this is a very serious issue. Although they believe that this clause on the indexation of wages and salaries is the right answer, I am not so sure. In black and white terms, increasing the pensionable age can also be described as a reduction in pensions. It will be extremely hard to reduce debt. After all, even countries like Germany find this very difficult. I can imagine that Ireland or Greece will find themselves in huge difficulty here. I am a little sceptical about what the proposed solution is supposed to achieve. I expect transparency in this matter. You will receive support from Parliament if you play your part in promoting greater transparency and ensuring that games like this are not played out behind Parliament’s back. If these people want to make social security cuts, they need say so clearly, rather than taking countless detours to reach an objective that you, Mr Barroso, do not share and that we certainly do not share. We are prepared to discuss the concept of coordinated European economic governance with you provided that this economic governance is worthy of the name, in other words, that it is democratic in structure and that it will help establish a sustainable, socially responsible European community. We are also willing to discuss amendments to the Treaty, for example, in relation to a social progress clause. However, we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation. This is the only way that Parliament can monitor this process. It cannot be done without information! Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, Mrs Harms mentioned something important yesterday. Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations. One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis. Quite the contrary – it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place. It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact. This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms. In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens. It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts. Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible – all of this means wage restraint and cuts. It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society. In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt. It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey. This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support. However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy. Yesterday’s debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point. We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century. Nobody wants that. Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has only been in existence for a short time. However, it is now going to be modified for the second time in just a few months because of what is alleged to be an urgent matter. As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure. We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament. Now the Council is once again under time pressure and many Heads of Government want the new Treaty modification to be implemented using the supposedly tried and tested fast-track procedure. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left opposes this approach, which is threatening to become a standard process, and is calling for Treaty modifications to be managed using the normal procedure, including the convention, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon.

Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make some brief remarks about the media law. Many speakers have mentioned this, but I will not repeat what they have said. I would just like to make one point. This is not interference in Hungarian affairs. I believe, and I have only learnt this late in life, that the media are responsible for monitoring those in power and the economy. This situation must remain unchanged. Therefore, the media must not be monitored themselves by other higher level bodies and a media authority of this kind would make this possible. For this reason, the composition of the media authority is, in our eyes, not ideal. You have clearly stated that you are prepared to change this and I hope that you do move in this direction. Otherwise, and I would like to make this quite clear, it is a Hungarian affair. Of course, there are other Member States whose media legislation we could mention in this context. This does not only relate to Hungary. I would like to say quite clearly with regard to your plans for the Council Presidency, firstly, that I welcome the fact that you have made promoting cultural diversity one of your overriding objectives. I believe that this is very important. I look forward to your initiatives to improve integration, including the integration of minorities, and you yourself have referred to the Roma. A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue. Secondly, I am pleased to see that you are committed to the enlargement negotiations and the policy with regard to our eastern neighbours. Bringing more Eastern European culture, together with the historical and social experience of the area, into the European Union can only be a good thing. For many reasons which I do not want to go into here, the European Union is still primarily a Western European institution. I would like to see your Council Presidency exerting a greater Eastern European influence. Thirdly, I will be interested to see how you handle the forthcoming reorganisation of agriculture and cohesion policy and the preparation of the European Union’s multiannual budgetary perspective. My group calls on you to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in all of this and we expect you take seriously your promise to support small and medium-sized businesses and to improve environmental protection, the sustainable use of resources and food security.

 Mr Barroso, we are all aware of how important the stability of the euro is. That being the case, there is one event that I found myself not quite able to understand. This was the debate about the increase for the rescue package, where you gave the green light but Chancellor Merkel gave the red one. My question, therefore, is whether you do not coordinate with one another at all. I appreciate that such things do happen sometimes, but this is not the first time that I have come across or heard about something like this. The media have taken a great interest in this in the meantime. Yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and Chancellor Merkel. It is an important political issue. I can understand that – believe me, I do not always see eye to eye with the Chancellor, either – but the issue concerns whether such publicly differing opinions do not help the financial speculators. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion, and the report. My question remains, however – on such an important issue, where the euro is being speculated on, at a point in time as important as this one, how can it be that your opinion comes across as uncoordinated with Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy or other Heads of Government? That is the public perception, in any case. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been dealing with the global economic and financial crisis for three years now. One of the conclusions to be drawn from this long-lasting discussion is that our measures are obviously not tackling the roots of the crisis, but simply treating the symptoms. I would like to repeat once again that decisions at EU level must not be determined by the financial markets. We must not allow the banks to get away largely scot-free, to continue speculating and to leave the Member States to take responsibility for the risky transactions that the banks have entered into. The tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause. This will restrict consumer spending and prevent the necessary economic upturn from taking place. Drastic savings measures will put other countries that are currently at risk, such as Portugal and Spain, in the same position as Greece and Ireland. Simply readjusting the financial instruments or putting new safety nets in place will not help. A permanent mechanism for preserving financial stability must include measures which regulate the activities of the markets. These include, among other things, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards. It is also important for us to change the statute of the European Central Bank to allow it to provide direct financial aid for ailing states, while circumventing the banks. These are the first steps we should be taking, but they are long overdue. To make the situation absolutely clear, a narrow-minded national approach is blocking the regulations needed for effective control of the financial markets. The Heads of State or Government are preventing us from making progress in the right direction. I include the Chancellor of Germany among them. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in response to Mr Schulz’s questions, you said that the Eurobonds proposal will probably not be successful. Previously, we were told that nothing would come of the financial transaction tax, and other proposals have also come to nothing. We are now in the third year following the financial crisis and I am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package – that would, of course, be an additional measure – or whether we have to expect that, by the weekend, yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others. My question is: how expensive is this delay, especially as it is clearly costing a lot of money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, I just have a brief additional question: are there any other instruments that are still under discussion? I feel rather poorly informed in this regard. Something needs to be done, and we are probably in agreement that the instruments that we have at our disposal should actually be used. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, if the Heads of State or Government have agreed to create a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area, I can only welcome that. The results of the work, lasting several months, of Mr Van Rompuy’s Task Force on economic governance leave a great deal to be desired – although my views on them vary. The attempt is being made to carry out as stringent a control on the budgets as possible in order to avoid long-term deficits, but the cautious recovery from the crisis will immediately be put at risk again by the radical cutting of public expenditure. That is not only completely counterproductive, I also think it is absurd. It seems that we have learnt nothing from our past experience with the Stability and Growth Pact. You cannot impose additional monetary penalties on a country that is already heavily in debt. The bail-out ban and the Stability and Growth Pact destroy the solidarity between the States in the monetary union. Does the economy dictate our policies? Once again, the consequences of the crisis will be borne by the people. We can expect wage dumping and social dumping, cuts in the education sector and a rise in unemployment. This will further increase the burden of the countries affected and make their recovery more difficult. It makes absolutely no sense to increase the pressure on countries like Ireland, Greece or Portugal. Rather, the large economic disparities in Europe should be reduced, in other words we need economic governance. We want a social and fair Europe, built on the principle of solidarity. The precedence of policy over economy must be retained or restored. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected. All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this. We also agree that we must provide aid quickly. A lot of sensible things have already been said. It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them. There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage. We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate. Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction. I would like to make one last point. We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon have emphasised the fact that it does away with the democratic deficit in the EU. In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control. The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard. I repeat: it is a minimum standard. This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism. It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets. New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent. When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament. The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States. Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe. The net contributors seem to have forgotten this. While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe. Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage. The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued. In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget. We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity. This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States. It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities. To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms.

 – (DE)
 Mr President, I understand your economic questions, Mr Rübig, and they are very profound in economic terms, which I respect. However, I believe that this is about the relationship between the budget and the European Parliament and its rights. That is a different subject. It has to do with products, but in a quite different sense. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to admit that the Treaty of Lisbon and its social commitments read well. However, we cannot ignore the fact that hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Brussels and other European capitals. They were protesting against a mistaken and unsocial policy towards the crisis. We have hardly begun to turn the corner from this, the worst of crises, yet we are already hearing from many governments that national debts need to be reined in. The emergency parachutes that are the rescue plans need to be folded away, they say, and investment programmes abolished. The Commission is calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be tightened up. States in which reasonable wages and salaries are paid, in which the labour market still follows rules, or in which social security systems are too ‘social’ – which means too expensive – are to be penalised. The banksters are carrying on as if nothing had happened. Pensions and wages are to be cut, consumption taxes perhaps increased. Contributions to social health insurance are rising while services decline. In the light of the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking, Laval and Rueffert cases, it is not only the trade unions that fear that the social balance of the European Union is in a precarious position. The call of the trade unions for a social protection clause deserves our full support. Employee rights, trade union rights and social protection need to be given at least the same significance as – and, indeed, precedence over – the internal market and freedom to provide services. This needs to be clearly laid down in primary law. I am pointing out these facts because the relevant paragraphs merely look good – in reality, they change nothing. Human dignity cannot be ensured without minimum social standards. A social progress clause would improve the badly damaged reputation of the European Union amongst the populace and help to stem social fears. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have provided an impressive insight into the tasks of the various policy areas. Nevertheless, you, and all of us here, have to admit that the trust of European citizens is fading. Mr Verhofstadt has drawn our attention to this and so I will not address the matter in any more detail. These are reliable studies. Citizens have also seen rescue and economic recovery packages amounting to billions of euro flow to the so-called system-relevant banks, and they have seen dangerously high national debts pile up everywhere. Now they are asking themselves who is responsible for this, particularly when, despite a better economic outlook, they are being hit by the Member States’ austerity measures. These austerity measures will result in rising prices for public services, cuts in social benefits, cuts in education services, pay cuts, an extended working life in the face of uncertain pensions and often precarious employment situations. The protest goes far beyond the states hit by the crisis. Today, the unions are striking in France and on 29 September, strike action will be taken in many towns and cities in Europe against the Member States’ austerity policies. Citizens were promised that the Treaty of Lisbon would make the European Union more social and more democratic. The EU, including the Commission and the Parliament, would simply lose credibility if it now said that the Member States are responsible for the austerity measures. Effective financial market reforms, for example, like a ban on hedge funds, or a ban on speculation on raw materials and food derivatives, or even a financial transaction tax, but also the move away from the flexicurity ideology, are now most definitely the responsibility of the European Union. This is something that we all need to involve ourselves with over the next few months. The situation in the Union varies greatly for the different sections of the population and it is full of inconsistencies. The social division in the societies of the EU countries has, in any case, widened dangerously once again. In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, a large amount of money, billions of euro, have gone to rescue or to stand as security for the banks. It has not reached the people with real social needs or been put into education. No one would want to dispute or belittle the EU’s successes. However, papering over the very real inconsistencies in the European Union will not help anyone. I, too, would like to finish by saying something about the Roma in France. I believe that the European Union has a good tradition. However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values. These moral values and human rights apply to French, Polish, English, Spanish or German people in the European Union, just as they do for all Sinti and Roma who live in Europe. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would like to come back to what Mr Barroso so rightly said against racism and xenophobia. However, in this regard, I would like to say that I am still not satisfied with the debate about the Roma, which we will, of course, continue this afternoon. There are side issues being debated that are extremely dangerous. In Germany, for example, we currently have the Sarrazin debate, which is extremely problematic. In this regard, the fact is being overlooked that in Germany, there are poorly educated sections of the population – of Germans, immigrants and also of Roma and nationals of other countries – who are all relatively poorly catered for in schools and we have insufficient means and a lack of smart methods to be able to really help these children. This breeds racism. Finally, I would like to say that sometimes, racism can arise unintentionally. I would not like to forget the debate about Greece. In this regard, I have seen things in my country, which is not particularly xenophobic, that I had not thought possible. We must remain sensitive to nationalistic, xenophobic and racist statements in the European Union. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for averting imminent crises, involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy, which entail rescuing the banks, on the one hand, and cuts in social security, salaries and pensions, on the other, we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. In our view, these proposals from the Commission on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact are taking the wrong tack. The Commission, following in the footsteps of the working group headed by President Van Rompuy, does not want to modify the Pact’s content, but instead wants to tighten the sanctions and enforce compliance. Both the Commission and Council are calling for further controls and penalties for Member States in deficit. This has not worked in the past and will not work in the future. However, we in the European Parliament’s Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left are pleased, at any rate, that the harshest penalties proposed by the Commission for countries in deficit were not applied. Regulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency. We will do our part to resolve the situation. Europe’s citizens already have to pay; the Council now ought finally to swing into action as well. The problems with the Stability and Growth Packet are not down to lack of compliance or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit to the Maastricht target of 3% of new debt. This may stall growth in the euro area, which is still feeble and at risk. The current economic imbalances in the EU must be eliminated, as this is what speculators are making their living from. One of the ways to do this is for the countries with strong economies to drop their aggressive export strategies which have devastating consequences for the other countries. These countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead. Criteria such as the unemployment rate and the prevalence of poverty must be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. What is needed is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the results of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday of last week must be measured against the global and European challenges that we are facing. Will it be possible to eliminate the causes of the unprecedented crisis in European financial markets at the beginning of May or at least to start taking steps in the right direction? What proposals are being made to the citizens of Europe and the financial markets to rectify the malfunctions in the system? The Council has proudly stated that the banks, which are responsible for causing the crisis, must pay part of the costs and their activities must be more strictly regulated. I welcome this, but in the meantime, I have stopped believing that it will actually happen. You have decided first of all on an international bank levy which does not have unanimous support even within the EU and which has been completely rejected by some G20 countries. It seems unrealistic to think that this decision could ever be implemented. Secondly, in the case of the introduction of a general financial transaction tax, there is only a requirement to investigate whether it is feasible. I doubt that this will really boost the confidence of the players on the global financial market or prevent speculation from taking place or cause the G20 to adopt a resolution on this subject. Thirdly, the stricter measures taken against deficit offenders in a financial and economic crisis are more likely to put the recovery at risk, reduce consumer spending and, in particular, cause socially deprived people to tighten their belts even further. As a result, a greater reduction in the state’s revenue base is inevitable. This will lead to additional austerity measures, which will call into question the financial viability of the Europe 2020 strategy that we have just adopted. Fourthly, no one is taking the opportunity to reinforce the Member States’ revenue base by introducing an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds and green taxes, by raising taxation on high incomes and assets and by ensuring the socially just distribution of taxes. I find this very strange. My fifth point is that the crisis is undermining the democratic foundations of our society. The regulations imposed by the EU on the countries in crisis are also contributing to this. Cuts in social security spending, in wages and pensions and in public services, together with the raising of the pension age, are all causing the poverty gap to widen and the number of people living in poverty to increase even further. I am very much opposed to this. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticism from our group is not directed at whether we need the newly created euro rescue package, but at how it will be implemented. As in 2009, it is once more all about rescuing the banks and the financial sector. Yet again, they will not be helping to pay the cost of averting imminent crises. The EU countries that are in difficulty are once more being ordered to make cuts in social security spending, in public investments, in public services and in salaries and pensions and to increase the pension age. The plan to tighten up the stability pact is pure sado-monetarism. Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are being asked to pay for the crisis which was caused by the failure of European economic policy and gambling on the financial markets. However, this orgy of cuts will send demand on the internal market and tax revenues in Europe through the floor and, as a result, the recession will return. From our perspective, this policy is fundamentally wrong and will not lead to healthy public finances. We are hearing once again that structural reforms should bring about increased growth. More deregulation is to be introduced into the labour markets and the European internal market, while public services will be privatised by means of public-private partnerships. As a result, industrial relations will end up in an even more uncertain and precarious position. This will cause an increase in poverty and social exclusion in the very year when we are supposed to be combating these two phenomena. This is what the Europe 2020 strategy is allegedly intended to fight against. Where will the investment in education, research, green jobs and combating poverty come from if all the Member States are adopting austerity programmes? To put it bluntly, the Europe 2020 strategy is not worth the paper which its very modest objectives are written on. Our group supports the protest campaigns by trade unions and social movements against the catastrophic course taken by the European Union. We agree with the European Trade Union Confederation that an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds, green taxes and heavy taxation of high incomes, assets and inheritances will allow for investment in the environmental and social reconstruction of our industrial societies. Firstly, Europe needs a European social and environmental programme of investment in the future to overcome the crisis. Secondly, it needs decisive measures to break the power of the financial markets and, thirdly, it needs European economic governance and more economic democracy in the interests of the workers. We must have a social Europe or there will soon be no common Europe left. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the most recent Council meetings indicate that far-reaching changes are under way. We are currently experiencing a process of governmentalisation of European policy. The Treaty of Lisbon praised the role of Parliament and the strengthening of that role. We have also spoken out in praise of this. Fundamental agreements are now being reached between the governments and inconceivably large amounts of money are being spent. Until now, the parliaments have had little say in the matter and we must put a stop to this. The method used by those in government has resulted in huge sums being spent to rescue banks which are themselves responsible for getting heavily into debt. These governments have saved casino capitalism using taxpayers’ money. However, they have taken a very hesitant approach to rescuing the states that are in debt. Somewhere, they managed to find EUR 750 billion. The question is whether the money printing press will save economic development. I believe that it is more likely to save the banks’ capital. However, the European Union must be more than just a free internal market with a single currency. Mr Barroso is right when he says that without an economic union, we can forget the monetary union. However, I cannot yet see any clear outlines. Persisting with the failed Stability and Growth Pact has relatively little to do with the sensible coordination of economic policy. What we are lacking is a social union. We are lacking the lasting and effective re-regulation of the financial sector. We are lacking a coordinated tax policy and wage policy and a tax on financial transactions. Although we have been talking about this tax for a long time, it remains just talk. It is time to safeguard the social state by means of the EU institutions, not to dismantle it. The Greeks and other nations are afraid because they can see the measures that are being taken on the social side. It is time to fight for the harmonisation of social standards at a high level. Hedge funds must be banned and tax havens abolished. We are making very slow progress in combating the crisis in the financial markets. In the light of the speed with which the speculators are acting, we are doing far too little. During emergencies like those that we are repeatedly being faced with, it is totally wrong to nationalise the billions which are being spent as losses and privatise the profits. The banks must not be allowed direct access to taxpayers’ money with the support of the state. Incidentally, one thing is clear to me, and that is that in the current conditions, we will have to redefine the term ‘bank robber’. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must, of course, provide assistance to Greece. However, the so-called rescue operation also has some absurd elements. With France and Germany acting like great powers, the process of reaching a decision on the assistance package was very expensive and protracted. For years, the financial markets have been increasingly deregulated and now everyone is surprised that it is expensive. Who will now pay the price for the political errors? The workers, ordinary citizens? Banks are not being placed under any obligation. No, once again it is the taxpayers who are to pick up the tab and dig deep in their pockets to pay for the profiteering of the banks. Once again, dependent workers are to have to accept pay cuts. With the dictates from the International Monetary Fund, any semblance of a democratic decision-making process has been eliminated. In the case of the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico, application of the polluter-pays principle has been called for. I believe that is right. Anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt. At the moment – at least in Germany – banks do not even have to pay back the debts that they have taken on and with which they are happily speculating against the euro – yes, against the euro. Furthermore, they are still speculating, even though we have been saying for a long time that something needs to be done about this. Proposals for what could be done are on the table. A ban on trading credit derivatives and on short selling, the introduction of a financial market transaction tax, special levies on bonuses in the financial sector, a legally binding bank and insurance levy – all of these proposals are on the table. Of course, Greece must also do its homework. Like other countries of the European Union, Greece should also tax wealth, combat corruption and reduce its arms expenditure. Mr Cohn-Bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this. I will therefore omit the facts in this regard and endorse what he said in his speech. I can understand people in Athens going out into the streets and protesting. What I cannot understand is the violence. I agree with everyone who has expressed sympathy for the victims, whose suffering is most regrettable. Violence will achieve the opposite of what the protesters and honest demonstrators want. We must call for an end to the violence. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the decision made by the aviation safety authorities not to put passenger safety at risk was absolutely right, even if this meant closing European airspace for several days and involved financial losses for the airlines. In my opinion, it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk. What does ‘at their own risk’ actually mean in this case? I welcome the fact that the Commission is considering authorising special State aid for the airlines, which would otherwise be in serious financial difficulties as a result of the current situation. We will be talking later about employment in the European Union. If the EU and the Member States can at least help to prevent things from getting even worse, this is the right thing to do. However, in return for the provision of State aid, the airlines must give a binding undertaking not to make staff cuts or salary cuts. They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation. It is high time that the Commission put in place a permanent common European monitoring system for aviation safety. This monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping. I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach. Competition and the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to take priority over the safety of human lives. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, you have spoken about your work programme and it has been discussed in Parliament. You have said that you want to follow up on the critical remarks. I have one question. Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it. However, I have the impression that very little has changed in the way the banks do business. I would also be interested to hear the answer to another question. Do you think that we and the Commission have done enough? If not, what do you believe it is still necessary to do in order to combat the causes of the financial crisis in the longer term, so that the banks cannot go on doing business in the way they currently are? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I have another brief question. The chair of Deutsche Bank, Dr Ackermann, is a difficult man to make an impression on. He has recently said outright that he wants to make returns of 25%. Do you not think that this flies in the face of the measures taken by the Commission and the individual governments? He is not changing anything. He has said that he wants to make returns of 25% once again. This is what Dr Ackermann, the chair of Deutsche Bank, which is an extremely important bank, is saying. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, it is a good thing that the Heads of State or Government were able to agree an emergency package, but this is hardly a really European solution. The German Government has, for tactical electoral reasons – with regard to North Rhine-Westphalia – gone quite far down the road of populism. The agreement, then, was hanging by the thread of the conversation between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. It is no package to cover the citizens. The objective of the funding mechanism is to consist, and I quote, of ‘incentives for the fastest possible return by the financial market to setting high-risk prices’. Economic policy coordination is to be built on the failed principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. The State and the citizens are to make savings, while the financial markets – the banks – are to evaluate whether enough savings have been made. I regard that as a dubious procedure. In the EU there is currently an unemployment rate of 10% – the highest since 1998. Over 20% of under-25-year-olds are out of work. There is a need to say very specifically where we want to make savings. Otherwise, I fear the worst. Why has the Council not agreed on an increase in the cohesion and structural funds or an immediate prohibition on trading credit derivatives? Why has it postponed agreement on specific targets to combat poverty in the EU indefinitely? I am not saying, incidentally, that they have done so deliberately, but to all intents and purposes the postponement will endure indefinitely. I consider that to be a scandal in this, the European Year for Combating Poverty. June this year is much too late. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, it is rare for me to agree with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission. However, when they both call for solidarity with Greece and warn of renationalisation, then I can only agree with them, because what they say is correct. Moreover, recently in Strasbourg, we heard Mr Barroso thinking aloud as to whether the worst of the speculation on the financial markets should be banned outright. The increasing social chasm in the European Union and within the Member States can no longer be overlooked by anyone, yet the pressing issues associated with this are not on the agenda of the Heads of State at their first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda. As you are aware, my group is not at all keen on this strategy as it has been drafted by the Commission, because it is based on the failed ideology of competition which led to the crisis. We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests. EU 2020 is miles away from this. It is quite something, however, when individual members of the Federal German Government turn up and thunder against the few binding goals of the EU 2020 strategy, such as for the employment quota, for research and education and for combating poverty – and that in the European Year for Combating Poverty! I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the Heads of Government. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr Barroso, last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy. It contains important objectives. The Council has now imposed an austerity programme on Greece, which, in my opinion, makes the achievement of these goals impossible, with one State having 3% of the gross domestic product of the EU. However, you continue to persist with the failed Stability and Growth Pact. At the same time, several Member States are calling for a European monetary fund or even economic governance. My questions are as follows. Are you going to review your EU 2020 proposal again in order to integrate the idea of the monetary fund and economic governance so as to initiate a move away from tax and wage dumping and from the prevailing competitive ideology? Are you going to take measures immediately, together with the Member States, to prohibit speculation against the euro by the very banks that have just been bailed out using taxpayers’ money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 I am not entirely satisfied. The issue is that taxpayers’ money is being used to speculate against the Greek State. Some of this taxpayers’ money comes from German banks and it has also been lent out by German banks. Yet, while we are repeatedly told that some sort of measures will be taken, nothing actually happens. I am therefore rather disappointed that so little has been done to simply prohibit certain things in the EU so as to put a stop to such speculation once and for all and allow us to genuinely concentrate on growth and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, in times of need, you discover who your friends are, as the saying goes. There are 27 governments in the European Union trying – each in its own way – to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries. This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens. The euphemistic wage restraint policy, reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age, family, sickness and desired education have all been mentioned. The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets. The banks have already made more progress than the states. Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank, which, in Germany, were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers’ money, are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of excessively expensive government bonds in Greece. Taxpayers’ money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal, honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer people are fleeing. (Heckling)
 Believe me, I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany. However, one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief, while at the same time, the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes. Who will have to find this money, though? I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet. Was it not Germany, formerly the world’s highest exporter, that years ago separated wage increases from productivity, thus resulting in social dumping? In ancient Greek theatre, a crisis means an opportunity – yes, the challenge of a turning point. In order to bring about such a turning point, we must demand that a statutory minimum wage finally be put in place. The same work in the same place must receive the same wage. We need harmonisation of tax types within the Union, but above all, we need genuine European regulation and control of the financial markets and a real European economic and finance policy, coordinated on the basis of solidarity, with binding social and environmental targets.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT agreement was negotiated on the basis of a dubious procedure and quickly pushed through only one day before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to circumvent Parliament. However, I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement. We have big brother’s little sister waiting for our approval. Mrs Clinton believes that she can persuade the Members of this Parliament to do something which we would not accept from our own governments. From my point of view, it is fundamentally wrong for alleged terrorism investigators to have such extensive access to databases, because this undermines people’s self-determination over their own personal data. Personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used. In addition, the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end. It will not be possible to take legal action to discover the whereabouts of the data or to claim damages for its illegal use by third countries. This gives the state precedence over its citizens, who will all be reduced to the status of objects of suspicion. The Member States are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the EU. To give some examples in Germany, should Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees? Will it now become the norm for the German Government to buy from tax investigators data that has been obtained illegally? We find ourselves in a situation in which Parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision. Why should Google be able to set data thresholds in future? It is important to combat terrorism and, in particular, its causes, and I believe that we all agree on this, but not at the cost of fundamental rights. In this context, I have heard many speeches which refer to the EU as a community of values. We are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in September 2009, I had to tell you that your political guidelines were continuing a failed Commission policy. Your neoliberal guidelines do not reveal a strategy for more social justice, nor do they provide better protection for Europe against crises. They provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe. Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme. You can expect no applause for this from my group. Already during this new parliamentary term, this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously, and I very much welcome that. I am thinking of the new Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission and of the rejection of one of the candidate Commissioners, and I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will once again be conscientious in its addressing of the SWIFT agreement. Transparency and fairness are vital in the agreements between the institutions – only when we have these can we begin to talk about policy. It is about the people of Europe and the rest of the world, it is about good jobs and more rights to a good education and fair pay, it is about their right to peaceful development and an intact environment. Therefore, Mr Barroso, my group will not support your guidelines or your staffing proposal. Prepare yourself for our harsh, but fair, exchange of views with you and your College. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group also participated actively in the hearings of the candidates. Some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on us. We are less enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolios. That also includes the rather mysterious – although perhaps soon to be less mysterious – area of responsibility of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is also Vice-President of the Commission. However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge. In this regard, all of our questions related primarily to political projects. In what direction should the European integration process go? Which measures are most important to the Commission candidate? There were far too many vague answers to these questions and answers that, politically speaking, we do not support. Despite claims of a more social Europe, they persisted in advocating a route towards deregulation, privatisation or the flexicurity concept. The flexibility of workers was the top priority and social security was right at the bottom. Climate protection is on the agenda, but we are not seeing a move away from coal-powered generation of electricity or from nuclear power. I do not see the EU taking a leading role in climate protection and in development aid. Nothing has been said about consistent disarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons within Europe. Mr Barroso, Mr President, as much as I appreciate the candidates coming forward for the hearing, my group is unable to give your College a positive vote. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency. I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU. On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy. However, even though it has been acknowledged that a new political approach is needed, where is it? I have not seen it. With the new Commission, the new Parliament and the President of the European Council, however, there would now be a chance to start a totally new debate. Of course, there is the new treaty and the still to be implemented opportunity for the citizens initiative, too. Our starting point is clear: our priority, above all others, in particular, above the interests of profits, must remain the social and environmental concerns of the people. That needs to become the new basic principle of the European Union’s strategies and legislation, as only then will the citizens perceive the EU as representing progress in the long term. My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax. In yesterday’s debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future. We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt. Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I have a question for you about the Tobin tax. This tax is a worthwhile proposal, but as yet, no one has introduced it. Everyone says that it will never be introduced unless all the Member States do so at the same time. I am now afraid, after the decision at the European summit, which I welcome, that this will once again be postponed, because we are not all starting at the same time. I would like to know what your opinion on this is and what you think are the chances of the Tobin tax being introduced. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would like to welcome the two candidates on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Above all, we welcome the fact that a woman has been elected. We assume that the two candidates for the high offices will not only focus on the content of their responsibilities, but will also develop a cooperative approach to Parliament. We expect the Council to deal more closely with the social issues resulting from the crisis and to draw the right conclusions. Billions have so far been paid to the bankers, but there has been virtually no help for the ordinary people. Mr Schulz is right when he says that the casino is open again, but at the same time, poverty and, in particular, child poverty is growing. Four million jobs were lost throughout Europe as a result of the crisis. According to reports from the Commission, this figure could increase to seven million over the course of the next year. We know that estimates of this kind are often lower than the real figures. For example, 1.5 million people in Germany are on short-time work and it is important to emphasise this. However, growing unemployment and poverty are the first signs of even greater inequality of opportunity which will have a major impact on educational opportunities. We also need to discuss this subject. The question that arises is whether the Heads of State or Government will find ways out of the crisis which combine the European concept of integration with social progress and which have a real impact for the citizens of Europe. Instead of exit strategies for the economic recovery programmes and mandatory budget consolidation, we need a change of policy. I have just three observations to make about this. Firstly, we expect the Council to give a statement on its position on the plans for the 2020 strategy, which is intended to replace the failed Lisbon Strategy. Innovation and knowledge, combating exclusion, green economic strategies, a digital Europe – as a list of slogans, this does not sound too bad. However, we urgently need concrete proposals describing how all of this will be implemented. Secondly, the Council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets. I have a number of legitimate questions about how the Council can bring this into line with existing treaties, because in some cases, restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments are not permitted or wanted. We are interested to see how you will achieve this. Thirdly, I would like to emphasise once again that the Council must give a clear signal after Copenhagen that a binding climate change agreement is needed. Voluntary commitments have never achieved the desired objective. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 What I found pleasing about the special summit was that there was a gender balance. We would like to pay tribute to that achievement. I would also like to add that we will continue to support you if you continue to maintain this gender balance. We now have two new figureheads for the European Union to deal with, about whom all sides have said that they will have to grow into their roles. That, of course, will always be the case. There is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights. I see it like this: today’s lightweights are tomorrow’s heavyweights, and vice versa
. Many a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next. That notwithstanding, we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome. The social consequences, especially, are giving us lots to deal with. In Europe, tens of millions of people are affected by unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The number of crisis victims is going through the roof. In the developing world, the consequences are much worse. Are you prepared, Mr Barroso, together with the new Commission, to learn the lessons of the wrong turns taken through radical free-market policies? Are you prepared to bring about an urgently needed change of policy to put people ahead of profits and social interests ahead of competitive ones? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by all 27 Member States. Many will be celebrating this as a great success, but my group will not be joining in these celebrations. I have stated the reasons for this many times in this House and I do not intend to do so again. Unfortunately, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply for the citizens of three Member States gives me doubts about the EU’s great progress in the protection of fundamental rights. I mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and Václav Havel’s speech. However, precisely because the Left in Europe wants a social, peaceful and environmentally sustainable European integration, we will also continue to use the framework provided by the treaty for this purpose. We have done this up to now, and we will continue to do so. In this connection, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament will now have more rights. Amidst all the rejoicing, the Heads of State or Government would also have been well advised to use their recent summit for more tangible policies. The greatest challenge facing the world is climate change. In the run-up to the world climate conference in Copenhagen, the European Union has, unfortunately, lost the leading role that it had set itself. For one thing, the substance of the commitments to reduce CO2
 emissions does not correspond to what is actually needed. Moreover, it is unacceptable that the EU Member States quite clearly want to avoid their financial responsibilities, even though this is a situation where we cannot afford to delay our action. It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine-growing region – although I do not begrudge you that. It is quite simply about survival and, incidentally, also about peace in our world. Climate change is already causing poverty and hunger and forcing millions of people to flee from their homelands. Everyone in this Chamber has surely spoken at one time or another of global challenges that cannot be overcome at national level. Climate protection, peace and combating poverty are just such challenges. If the European Union does not act in a consistent and exemplary manner in this regard, it will lose its acceptance as an international player. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, there has been much speculation over staffing issues during the last three months and over the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which my group has rejected for three good reasons. In simplistic terms, firstly we want priority to be given to a social Europe rather than to a radical market orientation. Secondly, we want disarmament instead of the development of military capabilities and, thirdly, we want more direct democracy rather than a Europe made up of elites. We should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content. While we are arguing over names and positions, more and more people are losing their jobs. The banks have, of course, been rescued. At the same time, Mr Barroso is calling for us to bring an end to the economic recovery plans soon – yesterday the deadline was set for 2011 – and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be reduced quickly. This will mean reductions in salaries and pensions, cuts in public services and social security provision, higher value added tax and a lack of collective agreements. One current example of this can be found in the German commercial cleaning industry where workers have been on strike for three days. These are the problems which are affecting people in Europe and these are the problems which the Council should be dealing with. Instead of this, the main subject of concern is adding clauses to the Treaty of Lisbon to encourage the Czech President to sign it. If this is really as simple as it seems to be in practice, I would ask the Heads of Government to think more carefully about a social progress clause in the Treaty of Lisbon. That would be much more appropriate. At the beginning of the parliamentary term, a series of positive proposals were made concerning a more social EU policy. This did not just relate to the social progress clause. It was also about a new economic recovery plan for Europe in order to create and retain jobs and about increased investment and sustainable environmental growth. A European Employment Pact for more and better jobs, for equal pay, for more rights for employees and better working conditions was called for. There were discussions about increased solidarity among the Member States and ensuring the sustainability of the social security and pension systems. I have not yet identified any strategy within the policies of the Member States or the policies of the Commission which might lead us towards these objectives. Of course, the Council must now consider the appointments to the new Commission and the possible changes to the Treaty of Lisbon. However, the focus must be on the problems I have referred to and on their solutions. My group’s vote on the College of Commissioners will be dependent on this. Lothar Bisky,  
Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, you are calling for us to leave behind the economic stimulus programmes soon and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be quickly reduced. Yet even your most recent forecast promises growth in EU GDP of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009 as a whole, that would represent a 4% decrease. According to your own forecasts, unemployment rates in the EU will rise to over 11% in 2010. Do you not think that early, drastic cuts in public expenditure could stop the small beginnings of recovery in their tracks? Or do you believe that the financial sector, for the moment, has got over the problem and the ordinary people should bear the costs of the crisis? Already, you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia, Hungary and Romania: lower wages, lower pension benefits, fewer public services and higher VAT. Is that your idea of a social Europe? Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated mandatory referendums on the Reform Treaty throughout Europe. Voters in Ireland were the only ones with the opportunity to make their decision directly a year and a half ago. If we want the people to decide, then we must accept the result, even if we do not like it. The government in Ireland went against the principle of democracy and conducted a second referendum, partly as a result of pressure from other Member States. Now they have the result they wanted. We on the Left abide by the principle of democracy, but our concern over the political orientation of the EU remains. The number of ‘no’ votes in Ireland indicates that we are not the only ones with this concern. Our three main points of criticism are, firstly, that the previous policy of liberalising the financial markets, tax competition, decoupling of financial policy from economic policy and the dismantling of the social state contributed to the economic and financial crisis. As a result, this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in Europe. Other than declarations of intent, very little has happened so far in terms of the regulation of the financial markets. On the contrary, while the unemployment figures are rising, the big banks are once again expecting large profits. The Treaty of Lisbon will continue this market economy policy with free competition. This is something that we cannot support. Instead, we call for a fundamentally different approach to tackling social challenges. Our aim is the introduction of a social progress clause with minimum wages applying throughout the EU – the same pay for the same work in the same place. We must combat wage dumping. Our second point of criticism is that the call for the Member States to gradually improve their military capabilities is incompatible with the aims of the Left, as is the entrenchment of a European armaments agency in primary European law. We will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests. We do not want this kind of treaty; we want a treaty of disarmament rather than armament. It is paradoxical to be referred to as an opponent of Europe for this reason. Anyone in Europe who is in favour of armament is classed as a friend of Europe, but anyone in Europe who is in favour of disarmament is classed as an enemy of Europe. That is politically absurd! So, the referendum in Ireland has taken place and, even if it did not turn out exactly as we would have wanted, we on the Left will continue to work to achieve more direct democracy in Europe. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you represent the continuity of a policy, Mr Barroso, which has contributed to the greatest economic crisis in post-war history. While the casinos in the major financial centres are reopening, the citizens of the world are footing the bill. The consequences of the crisis are unemployment, poverty, lower incomes and less education. You maintain that the financial crisis came primarily from the US and that it was only the bankers who caused the collapse. We say that the political system, including the policies of the EU Commission, was responsible for promoting casino capitalism. The ideology of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation has led to the crisis. Continuing as we have done in the past will result in an even more serious crisis. The political system must take responsibility, learn from its mistakes and give up its neo-liberal ideals. European policy must focus consistently on the interests of the people of Europe. I cannot identify a focus of this kind in your guidelines. However, I am pleased that in your remarks today, social issues were given greater importance than was the case a year ago. I would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples. You want to adhere to the Lisbon strategy. However, the people of Europe need good jobs at wages which will allow them to live with dignity. We need to put on the agenda a reduction and not an extension of working hours. We expect the new Commission to restructure the Posting of Workers Directive. Europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach. For this reason, we have proposed, together with some others, a legally binding clause on social progress and a charter of public services, which will give precedence to social security and services of general interest over internal market regulations. From what you have said, I understand that you do not think much of this. In the Zimmermann report, the European Parliament calls for a minimum wage of at least 60% of the average income in all Member States. You maintain that you can do nothing about this. I think that you could, for example, by means of the employment policy guidelines. You are focusing solely on the Stability and Growth Pact which has proved to be an ineffective tool, in particular, during the crisis. We want a social pact to replace the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact. You believe that a few new financial supervision regulations will keep the greed of the financial world in check. We are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements. You, and I quote, ‘support every paragraph of the Treaty of Lisbon’. We want a social Europe instead of a continuation of the radical focus on the internal market. We want a commitment to disarmament and civil conflict management instead of the continuing growth in military capability. You see Europe as a leading power and we want to spread the ideology of free trade and marketisation of all areas of life throughout the world. We stand for intercultural, multilateral dialogue and the greatest possible support for developing countries in overcoming the economic, food, financial and climate crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, let us elect a Commission together which sets itself the objective of a social, peaceful, economically sustainable and democratic European Union. If we want to gain acceptance among the people of Europe for the EU project, we need a break with radical free-market concepts and more direct democracy. In this case, Mr Barroso is the wrong man for the job of president. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has presented an ambitious work programme which includes a proposal for more transparency. Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing. Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy. The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis. They are innocent parties. Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis. I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers. Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism. We are keen to see what happens with the Baltic Sea Strategy and I would be behind the President-in-Office of the Council if he were to focus on dialogue with Russia. We would also like the European Union to support the pledges of President Obama and President Medvedev with regard to the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The European Union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament. The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers. Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy. This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars. Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place. The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures. We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries. We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment. I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, I am pleased that a neighbour from Poland has become President of this House. I come from eastern Germany and work near Słubice. Słubice and Frankfurt/Oder are both part of a united Europe. I would like to thank you for focusing in particular on the continued integration of Eastern and Western Europe. There is still much to do in this respect, as we are all aware. However, I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe. I hope that I will soon be able to speak to you in more depth. I have started to work towards this. Two of my sons speak Polish. I once had the honour of presenting the Andrzej Wajda film prize to the director Andreas Dresen and of making a speech to mark the occasion. Andrzej Wajda and other Polish directors are part of our European culture. I hope that Western Europe and Eastern Europe will not forget the special achievements of Eastern European culture.

 I rejected the report because it advocates a further militarisation of the EU and demands military autonomy via increased investment in armament, defence and military sectors despite the financial and economic crisis. It also calls for the expansion of military (training) operations and further strengthens EU-NATO cooperation. It encourages the use of development aid (European Development Fund) to finance security operations, supports and encourages further civil-military cooperation and advocates subordination of policy areas under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and fosters the Military Industrial Complex (MIC). It supports and presses for the ATHENA mechanism and use of battle-groups. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject this report because the mutual defence clause (Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union) turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) paves the way for military interventions within the EU. The explicit ‘obligation’ to react ‘by all means’ in case of armed aggression against a Member State goes beyond NATO’s mutual assistance clause since non-armed attacks are also covered. Within the solidarity clause, military support is also demanded in case of terror attacks, natural or man-made disasters, which implies military operations within the EU. Cyber attacks, pandemics and energy shortages can also lead to activation of the solidarity clause. I voted against the report since there is no clear definition of what falls under the solidarity clause and whether social unrest/strikes are also considered ‘man-made disasters’. Furthermore, the report prefers military to civil measures outside and inside the EU, and focuses only on EU defence and military solutions. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject the report because it advocates the militarisation of cyber security and regards the existing civil approach as inadequate, even though the risk is relatively low. It also calls for a deepening of cooperation with NATO and the use of the solidarity clause in the event of an ‘attack’ (in other words, military means will be used in cases of doubt).

 Although the report is based on the correct assumption that climate change can exacerbate existing conflicts, it wrongly focuses on repressive and military counter-measures whilst advocating further EU militarisation. I reject the report because it promotes systematic implementation of military elements into climate policy, financing from the EU budget of military measures linked to climate change, and further closer coordination and cooperation of EU and NATO as well as a special focus on development of military capabilities, pooling and sharing, including the merge of civil and military assets and capabilities. Current conflicts in developing countries can only be solved effectively, also with regard to climate change, if the underlying root causes of global distributive inequity are addressed; the military is the wrong solution.

Mr President, the EU has won the Nobel Peace Prize, and I would not wish to question its achievements, such as its role in reconciliation after the Second World War. However, the reports before us speak a different language. The mutual defence clause, in effect, turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause includes the option of military intervention in Member States in response to man-made disasters. Let me ask the House this: would a Europe-wide general strike constitute such a man-made disaster? Will soldiers from Germany soon be deployed against striking workers in Greece? The implementation of the demands set out in the Annual Report on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would mean a quantum leap in the EU’s military development and an expansion of military intervention worldwide, probably with a robust mandate.  Much of this, including Member States’ obligation to develop their military capabilities, has to do with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Let me say this: the Left in Europe did the right thing by rejecting this Treaty and we will continue their tireless efforts to bring about an amendment of these Treaty provisions. Sabine Lösing,

Madam President, over recent years, the international arms trade has grown further, and the countries of the European Union can once again claim a dubious success: at 34%, they have the leading share of the trade. Many of these exports go to countries with – and I word this carefully – a dubious human rights record, and into conflict areas. That is why there needs to be a complete ban on arms trading, especially in relation to conflict regions. The current negotiations at UN level on an Arms Trade Treaty represent a step in the right direction. We continue to hope that the treaty will not later turn out to be a paper tiger as toothless as previous agreements. For that reason, following a successful conclusion of the treaty, implementation needs to remain on the political agenda consistently. The constructive, cross-group cooperation on the current resolution is a good sign, and one that I am pleased about. It is therefore all the more disappointing that we were unable to avoid the positive reference to the arms industry in paragraph 2 of the resolution. Aside from the moral aspects, I would like to point out that studies have concluded beyond doubt that the influence of military expenditure on jobs is very low in comparison with other public spending. Rather than jobs, it is mostly about ensuring the profits of this branch of industry, the more so given that disarmament and conversion could promote sustainable development, growth and jobs.

 Mr President, ‘yet another war over oil’: that could be the heading for an intervention on the current conflict in Sudan. Once again, the civilian population of both countries are enduring indescribable suffering. All violent attacks and assaults are naturally to be condemned, and naturally we must call for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, that does not absolve us from talking about the causes, or from looking back critically at whether the EU’s clear commitment to the splitting off of South Sudan was responsible given the current circumstances. There will be no quick solution; that much is certain. It is also certain, however, that the problems cannot be resolved by means of armed conflict. Right now, it is essential that we maintain the arms embargo that in fact exists, in order to prevent further escalations. I would like to remind you that in 2004, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Sudan and, in 2011, also to South Sudan, but this was unilaterally relaxed in November 2011 to support security sector reform in South Sudan. However difficult it may be, we need to push for diplomatic negotiations. If the international community wants to help end the conflict, it must do so in the role of a neutral mediator, not led by its own interests. The role that the EU has played has not been neutral. I am very concerned as to whether there will be more such scenarios in future, whether we will see more natural resource-rich regions of Africa splitting off and a spiralling of state disintegration. The foreign policy instrument of state building must not be allowed to be an instrument of such a development. Using access to reserves of natural resources to guide us in our foreign policy activities will bring not peace, but rather death and misery. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, nuclear weapons are among the vilest weapons there are and they should be abolished worldwide. Civil use of nuclear energy is impossible to control. We therefore need to do everything we can to ensure that there is a worldwide move away from nuclear power and towards global nuclear disarmament, and specifically in this case towards a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East – and we must do so in a peaceful way. Until then, the current treaties will apply. As worthy of criticism as the regime in Iran is, it should be noted that, unlike India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It therefore exercises the right to the civil use of nuclear energy guaranteed to all states that have signed this Treaty. That is dangerous – just as it is dangerous in other countries. No one thinks – quite rightly – of taking military action against all the states that have nuclear power plants, or penalising them with sanctions. Neither the secret services nor the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency provide solid evidence that Iran is building, preparing or planning nuclear weapons. Yet blatant threats of war have been made against Iran for many years on precisely this pretext. In addition, there is an increasingly aggressive economic war being waged with the intention of destabilising the country. This policy, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious danger to world peace and limits the opportunities for progressive opposition in Iran. As is so often the case, it seems very much as though peace and human rights are to fall victim to the global interests of the United States and the EU.

 Mr President, today’s discussion takes place against the background of the economic and financial crisis which has deprived many people of their livelihood, their rights and their democracy, and against the background of the thousands of people, in particular children, who are dying of hunger throughout the world. If we are to make savings in Europe, then we should cut our defence spending. Defence means defence against territorial attacks, so it is good that we can say: Yes, we can make savings in this area. However, even if I were to accept the prevailing logic and to assume that our defence requirements are at a very high level, it seems to me that the aim here is to reach a higher level of military capability under the guise of pressure on costs and to give the defence industry a better and more reliable source of income. I think that the scenario of a defence capability under threat is being exaggerated. I would like to mention here that it is not true that cuts in defence spending will lead to a rise in unemployment. That is simply not the case. However, high levels of defence spending do not only involve huge sums of money which are needed elsewhere. The proposals in Mr Lisek’s report also mean putting democracy at risk, for example, by means of the ATHENA mechanism, which is not subject to democratic controls, or by combining civilian and military capabilities. We will be voting against this report. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, have tabled a minority opinion, which calls, among other things, for radical disarmament and a purely civilian EU.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I welcome the excellent cross-party cooperation and majority support for the joint resolution on banning cluster munitions. The resolution constitutes an important and strong signal in the fight against these deadly weapons. We must not forget that cluster munitions and bombs were used in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, and – I would like to remind this Parliament – also by EU Member States. There is no justification for continuing to use these weapons or to store or produce them – none whatsoever – not for defence and not for protecting borders. I urgently call on all Member States not to support the proposed draft text of the new Protocol VI to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. This draft would entail a dramatic step backwards. This draft text prohibits – and this cannot be said clearly enough – cluster munitions and bombs made prior to 1980. That would mean that cluster munitions produced after this date would continue to be permitted and could also continue to be used in future. That is something that we must not accept. The Convention on Cluster Munitions that entered into force in August 2010 prohibits all cluster bombs and munitions, and that must be the benchmark.

− Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a wider scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 I voted against this report as I reject the notion that, if in doubt, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief should be tackled from within the framework of the common security and defence policy (CSDP). What is more, there must not be any mixing of civilian and military activities, something that this report would make possible. I furthermore strongly reject the introduction of security policy elements into the areas of civil protection and humanitarian assistance on the strength of any purported threat of terrorism. I advocate civilian disaster relief independent of security policy concerns and argue for the build-up of the necessary logistical capabilities, which must be independent of the military. Moreover, I would point out that the report refers to the solidarity clause in a positive light, a clause which, for example, also makes military intervention against striking workers possible.

 Mr President, in Israel, too, thousands are demonstrating for social justice and democracy and indicating the connection between their desperate social situation, settlement policy and the huge military expenditure. The policies of those in power in Israel are directed against the Palestinians and also against their own people. The establishment of peace in the region is therefore in the interests of the people of both Israel and Palestine and of world peace – and urgently so. Anyone who does not support the inclusion of Palestine in the United Nations is not doing what is necessary for the security of the people in Israel and Palestine. All forces in Europe must work to obtain a two-state solution, and political decisions must be taken. The recognition of Palestine’s diplomatic representations as embassies in all European States would improve the status of Palestine under international law. All European States must insist that the settlements, which contravene international law, be stopped. Only the equality of the Israeli and the Palestinian people can bring peace and social justice for everyone and marginalise radical forces. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, there is no other policy area where the European Parliament has so few rights of codecision as in the fields of foreign and, especially, of military policy. When it comes to EU military operations, it is the Heads of State or Government alone, meeting in the European Council, who make the decisions. When it comes to the key issue of war and peace, then, the European Parliament has absolutely no right to be heard or even to oversee. There is not even a binding rule that Parliament must be informed before the Union launches a foreign intervention. In light of the establishment of the European External Action Service, which, in practice, has become the executive arm of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), and of the start-up fund for military operations, which has a firm basis in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is a need for more monitoring powers for the national parliaments and for the European Parliament, and for these powers to actually be effective. The resolution on the table does state that the cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament needs to be improved, but there is a definite lack of specific proposals as to how that can be done. The interparliamentary assembly that we have proposed – to be composed of representatives from both national and European level – could pave the way for the resolution or at least attenuation of glaring democratic deficits. Such an interparliamentary assembly need not be composed of all the parties represented in the parliaments in order to ensure real and democratic supervision of European foreign and security policy. It would be nice if our amendments enacting this were to be approved tomorrow. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, in February, many people, including in this House, were full of both hope and concern about the future of Sudan. There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes. It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support. Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again. The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns. I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states. A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however. If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to. Aid for Sudan must be impartial and not tied to any one interest group. It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid. In order to prevent further fuelling of the conflict, all supplying of weapons must be halted. We are calling for an end to all civil/military collaboration and to the military training mission.

 Mr President, in a deeply divided country like Côte d’Ivoire, can a lasting peace be brought about by violent means and can the winner of the presidential election be legitimised? This seems extremely doubtful, especially as the real causes of the conflict have not been resolved. The country was destabilised as a result of economic problems brought about largely by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank. The sanctions which were rapidly imposed with the aim of weakening the Gbagbo government have exacerbated the situation and given rise to a humanitarian crisis in Côte d’Ivoire. The legitimacy of both claimants to the presidency is in dispute. The armies of both sides are responsible for massacring the civilian population. Once again, the West has taken sides and now the United Nations (UN) is waging war alongside French troops to try to ensure the victory of one side in the conflict. Will European powers once again be deciding the fate of African people as they did in colonial times, but this time with the support of the UN? What has happened to the principles of international law? Is this the concept on which the UN was founded? Instead of aiming for peaceful solutions to conflicts, the UN seems to be supporting civil wars or taking sides in them. Whose interest is this in? Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, the Belder report has been considerably improved by the amendments, and my group can agree with a great number of statements. Unfortunately, for all that they are correct, it primarily contains descriptions of the situation, but the underlying philosophy of a realistic future perspective has not been developed. The human rights situation in Iran is intolerable. However, sanctions will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation. In order to promote democratisation in Iran, we must do everything we can to make the international situation less tense. Worsening international relations brings with it the danger that further anti-democratic measures will be taken inside Iran, which will result in weakening the opposition. A policy of detente would also have to put an end to every form of threatening behaviour. Negotiations and international relations can only be successful if diplomatic recognition of all partners is a given. Only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved. I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution, and on the grounds that I have described, I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected.

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, will the situation now improve for the people in Southern Sudan or is the split more in the interests of the West so that we can get control of the oil reserves? In any case, the South has huge challenges ahead. Without a functional infrastructure and with the current disastrous economic situation, civilian assistance and humanitarian aid will be needed for a long time. Unfortunately, the danger of violent conflicts has probably not been eliminated for certain. However, experts believe that this cannot be resolved by military means. On the contrary, a focus on military means prevents a real solution to the conflicts being found. The necessary civilian assistance can be provided much more efficiently without military involvement. The transfer of civilian tasks to the military hinders the sustainable development of civilian structures. An example of this is Darfur. A massive military apparatus has now taken over the tasks of humanitarian and development organisations there, something that has been sharply criticised by these organisations. Our demands are that the focus be on purely civilian conflict management and assistance measures, in other words a reduction of the UN mission to the civilian components and no potential use of EU battle groups. In addition, in terms of a development perspective we call for Sudan’s debt be written off. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, many thanks to Mr Gahler for his report. It is clear, also from this report, that there is enormous interest in the natural resources of the Arctic region. As a result of climate change, oil and gas and other resources can be extracted increasingly easily. The issue of making better use of shipping routes has already been discussed. The logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region. Industrial development – in particular, through the extraction of oil and gas, the expansion of commercial fishing and increased shipping traffic – will all necessarily lead to the disturbance, or perhaps even destruction, of this highly sensitive ecosystem, with devastating consequences. Unfortunately, this report deals in generalities and does not contain any effective strategies for combating these dangers. A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic. The bordering states of Russia and NATO members USA, Canada, Denmark and Norway have already begun militarising the Arctic region and intend to protect their interests there. Climate change has led to this situation in the Arctic. We need to prevent the catastrophic progress of this change, something that can only be achieved through a rapid changeover to renewable energy sources. However, this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot. In common with numerous environmental organisations, we are calling for a moratorium on new oil extraction projects in the Arctic. A treaty needs to be agreed – similar to the Treaty on the Antarctic – that prohibits the extraction of mineral resources in the region. Last but not least, we are calling for the immediate demilitarisation of the region and therefore for the establishment of the Arctic as a demilitarised zone. Because my group and I are unable to support the results of the own-initiative report presented here, the GUE/NGL has submitted an alternative report.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of that and, of course, it is not possible to impose this from above. The question remains, however: Who was consulted? Which states are involved? Which indigenous peoples are affected? Was there any consultation with the people who may benefit from the situation, or with those who may lose their livelihood? I think that further dialogue is needed. The talks held so far are not enough. We need to try to keep this dialogue as broad as possible, also consulting with wider sections of society, possibly including the indigenous peoples in particular. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, what is this all about? Is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism? This is an important question when it comes to assessing the situation. Experts on this region are of the opinion that this is more to do with crime than with religiously motivated international terrorism. Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests. It may be that this is also about Africa as one of the areas in which Europe is interested. In the words of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, it concerns Africa as Europe’s backyard. I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa. The Sahel region can only be made secure by improving the situation of the population. Increasing security and military budgets in countries where the population is suffering from an acute food shortage is a disastrous move. Finally, I would like you to consider the fact that kidnapping and other crimes are a business in which many people are involved in a confusing array of organisations. Western funding for security structures could have a counterproductive effect on efforts to combat crime and could continue putting innocent people at risk in future.

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences. However, women’s rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions. The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women’s rights. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true. The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war. The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations. Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare. I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence.

 I absolutely agree with and support the tabled amendments, especially the ones on the delegated acts and restoring the European Parliament's right of scrutiny. But I abstained on the final vote on the Instrument (DCI) itself as, directly or indirectly, the African Peace Facility was funded through this instrument, and this funding was used inter alia for police and army training missions. I am of the opinion that development funding must not be used for any military or civil-military purposes. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, it is important to make clear at this point that, when it comes to the EU’s foreign policy financing instruments, the Treaty of Lisbon abolished the European Parliament’s right of supervision. In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service. I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union’s far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation. We support Parliament’s cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments. Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier. All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy.

 I condemn the mass rapes and serious violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the strongest possible terms. I very much welcome the inclusion and adoption of this condemnation in the joint motion for a resolution. I voted against the joint motion for a resolution, however, because, to a large extent, Congolese military and police units trained by the EU’s EUPOL and EUSEC missions since 2005 were, and are, also involved in these crimes. The joint motion for a resolution expressly supports and welcomes these training missions. I am in favour of the immediate cessation of these missions, as they have contributed in a negative way to the escalation of violence and to the situation in the country by training security forces that have been repeatedly involved in the serious violations of the human rights of the Congolese people. In addition, the army and police trained by the EU support the repressive apparatus of the corrupt Kabila regime. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in 2000, the European Union clearly stated in the Lisbon strategy its objective of becoming the leading economic power in the world by 2010. We have failed to meet this target in many areas, but not as far as arms exports from the EU are concerned. In the period from 2005 to 2009, the EU Member States overtook the United States and became the world’s leading arms exporters. I think that this development is highly questionable. Obviously, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was never legally binding and which included a restrictive export licensing practice, consisted of empty words. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was converted into a common position in December 2008. However, we still have no effective sanction mechanisms. For example, long before 2008, Germany recognised the Code of Conduct as being legally binding. Despite this, Germany is now the third largest arms exporter in the world and supplies arms to crisis regions such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In addition, the arms export reports which the Member States submit to the Council are not uniform and often not transparent. We urgently need standardisation in this area, so that all the relevant arms exports are traceable and can be subjected to critical evaluation. Unfortunately, almost no efforts are being made to standardise these reports. In any case, I doubt whether it is possible to have a system of ethically sound arms exports. However, one thing is certain and that is that the European Union is currently a very long way from achieving this.

Madam President, I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions, which I expressly support. As already explained, cluster munitions are indeed among the most brutal weapons in existence. They were certainly still in use by some EU Member States and the USA until recently. I could mention the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. It is quite shocking that – as has already been stated – statistically, the victims of cluster bombs and cluster munitions are 98% civilians, 27% of whom are children. How are we to view the prospects for the continued use of these weapons? It is certainly remarkable that Deutsche Bank is investing in the production of these dreadful weapons through its subsidiaries. It has been proven that business relations exist between Deutsche Bank and leading suppliers and manufacturers of cluster munitions, including L-3 Communications and Lockheed Martin. I find it shameless and inhumane to knowingly seek to make money from the death of civilians. The use, production, storage and transport of these weapons must be prohibited; the same goes for the trade in such weapons. For this reason, all EU Member States, along with all other countries, must sign and ratify the agreement on cluster munitions in full by August of this year or, if this is not possible, as Mr Gahler has stated, they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity. There should also be a moratorium on the use, production and distribution of cluster munitions until the agreement is ratified and work should begin as quickly as possible to destroy the existing stockpiles of cluster munitions. I am very pleased with this cross-party cooperation and support for the agreement on cluster munitions in the form of this joint resolution and welcome it on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. We believe that this resolution represents a major success in the fight against these murderous weapons. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to make clear at this point that we are deeply concerned about the development of EU foreign policy towards militarisation and an increasingly interventionist policy. That is a dangerous development. I want to say, in all clarity, that we believe that a military approach to conflict resolution or to the supposed stabilisation of countries or regions is absolutely the wrong way to go to achieve greater security for the EU and the world. Military interventions – and Afghanistan, unfortunately, is a very current example of this – bring suffering, death and prolonged devastation, but no peace and no improvement in the situation as far as the resident population is concerned. The Danjean report lists what are referred to as key threats that constitute a challenge for the EU’s future security policy. One of these is climate change – something that has been overwhelmingly caused by the industrialised nations of the West. If people in the countries of the South have to take flight because they no longer have any water and food becomes scarcer and scarcer, they will represent a security problem for Europe. Such a view is cynical and inhuman. If States collapse as a result of neoliberal economic policy, they will constitute a security problem. What we need is not more military, it is a change, an end to the European Union’s neoliberal orientation. The European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the creation of a crisis management and planning directorate and the planned start-up fund to fund military operations are designed to make the EU a global player in military terms. We believe that moves towards centralisation in the European External Action Service are a dangerous and undemocratic development. The EU should assume a leading role in relation to demilitarisation and disarmament, especially in the field of nuclear disarmament. There needs to be a push for the obligation incumbent upon nuclear States under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which is to say, complete nuclear disarmament, to be honoured at long last. This was a key promise that constituted the basis on which many States signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and have, as a result, durably refrained from acquiring nuclear weapons. Reliable guarantees of non-aggression are the best means of preventing proliferation as, otherwise, countries threatened with intervention will attempt to deter such an attack by means of acquiring nuclear weapons. If nothing else, I would like, in this context, and in particular with regard to Iran, to point out and to warn that military operations or military activities of any kind to prevent proliferation are completely counter-productive and highly dangerous. We will be rejecting the Danjean report and have tabled our own resolution on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– I am fully aware that international nuclear disarmament, and therefore the strengthening of the NPT and its ratification by all states, are of vital importance and that every effort should be made to implement the treaty in all its aspects. To ensure effective multilateral efforts, they must be set within a well-developed vision of achieving a nuclear weapon-free world at the earliest date possible. We must insist on the commitment of the nuclear weapons states under Article VI of the NPT to disarm completely, as it was a key promise and so many countries have signed the NPT and thus forego nuclear weapons permanently. We oppose the phrase in this joint resolution (Recital G): ‘... making use of all instruments at its disposal to prevent ...’. I warn, in particular regarding Iran, that any military activity to prevent proliferation is completely counterproductive and highly dangerous. I am convinced that the best way to deal with the problem of proliferation would be to abandon atomic energy once and for all, as its civilian use bears great dangers on its own and, moreover, it cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty that civilian nuclear technology will not be used for military purposes.

 Mr President, we believe that the item on Madagascar is not particularly important today. We would therefore ask that that time slot be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Afro-American journalist who was found guilty of murdering a policeman in 1982, following a trial based on circumstantial evidence. Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years. Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated. In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know. Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January. The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever. We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.

Madam President, the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror. At this point in time, however, the strategic options for the US and the Member States of the EU in Yemen and the Horn of Africa region are not really open. The fact is that the ruling elites surrounding President Saleh brutally discriminate against and suppress the Shi’ite population in the north of the country and are waging a war against the separatist movement in the south, in the area of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, that is causing a great deal of suffering to the population there. There is no real provable connection to speak of between the Shi’ite population and al-Qaeda and this idea thus merely serves the corrupt and de facto
 autocratic government as a smoke-screen behind which to obtain massive military aid. Supporting this government to build up security forces should be avoided – doing so merely pours further oil on the fire. Any aid provided must benefit all the regions, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political orientation. A reconciliation process including the UN and all local players, including in the neighbouring states – such as Iran – must be initiated and promoted. We must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebels. Operation Atalanta should not be continued and expanded, and absolutely not onto the territory of the Yemeni mainland, because this would only serve the geostrategic interests of Western industrialised nations. We should focus all our efforts on ensuring that the EU does not go along with the US’s completely erroneous strategy of escalation in Yemen, too. Sabine Lösing,

As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended. Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children? The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled – atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved. So what is being defended in the Congo? Humanity? Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people? President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms. This change was suspended when the war escalated once again. My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo – the FDLR – reputed to be in Germany? I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– On 9 November 2009, the report on the request for the defence of the immunity and privileges of Tobias Pflüger (A7-0054/2009
) was voted and adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) in the European Parliament. This report is based on incorrect facts. The central point is that the report cites a judgment at first instance which has been repealed. The judgment is invalid, because the regional court in Munich http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=dismiss" ed http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=an" http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=action"  against Tobias Pflüger on 21 July 2009 in the second and final instance. A conviction was not made. For this reason, all reproaches are invalid. It is politically unacceptable that this report, which contains incorrect facts, was voted in Plenary today (24 November 2009). We have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken from the agenda, unfortunately without success. This kind of proceeding by the European Parliament creates the impression of supporting the persecution of politically active persons, in this case, the Munich II Public Prosecution Service against a former Member of the European Parliament.

Madam President, thank you for the report. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I questioned the competent representative of the Commission in a debate on the role of this agreement within the framework of EU immigration management. He clearly stated that, when it entered into force, it would pave the way for cooperation with the border security agency (Frontex) and for numerous immigration regulations, such as within the framework of readmission agreements and border security with Afghanistan. The 1 200 km long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has already been addressed here. It will then also become another target of the EU’s repressive policy to keep out refugees. Thus, the European Union wants to seal itself off from refugees far beyond its external borders. Yet again, we see that this is a fundamental component of EU foreign policy. As a result of such partnership agreements, refugees are interned in camps, in which, as we all know, inhumane conditions prevail, as is currently the case in Ukraine. The problem has already been addressed here in general terms. This form of so-called international immigration management involves serious infringement of the Geneva Refugee Convention and of international human rights. I therefore call on the EU to start fighting the cause of flight rather than the refugees. The European neighbourhood policy is one means of making fortress Europe even more impenetrable, which is why it is looked on very sceptically from our point of view, from the point of view of the GUE/NGL.

 Mr President, I think that this conflict is very often presented in a very one-sided manner. I agree with the previous speaker that in the present case it is frequently a matter of attacks on Han Chinese by Uighurs and indeed that some of these attacks are racially motivated. (Heckling)
 I read an interview with a Uighur woman, for example, who said: Would you like to be governed by yellow communists? The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region, for example they are allowed to have more children, they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples. Many of the local Han Chinese are also envious of them. We ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects. Sometimes problems do not lie where they seem to at first glance. We should be careful not to take a one-sided position. We ought to support the Chinese in solving their problems. The one-sided view that is so often presented in this House is, in my opinion, dangerous. The Chinese Government certainly has shortcomings in its policy towards minority groups and it has its failures too. However, it is also showing the will to improve in many areas. We should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation – and indeed also critical cooperation – based on trust. Sabine Wils,

Mr President, the most recent climate conferences have not produced any substantive improvements. The survival of the small island states and the least developed countries is still at risk from climate change. In Doha, the Green Climate Fund agreed in 2010 must be established, and a decision is also needed on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of 2012.  According to the World Bank, the global South needs USD 100 billion annually from 2014 to support adaptation to the impacts of climate change. It is clear that the industrialised countries must take responsibility for providing this funding. As long as the industrialised and emerging countries are at odds with each other and deploy blockading tactics, Doha will not produce any positive outcomes for the global climate. Climate protection must start at the national level and, in our case, at the European level as well.  The EU must increase its greenhouse reduction target for 2020 to 40 % against the 1990 baseline and make a firm and binding commitment to increase the share of renewables to 45 % by 2030.

Mr President, since it became clear that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy would each be preparing an own-initiative report, Parliament has been overrun by industry lobbyists. A whole string of shale gas events has been held since then here in this House, month after month, by the gas production companies – and with the active support of both conservative and liberal Members. There was only a single event here that was not organised by the disciples of fracking among us. This dominance of one-sided lobbying by financially powerful corporations should give us food for thought. It is unacceptable.  This perversion is particularly apparent when it comes to the subject of fracking. Companies want to protect their income; risks are played down and swept aside. Accidents are ruled out. Apparently we need shale gas for the energy transition. We are told the impact on the landscape will also be minimal, and so on. No, all this cannot hide the fact that fracking involves incalculable risks, is superfluous and only serves the profit interests of a small number of gas monopolists. I therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 4, in which the Member States are called upon not to approve any more fracking activities.

Mr President, I believe these lobbyists are holding this event to influence us MEPs. This event outside Parliament today, before tomorrow’s vote, is particularly blatant. I think that most people will also be unable to escape the arguments being made there, as they are supposedly objective arguments. Nevertheless, I do not wish to imply that of anyone. I find it striking, however, that the industry thinks it can make an impression here with its arguments. Yet certain statements that we are hearing are actually influenced by them. That is why I do not think it a good thing that we are allowed to be overrun by lobbyists in such a way here in Parliament. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Krahmer, to my mind an open debate involves a podium discussion to which both sides are invited, where opponents and advocates of fracking are both given the opportunity to speak. The majority of events that have been held here in Parliament, however, were not of this nature. As I said, just one event against fracking was held, involving a non-governmental organisation from the United States. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)).

Mr President, I do not think an exhibition can influence your opinion, any more than a conversation with a non-governmental organisation can change my opinion. Nevertheless, I do not consider it right that it is possible now, before this vote takes place in Parliament, for these lobbyists to be there right outside our door and go ahead with this event, which has already been touched upon several times here.

 Mr President, it is time to put an end once and for all to the fact that, every year, tens of thousands of people in the EU die prematurely because of marine emissions. Outside the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), ships’ engines are more or less burning special waste. On this, the EU is lagging far behind the US and Canada, where only low sulphur fuel can be used in coastal areas. As far as I am concerned, this proposal to amend the directive represents a clear improvement, and this is partly down to the tenacity of the rapporteur. Better limit values are only half the battle, however. Equally as important is the fact that these are then implemented and enforced. There are certain loopholes, as a result of which it cannot be ruled out that shipowners will be able to evade the directive if, for example, a shipowner apparently proves that he is unable to store low sulphur fuels. It really comes down to the Member States and the Commission here. They must implement the regulations and impose painful penalties when necessary. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, in relation to the recast version of the first railway package, all the groups except my own appear to believe that more competition in the railway sector could be beneficial to citizens. In fact, the very opposite is the case. Or is all this perhaps really about securing profits for those private companies involved in the railway sector and bringing about a quick break-up and privatisation of what have, up to now, been national railways such as SNCF and Deutsche Bahn
? Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom, for example, shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy of liberalisation will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. The railway sector should not lose its economic, social and environmental role for the future, and therefore must not be broken up into individual free-market radical, profit-focused parts. My group is therefore on the side of the trade unions and clearly in favour of the idea of retaining integrated railway companies, which have crucial experience and skills, in public hands. These companies not only provide social security for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased volumes of rail traffic in future. In the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the majority from the other groups essentially followed the Commission proposal for a further liberalisation and privatisation of the railway sector. It remains unclear what competences the national rail supervisory authorities and the new EU regulatory body would each have in relation to safety matters. In any case, the safety of rail traffic must be prioritised above the supervision of competition rules. In Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the idea was always in the background that the fourth railway package would also herald the separation of networks and operators. This, too, is something that my group will resolutely oppose. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the fundamental tenor of the Commission’s proposal and of the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in relation to the Energy Taxation Directive would facilitate the uniform handling of all sources of energy by 2023 by following a technically neutral approach with a minimum tax rate for all traded fuels and electricity, based on CO2
 and energy content. At the same time, incentives would be established for the use of less polluting energy products for the transition to a low carbon economy. The proposed directive would provide three important tax incentives: firstly, for the reduction of CO2
 emissions, secondly, for the saving of energy, and thirdly, for the promotion of a changeover to more energy-efficient fuels and more environmentally sound energy production. The adjustment for diesel fuel to bring it into line with the taxation of petrol could place pressure on the motor industry to develop more energy-efficient engines. In the United Kingdom, both fuels are already taxed to the same level. The EU’s objective of minimum taxation establishes equal conditions for all. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the current vote on the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050 is of central importance. The lack of ambition in relation to European climate protection policy threatens the sustainable development of Europe’s economy. Dirty technologies, such as nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, are impeding a change in energy policy. The EU emissions trading system has so far failed as an instrument for climate protection and is undermining European climate protection policy. It shows that market-based instruments are not the way to combat climate change. Long-term climate protection means identifying binding targets for renewable energies and for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Binding interim steps for 2030 and 2040 as part of the move away from the use of carbon in economic activity by 2050 will give industry some certainty in relation to planning. Ambitious climate protection with a long-term goal of 95% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels will promote innovation and create new jobs in the area of renewable technologies.

 Mr President, the Member States and the industrialised nations have been living beyond their means for many years. It is nothing new when I tell you that we can only enjoy a lifestyle like this at the expense of the poorer countries of the world. The WEEE Directive addresses at least part of the problem. The open area of application is of decisive importance. This approach can and should set an example in terms of environmental legislation. I am pleased that a collection target of 85% has been set, particularly because the Council held out stubbornly for lower targets for a long time. I constantly find myself saying: Parliament needs to flex its muscles. After all, people will only invest in environmentally-friendly technologies and innovation will only be encouraged if legislators speed up their work. With this in mind, I also welcome the fact that solar modules are not to be excluded from the directive. It was right not to rely on a voluntary, self-imposed commitment by the manufacturers. All too often in the past, Parliament has bowed to pressure and given in to such deals. These deals have also often proven to be just another way for the industry to drag its heels. Nonetheless, I do not agree with the way the directive deals with nanomaterials. It is essential that waste equipment containing nanomaterials should be dealt with separately. The report simply invites the Commission to investigate whether this is to continue to happen in the future, however. This is an extraordinarily weak formulation that is not worth a great deal. Nanomaterials can be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear indicators stating that they are damaging to health. I am therefore calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. Overall, however, I am satisfied with the results in this context. The perseverance of Parliament in its negotiations with the Council has paid off. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for this. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the obvious point of the new version of the first railway package is to secure profits for private businesses in the rail sector. The integrated public railway companies are to be destroyed by allowing subcontracts to be awarded and marshalling yards and maintenance works to be privatised and operated by private businesses from outside the railway industry. Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. I strongly oppose the suggestion from the Right in Parliament, contrary to the majority opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that the right to strike should be removed by invoking the vital services principle. The railway sector is an integrated network that cannot be divided up into radical free-market, profit-oriented parts. We must not allow this to happen because it must remain possible to control the railway sector in a social, economic and ecological context into the future. It is for this reason that my group sides with the unions and clearly favours the retention of the integrated railway companies in public hands. These companies not only provide social stability for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased transport volumes. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, I am outraged. The stress tests for nuclear power plants in the EU give the operators an alibi to continue running their reactors and are intended to conceal the actual danger represented by the so-called residual risks, in particular, if the power plants do not have to be shut down when the results of the stress tests are negative. The failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures. Radioactive radiation does not stop at national borders. In order to protect the people of Europe and its neighbouring countries, the EU should develop a Europe-wide exit strategy, call on its neighbours to get out of nuclear power as part of its neighbourhood policy and, in this way, prevent new nuclear power stations from being built. The prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the Euratom Treaty, which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry. In the past, loans of more than EUR 500 million have been made available to Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine alone for the construction of new nuclear power stations. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the EHEC epidemic is making apparent the flaws in the system of industrial food production in the liberalised Internal Market of the EU. When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers. So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection. In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders. After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear. If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited. As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food. However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety. Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from. The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic. In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside. The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation. We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy. Our food must be safe. However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks. The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, following the disaster of Chernobyl 25 years ago, new investigations by the Society for Radiation Protection show that to date 1.4 million people have died from the long-term consequences of the nuclear meltdown. Even in Germany we feared for the safety of our children, as they were exposed to radioactive rain clouds and contaminated foodstuffs. The EU must now take the right steps in responding to the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. The fears that the promised stress tests for all nuclear power plants would simply provide an excuse for the continued operation of reactors have unfortunately proven to be well-founded in the light of the stress criteria announced. Other nuclear facilities will not be examined. Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population. We are calling for extensive, binding stress tests carried out by independent experts. However this can only be the first step on the way to a Europe-wide nuclear exit scenario. Sabine Wils

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal waste exports and the illegal disposal of waste pose an increasing threat to the health and environment of millions of people in developing countries. The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU. Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs. I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue. The legal loopholes that permit these hazardous exports must be closed. The existing regulations on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced. We need a legislative proposal for environmental inspections, something that Parliament already called for in 2008, so that ships can be inspected effectively by the authorities in the local ports. This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law. We propose that this should be reinforced in a joint resolution by all sides of the House. The entry of waste into the EU must also be better controlled. Off the coast of Calabria, just a few miles away from the port of Cetraro, there is a sunken vessel known for carrying highly toxic waste. It is assumed that many other toxic waste transporters have been sunk just off the coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea. This example illustrates the need for transparency in the shipment of waste and for reliable official inspections. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, there have recently been demonstrations in Germany in which 250 000 people called for an immediate exit from nuclear power and a changeover to 100% renewable energy. Both of these things are possible. After Chernobyl and Fukushima, it is clear that nuclear power will always involve a residual risk. Therefore, it must be mandatory for the nuclear safety standards throughout Europe to be based on the best available technologies. Despite the adoption of the Council Directive concerning the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009, the existing safety standards remain in place in the Member States. Therefore, we urgently need a revision of this directive with the involvement of Parliament under the codecision procedure which is not based on the Euratom Treaty. I want to see an initiative involving as many of the groups in Parliament as possible which will call on the Council and the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to this effect. I believe that we need a nuclear exit scenario covering the whole of Europe. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown. Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically. This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power. That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price. For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance. Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States. The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty. Billions in taxpayers’ money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin discussing light commercial vehicles, I would like to remind you that European car manufacturers have achieved the EU’s CO2
 product targets for cars several years before the deadline in 2015, by taking the appropriate technical measures. It is now clear that the manufacturers were seriously exaggerating during the negotiations on the time period and the targets for the CO2
 reduction measures for cars when these were subsequently watered down. The manufacturers have taken the same approach in their lobbying activities concerning the CO2
 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles. I would like to know how a majority here in Parliament can knowingly repeat this mistake and give in once again to the demands of the automotive industry. In this era of climate change, I believe that the important issues are protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the human race. If Parliament would at least support the Commission’s proposal, this would put the European automotive industry at the cutting edge of technical development and, therefore, allow it to remain competitive. The Commission proposed a reduction target of 135 grams of CO2
 per kilometre. Following a transition period, the manufacturers would not be required to reach this limit until 2020. In my opinion, that would have been feasible. Instead of this, under pressure from the Council, a poor compromise was reached behind closed doors, according to which car manufacturers must now reduce the CO2
 emissions of light commercial vehicles to only 197 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. This feeble compromise is a gift to the industry. Super-credits, phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further. Lobbying by manufacturers among Members of this House and pressure from the vehicle manufacturing countries, namely Germany, France and Italy, in the Council have produced this poor result, which contains a whole series of loopholes. This report is unacceptable. It conflicts with the climate objectives of the EU and will slow down the pace of technical innovation. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will be voting against this report. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically. Millions of tonnes of electric and electronic waste are produced in the EU every year and this represents a genuine hazard for people and the environment. I am pleased that the report by Mr Florenz recognises this problem and that we were able to introduce some pleasing improvements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which had the support of all the groups. The stricter export regulations for electric and electronic waste are important. I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected. However, I still do not agree with the exclusion of solar modules from the directive. I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers. A few manufacturers use cadmium, which is a toxic substance, in their solar modules. The fact that modules are frequently removed by do-it-yourself enthusiasts presents an additional risk. Nanomaterials can also be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear instructions stating that they are damaging to health. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. This is why we have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I would like to ask you to support them. These are Amendments 101 and 102.

 Mr President, the draft directive on patient mobility could quickly lead to healthcare in the EU being reduced to the level of the lowest common denominator, by means of a service-based approach. My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers. The proposed directive will enable health insurance companies to send patients abroad for cheaper treatment. This will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector. If a specific treatment is available more cheaply a few hundred kilometres away, and if patients are sent there by their insurance companies, the result will be that this particular treatment will no longer be available locally. Therefore, the health sector will simply be following the neoliberal logic of the market, instead of giving priority to patients’ welfare. I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to see health tourism in this sensitive sector. I am in favour of patients receiving healthcare close to where they live. This is a public responsibility as part of the provision of services of general interest, which must be available for everyone in their local area. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, grinding, mixing, cheating – these are the three buzzwords of the feed industry in Germany. Since 1999, there have been five dioxin scandals in Germany alone. Feed manufacturers and large food companies are clearly not concerned about EU directives and national legislation when it comes to making large profits with cheap food. Competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in Germany. Feed for intensive livestock farming is therefore intended to be as cheap as possible. State checks are rarely carried out on feed and food producers. The state has increasingly relied on self checking by the manufacturer and saved itself the expense of employing qualified staff. Under these conditions, technical fat waste contaminated with dioxins was able to find its way into the feed and foodstuffs chain. The current dioxin scandal could have been prevented if the fat had been tested for dioxins before it was mixed into the feed. The contamination would then have been detected in time. Numerous consumers have now been contaminated with additional dioxins once again. Eighty percent of our intake of dioxins enters our bodies via foodstuffs of animal origin – in other words, meat, milk and eggs. Foodwatch is rightly demanding that feed manufacturers be placed under obligation to test every batch of feed ingredients for dioxins and PCBs before they mix the feed. Absolutely no ingredients that do not comply with the limit values may be included in the feed. Highly contaminated batches must be destroyed, and it must be possible to prove that this has indeed been done. That is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminants. Laboratories must also be placed under obligation to report cases where the limit values are exceeded to the national supervisory authorities. We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability. The current and previous food scandals in Germany have shown that routine state checks on the feed manufacturers and animal producers are essential. How do you intend to implement that Commissioner?

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the climate conference in Cancún must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation. As part of an alliance of responsibility, the EU must demonstrate political leadership, regardless of what the United States does, and allow itself to be judged by the principle of climate justice. This means that there must be a second commitment period for the industrialised nations under the Kyoto Protocol. Additional funds must be provided for financing climate measures. With regard to long-term financing, the EU must lay its cards on the table in the negotiations. The EU must present ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases. The global temperature must under no circumstances increase by more than 1.5°C. This target will result in technical innovations and create jobs at a time of economic crisis. Sabine Wils,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a good job and salvaged what was possible in the face of great resistance from the Council and the majority here in Parliament. One major success of the new version is the open scope. This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it. On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC. Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force. Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs. We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly. Leading manufacturers are showing us the way. Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times. It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result. After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them. The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union. Sabine Wils,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, biocides form part of many cleaning products, disinfectants, insect sprays and other everyday products which people come into contact with in the course of their daily lives. There are currently more than 50 000 biocide products in the European Union. I would like to make it perfectly clear to everyone that biocides are mainly used by private citizens. Biocides are often non-biodegradable, in some cases, carcinogenic, highly toxic substances, and can cause harm to people, animals and the environment when they are being used and disposed of. People and young children in particular are especially at risk when biocides are used in the home, for example, in the form of wood preservatives and insect sprays. It is true that the manufacturers say that their products are not hazardous if they are used properly. However, given that 400 000 tonnes of biocides are sold to and used by private individuals in the EU every year, it is important that improper use and the occurrence of accidents are taken into consideration. As this has not yet been the case, I have tabled an amendment on this subject and I would ask you vote in favour of it. This is Amendment 352. Should the purpose of this regulation be to increase the free circulation of biocidal products within the European Union as the Commission has proposed? Or is this House more concerned with protecting people and the environment? It is essential that we introduce a strict ban on particularly hazardous substances. We must make a decision which supports the cause of consumers, otherwise we will be putting people’s health at risk. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, two phases of postal service liberalisation have already been implemented. The Commission has not, as yet, published a single study dealing solely with social conditions and the impact on postal workers of the opening up of the market. My question to you, Commissioner Barnier, is when will this study be made available to Parliament at long last? Yesterday, we heard from numerous postal workers from several EU Member States that entire workforces are already being dismissed by the new postal companies and re-employed under poorer conditions. Competition and competition policy must not be played out at the expense of the workers. If the Commission and Parliament really want to do something to combat poverty and exclusion in the EU, the third phase of the postal service liberalisation must now be discontinued. The consequences for postal workers and the quality of the universal service must first be investigated. We therefore call for a moratorium on the third phase of postal service liberalisation for the sake of customers and postal workers. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Unfortunately, the joint resolution’s recitals contain a positive reference to the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which I and my group reject. But due to the very high importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries I and the GUE/NGL group signed the joint resolution on the entry into force of the CCM and the role of the EU, as this joint resolution must be seen as a great success in order to ban cluster munitions.

– I welcome the motion for a resolution on the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Kampala, Uganda, as it contains very crucial and important points and requests regarding the ratification and the implementation of the ICC. Therefore, I voted in favour. But I want to express my deep concerns about certain phrases in the resolution, which refer positively to the ‘Stockholm Programme’, the ‘EIDHR’ and to the European Union as a ‘Global Player’. In this matter, the ‘Stockholm Programme’ and the ‘EIDHR’ might have had a positive impact, but in many other areas, these two programmes/instruments are not used in a democratic and transparent manner. The European Union has indeed been acting as a ‘Global Player’ but, in my view, not at all in a positive way towards a more fair and solidary world order. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the United Nations climate conference failed due to the hard-nosed political interests of the industrialised nations. As a result, the basis for existence of billions of people in developing countries and in the island nations at risk of being submerged is in jeopardy. There is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet. The EU played the game in the interests of its national undertakings and the profits of the large concerns. The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States by a total of 30% by 2020 was not brought to the table early enough. Making better climate protection targets dependent on the prior concessions of other States is playing dice with the future of humanity. The facts are clear: in 2007, CO2
 emissions per person were 4.6 tonnes in China, in Germany they were 9.7 tonnes and in the US 19.1 tonnes. We urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity. Next year in Mexico City, the industrialised nations and emerging economies must come to a binding agreement with specific and ambitious targets. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in many parts of the world the consequences of climate change are visible. The most recent calculations assume a global temperature rise of up to 4° C by 2060, and up to 10° C in the Arctic. It is primarily Europe’s soot emissions that are responsible for the significantly faster melting of the ice in the Arctic – they are borne there by the wind. The rich industrial States of the EU are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change. USD 100 billion will be needed every year from 2010 to 2050. Of that amount, it is fair to say that USD 30 billion is not too much for the European Union. The transfer of technology must also not be linked to patents, or else some of the money will simply be flowing straight back to the corporations in the industrialised countries. The EU has an obligation to take a lead at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy. When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care. How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half? How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester? I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs. On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece. I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what should worry us and make us panic is not simply the sheer numbers of unemployed young people in Europe, but the way this is developing. Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation. It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living. If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities. I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity. When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis. In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe’s economy. We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies. That would be the right approach. Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people. I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70. We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market. That is what I am urgently calling for. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speculation was a major factor in triggering the crisis, while credit default swaps (CDSs) and short selling have been a major factor in heightening the crisis. These instruments have degenerated into purely speculative instruments. Some people in the financial sector seem to have incorrectly regarded or misused these instruments as a personal licence to print money. As a result, entire economies have suffered, along with nation states and, above all, the people of the countries concerned. To this extent, the fact that the Commission has finally taken the initiative and realised that regulation is necessary is to be welcomed. Whether or not the regulation will be strict remains to be seen. I expressly welcome the work and the efforts by the rapporteur, Mr Canfin, to improve the regulation tabled and to put a stop to the gambling. What is needed is a de facto
 ban on naked short selling and the prevention of speculation in the future. We also need strict regulation and, above all, a strong supervisory authority in Europe. I fear, however, that as the negotiations continue, the interests of the financial centres – London and Frankfurt in particular – will override the interests of the majority of the people of Europe. If that happens we will be left with little more than a Swiss cheese in which the holes are probably larger than what is left. That is quite definitely not something my group could support.

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint. It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do. On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation. Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households. This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers. Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission. The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers. For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support. I would like to comment on four points. Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention. If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place. Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area. Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights. Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector. I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions. This is a good thing. We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, public procurement law and the awarding of public contracts are an essential part of the internal market. Mr Barnier, my response to your remarks about wanting to promote social integration in this context is that I have heard very little about protecting social rights or about protecting collective agreements. These are some of the fundamental rules which you, as you have said, do not want to call into question. If we want to protect the fundamental rules, we must ensure in future, during the process of awarding public contracts, that basic social standards are maintained, that collective agreements are not undermined, and that the use of cheap labour is prevented. All of this forms part of modern public procurement law. I would like to make it clear that we must no longer put greater emphasis on economic freedoms and free competition than on fundamental social rights. Either we want a social Europe or we want permanent conflict with the people who are turning away from Europe because it does not protect their interests. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too. Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity. I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prosperity of a country is created through the work of its people. In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid. People want proper, secure pensions in their old age. One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable. In contrast, occupational and private pension funds have lost millions of euro on the stock exchange. It is ridiculous to increase the focus on private, capital-based pension systems when providing for people’s retirement. The public has financed the rescue packages for the major banks. The people are paying for a tough austerity policy which is under the control of the European Union. Now, they are supposed to turn around national budgets by taking cuts in their pensions and accepting a higher retirement age. Previous pension reforms are already leading to increasing poverty in old age. The only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension systems. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition. However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider. In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition. The report sets down pointers for the Commission’s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe. Thomas Händel,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs. That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family. The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain. Women, in particular, have been affected by this. The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women. Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions. Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation. Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘good work’ principles. All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers. The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal for integrated guidelines for more and better jobs has been significantly improved by the work of Parliament. Despite a number of improvements, we are still a long way from achieving our goals. We do not deny the fact that improvements have been made with regard to the equality of men and women, but it would have been better to integrate a separate guideline into this set of guidelines. We will request this very forcefully in plenary tomorrow. Secondly, it is important that the evaluation of the results and the reporting obligations are firmly established within Parliament’s sphere of competence and that there are now more exacting objectives and sub-goals with regard to labour market participation and active labour market policy in the report. However, it would be important for Parliament to confirm tomorrow that the ILO principles relating to good and decent work as well as the question of a minimum income that is clearly above the poverty line are taken into consideration in the report. I am, however, of the opinion that this report still has a number of shortcomings. It is far too reminiscent of the old Lisbon strategy. The failed flexicurity principles have been repeated like a mantra and much of the wording smacks of the old deregulation policy. Secondly, if principles such as the compatibility of work and family life, social cohesion, sustainable economic management, investments and education are mentioned but there are no specific measures to follow this, it represents a weakness in the report. For more and better employment, it would be necessary to place the focus on reducing the precariousness of the current situation and to emphasise the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same place’, to make the model of full-time employment the central focus once again, to limit the maximum working week and consider reducing working hours and, above all, with regard to cohesion, to incorporate social progress as a mandatory element and not permit any backward steps.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the responsibility in this European Parliament to regulate the financial markets firmly. All the proposals we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues. The Council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights. Mr Giegold is right when he described what is currently going on as ‘parochial’. The intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations, but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down. We will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets. Inadequate conclusions are being drawn from this financial and economic crisis, which means that the next crisis is already brewing. Many national economies, including those in Europe, will not withstand the blows to come, with all the social and economic repercussions this entails for people living in Europe. They are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored. If the CEO of UniCredit Bank, Alessandro Profumo, says as he did at the weekend that we need a strong, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority and a common set of rules for all Member States, calling for tighter capital rules, this is an appeal to this Parliament to actually draw up these rules. It is this European Parliament’s job to exert pressure on the Council and enforce effective regulation as a matter of urgency. This would be just the first step to a status quo ante
. It is finally time for the grandiose promises to be backed up by actions. My group supports strong European regulation. Any other situation, without regulations, would pose a danger to the euro, a single EU and democracy. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months. I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths? What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work. As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘Let’s see what happens’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious. My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence. Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House! Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model. It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority. I therefore call on Europe’s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures. That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty. Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe’s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports. However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it. Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation. What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme – at best, it is a nanofinance programme! Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out. Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable. Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme. Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect. Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way. In this form, we will reject this programme. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share much of what the Commission has put forward here on the causes and the prospects for the car industry – overcapacities, the need to change strategy, new technologies. However, I would like to point out that there are a number of things that we do not share. Opel will probably not be the last case in the car industry, where there is 30% overcapacity across the globe. We are not only talking about the approximately 12 million people who directly or indirectly live off this industry but the roughly 30 million people throughout Europe who are involved in this industry’s economic output. In this situation, the Commission shares responsibility for ensuring that the European car industry is able to master this challenge. The Commission also shares responsibility for ensuring that Opel does not now become the sacrificial pawn of a free-market clean-up of the crisis. The necessary re-alignment of the management of free market forces in this Union will not automatically balance the anticipated job losses with new jobs. On the contrary, indeed, those in jobs and European national economies will pay the price. The general prevention of State aid will lead to the advent not only of distortions of competition but also social distortions. These will then take a much bigger toll on the coffers of the affected countries than they can afford and, above all, much more than those coffers would be burdened by the aid currently being offered, when you include the dismantlement of social services. The restructuring of the European car industry needs strong initiatives from the Commission, but also from the relevant national governments. We therefore propose a European industry council on the future of mobility involving politicians, businesses, trade unions and academics. It would have to develop possible courses of action for the necessary technical changes and define political measures and the associated funding. Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens. That applied years ago to the steel industry, and it must now apply to Opel and to the car industry in Europe as a whole. State aid can and, in my view, must also be linked to achieving an institutionalised employee participation with extended rights of codecision. All affected employees in Europe need security for their sites, they need new work and new, secure future prospects across Europe.Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, absent representatives of the Council, perhaps you are following the debate on the European Parliament’s videostream, as you clearly have neither the capacity nor the inclination to speak to us live. In my view, the Council’s absence from this debate today shows total disrespect for Parliament. Instead of shying away from this debate, they should explain why they are intent on refusing to make any improvement in the protection of personal data in the police and judicial spheres by means of a directive. We know that the police and judiciary have been an El Dorado for violations of data protection for years, and not only in relation to SWIFT. Violation has now become routine; for example, the personal data of citizens who participate in anti-Nazi demonstrations are unlawfully collected and stored. We need the same standards of protection in the public and the private sphere and in relation to the police and judiciary. This is essential in order to protect civil rights. The Council expects this House to collaborate constructively on regulations of relevance to data protection, such as EU-PNA, but we expect the same of the Council. I therefore urge the Council to stop stalling on data protection at last! Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, this is a never-ending story. I have lost count of the times we have discussed it here. It is a shameful situation that it takes an oral question today to elicit information from the Commission about what it plans to do next with regard to data retention. Let me be frank: instead of deluding itself, the Commission should stop playing games and should face up to reality. That includes admitting that data retention has failed.  The Commission’s aim of establishing uniform rules is quite simply misguided. One reason is that some Member States, due to their constitutional arrangements, are not in a position to transpose the European Directive. What’s more, we have a patchwork of arrangements in the other countries which have transposed the Directive. Some countries store data for six months, others for a year. Some only use the data when investigating serious crime; others use the data to investigate minor delictions. It is a terrible mess, and I do not think we have ever seen anything like it. Now you are taking action against the German Government by referring the matter to the European Court of Justice. Curiously, you argue that Germany’s failure to transpose the Directive is likely to have a negative effect on the internal market and on the ability of the German police to investigate and prosecute serious crime. What did you get that from? How did you come up with that? No one can possibly know whether that claim is true. In fact, studies have revealed a very different picture. The available information includes not only the judgments of the courts and related studies. They also include activity reports such as those produced by the German Bundestag’s Research Services, which is genuinely above suspicion. In 2011, the Research Services found no significant evidence that data retention offers any benefits for the investigation of crime. The reports such as that produced by the Max Planck Institute in 2012 are also beyond reproach. That report states that data retention is of no use whatsoever in the investigation of murders, robberies, child pornography and internet crime. Let me say this, Ms Malmström. If the Commission has nothing new to contribute here, you should at least suspend the Directive pending the judgment of the European Court of Justice. Aside from that, we are calling for a Europe-wide ban on the retention of communications data where there is no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

Mr President, Mr Voss, data retention does not solve any problems. In fact, it is the problem. Let me offer an analogy. Not long ago, I was walking through my home city of Dresden and happened to spot a burglar breaking into a house. Let me ask you this: would you now act on this information by passing a directive which states that women in my age group should stroll through Europe’s cities at night in order to reduce the crime rate? I think we should be asking about the benefits of the Directive. We are nearing the end of this debate and I have just one point to make. Instead of flogging a dead horse – to use your analogy – and filching millions of people’s data, I would suggest that we proceed as follows. Ms Malmström, perhaps you could offer different advice to the Interior Ministers of the EU Member States. You could tell them not to make cuts in the police or law enforcement agencies in their countries. You could tell them to provide decent training for the police and the judiciary and to tackle corruption, which is now widespread. If we manage to achieve that in our countries, we would be making a valuable contribution to combating crime, which would greatly benefit citizens. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, we really ought to speak plainly and clearly today, and this plain-speaking includes the fact that we cannot turn the clock back, and nor do we want to. As Parliament, we have the right under the Treaty to be involved in decisions on all matters relating to Schengen and not just to be casually consulted. That is something that I would like to make clear at the start. I would also like to say that this EU law simply must not be left to the arbitrariness of political freebooters – and that is how I would describe it. Politically motivated contravention – and that is also the term I would choose to use – using the Schengen agreement as a kind of muscle-flexing in election campaigns, is totally unacceptable, and also has nothing to do with EU law. These problems do not only include arbitrary border closures, which we had for a time and which, of course, violate EU law, they also include the installation of cameras at 15 border crossings between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium. If these do not also constitute border controls, then what are they? Furthermore, all that nonsense from a German interior minister concerning the reintroduction of border controls is obviously dangerous. It is dangerous not just because of the problems with Schengen, but also because it represents the arguments of the extreme right, and not just in Germany. Equally unacceptable is the fact that, at the border between Germany and the Czech Republic, which is, incidentally, where I live, buses are constantly being checked. We must not tolerate this. It is not only buses from the Czech Republic that are being checked, but people who look a bit different in some way, for example those who have slightly darker skin, are also being checked. This is also part of the problem. Let us make it very clear that this is not acceptable. We do not want this, because it contravenes the law and because, as Parliament, we do not want this sort of policy. We therefore also express our criticism of the Council’s action in the strongest possible terms. After all, this is not merely a contravention of the law; it is also undemocratic. I therefore suggest that the Council discusses four things with us: Firstly, we ought to be in agreement that there must be no arbitrariness in the way that the Schengen Agreement is implemented. That is something I would like to discuss. Secondly, we want to increase free movement. We want to talk about this. Thirdly, in the event of contraventions of the Schengen Agreement, we want the Commission, with the involvement of the Council, to draw the necessary conclusions. Lastly, as Parliament, we want to be fully involved in all matters, and that includes decision making. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is clear that this is not about individual facts which we have to discuss but about the fundamental issue of our attitude to democracy and civil liberties. When we look at the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), it becomes clear that it is, to a certain extent, symbolic of a lack of transparency and democracy and of the violation of fundamental rights, because it was drawn up secretly behind the scenes using an undemocratic process and because the free use of the Internet was simply no longer possible and neither was there the freedom to use generic medicines to the degree that we currently do. These are the reasons why millions of people have taken to the streets and have long since anticipated the vote on ACTA. There has already been a vote on ACTA on the streets, on the Internet and in relation to the Committee on Petitions in many countries, not only inside but also outside the EU. I believe that we must not ignore this vote. It is a demonstration of direct democracy by the many citizens who elected us. I can only say that we should put ACTA to one side. That is the only decent thing to do. Cornelia Ernst,

 Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, the EU’s open borders represent the most important symbol of the Union around the world, and they have a deep allure to many people across the globe. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as you know, have always criticised the fact that the EU is also associated with fencing off the outside at the same time. That is precisely the reason why it was so important to us to retain a built-in European emergency mechanism, but the Council was up in arms about that idea. I can only say to you that what you are doing here, what you, the Council, are celebrating, is troglodytic. Go back to the basic principles of the Community! I beg you to do that! Put an end to this kind of, ultimately, anti-European politics. Ladies and gentlemen, the policy of the Council in this case is anti-democratic, as it seeks to downgrade Parliament to the status of a consulted body. We will not tolerate this, however. We have it in writing, we have a Treaty right to codecision, and we intend to – and will – exercise that right. My second point is that the Council’s decision is deeply anti-European because it nationalises Schengen. I ask you, the Council, the Danish Presidency: do you want to bring back the customs borders? Do you want to go back to the 19th century? What signs are you hoping to send to the outside world with this decision? You are making yourselves look ridiculous to the world, and to Europe. My third point is that this decision by the Council is populist, in the truest sense of the word, and provides a boost to the forces of nationalism, exactly those people who want to retreat to the nations and destroy the Europe that we have built. We cannot settle for that. I appeal to you to take back your decision, and be Europeans again! Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I believe that we are faced with a very sensitive issue when we come to talk about residence restrictions, particularly because this gives a push to right-wing populist and extremist forces. When we see the populist right-wing Swiss People’s Party successfully campaigning for a referendum on the issue of quotas for non-nationals, then we find ourselves on the horns of a dilemma. There is something that I want to state clearly on behalf of our group: neither EU citizens nor anyone else should be allowed to become political footballs or the object of cheap right-wing propaganda as a result of so-called mass immigration, in this case involving Switzerland. The problem is particularly difficult because it relates to European citizens. If we look at who obtains the largest number of residence permits, we find that over two-thirds are EU citizens. In April 2012, the Swiss authorities, in a hasty response, decided to introduce quotas for certain countries. If we take a closer look, we can see a contradiction here: if we consider the breakdown for residence permits as a whole, then we find that most are granted to Germans and Italians, not Czechs or Poles. The proportion of nationals from the eight countries in question is really relatively small and yet the 10 % rule is being invoked, something quite ridiculous in comparison with citizens of other countries. This again shows what happens when one deals with such questions in terms of percentages. You soon find yourself falling into a huge trap, as I would remind you. It is politically dubious and counterproductive for Switzerland to invoke the agreement with the EU, referring to Article 10(4). We see this as a violation of the directive on the freedom of movement and the agreement with Switzerland and, above all, we consider it as discrimination against specific citizens and Member States. That must not be allowed to happen. We need equal treatment for all EU citizens, including in relation to Switzerland. We must be absolutely clear about this. For this reason, we refuse on principle to discuss quotas here, as they actually fan the flames of xenophobia. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, firstly, either there are uniform EU visa rules and a binding reciprocity mechanism for all Member States, in which case the Commission – as Guardian of the Treaties – must fight hard for these to be implemented, or there are not, in which case the Commission has already been tolerating a two-tier system for EU citizens for many years, and my group considers that absolutely unacceptable. We demand that the Commission resolves this problem without delay and prior to concluding the agreement with Canada. Otherwise, the reciprocity mechanism must apply. That is my first point. At the same time, however, we have to take ourselves seriously, which leads me to ask whether the new visa regulation will at least strengthen the reciprocity mechanism? Is that the case? Can we in fact prevent such practices as have occurred in relation to Canada from occurring again in future? The only thing I can say to that is: by no means. What has emerged, however, is that visa policy continues to be used as a means of exerting pressure against migration. As my third point, can we please talk for once about the population group that is often meant when we talk about the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania. It is the Roma. Many Roma have gone to Canada, and the Czech Republic argues that Canada is itself to blame for this because Canada has for years created incentives for high levels of immigration through its generous and tolerant asylum policy. That is Canada’s argument, and they are doing nothing to counter this. On the contrary, they go so far as to support it by saying: well, how is it that EU citizens are even able to go to third countries and claim asylum? Indeed, why is that? It is because the Roma have miserable living conditions in the EU – a situation of which we have been aware for many years, in which they are so discriminated against and excluded that it is no wonder that people are going to countries such as Canada. To me, this issue is also a kind of Lex Roma
; and to that extent, if we really want to do something about it, if we want to prevent emigration, then we have to improve conditions at home. That is what we should be looking at. Cornelia Ernst,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left intends voting against this agreement because it nullifies an elementary right of EU citizens, namely the right to the protection of personal data. Ms Malmström, I can only shake my head in despair at what you have had to say. You seem to be chasing an imaginary level of security that does not exist and that will not come into existence with this agreement or any other agreement of this kind. We are not talking about a small amount of travel information about European citizens, but rather about the combination of this information with other long-established databases, enabling profiling and thus the monitoring of individual citizens. We reject this agreement because no adequate evidence has been provided – not even by you, Ms Malmström – of the possible benefits of this agreement. We also oppose it because proportionality and purpose limitation are taken to absurd lengths when millions of data records belonging to innocent citizens are retained. We reject it because the use of this data goes far beyond the purpose you have indicated – the fight against terrorism and the combating of serious, organised, cross-border crime. Article 4 contains an escape clause that also needs to be discussed. This clause significantly widens the purpose for which data can be used. We cannot support this agreement because it involves the processing and forwarding of the PNR data to an authority, the Department of Homeland Security, where the intelligence services hold power, and even to third countries; none of this can be controlled by Parliament, so that there is no guarantee of transparency. We reject the agreement because the period for which the data is to be retained goes against all understanding of proportionality and appropriateness, whereby even sensitive data can be retained for 30 days and possibly even longer. This is scandalous. It is quite impossible for our group to vote in favour because there is no serious provision for judicial remedy. The judicial remedy provisions contained in the agreement are laughable. All that is offered is a limited right to information and it is not even possible to take legal recourse according to a proper data protection law. This is just not possible. Judicial remedy is transformed into the obstruction of justice. To Mr Voss and the other Members who intend voting in favour of this agreement I would say: if our own EU Treaties mean anything to us, then we must reject this agreement. It is all a question of responsibility, Mr Voss, namely responsibility to the citizens of the European Union. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, our group supported the call at the time of the last amendment to the Biometric Passports Regulation in 2009 for a review to be carried out in three years’ time and for four studies to be presented. One of the reasons that our group supported this was because it has expressed major concerns time and again on the grounds of data protection and also on account of the overestimation of the benefit of using biometric data in passports. The belief in the perfect form of identification, the overestimation of this method too, and – associated with this – the overestimation of other parts of the security chain are genuinely problematic. The use of biometric data is still subject to this major misconception, namely the assumption that these data are unchangeable and mostly reliable. That is absolutely not the case. These data are also subject to change throughout a person’s life. They differ between childhood and old age. We therefore need reliable and sound studies and conclusions. People are still busily forging these documents. We have now been able to establish this. As the incidents in the United Kingdom and other countries repeatedly demonstrate, the chips are definitely not safe from misuse. They are readily cracked and, for those concerned, this can result in permanent damage. The standards within the EU also differ widely. The error rate – as seen in France and the Netherlands – is very high. We need to ask ourselves again and again what benefit we get from biometric data if documents are falsified and enter into circulation. Thus, if one part of the chain is falsified and the ‘breeder’ documents are at variance, biometric data would no longer be of any help to us. The Chaos Computer Club in Germany needed a few minutes only to demonstrate the falsification of a chip. For this, the people of the Chaos Computer Club needed the cap of a plastic bottle, some superglue, a digital camera and a little wood glue, and in a few minutes they had cracked the chip. So much for supposed security. We are waiting for the Commission to present the studies and, of course, also the results and the lessons that can be drawn from them. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, has anyone in this Parliament actually ever written a report about the number of men in middle and top positions who are mediocre, low-achievers? Had there been such a report, it would have observed – as we already know from our real lives – that a great number of men who really are not effective and not particularly brilliant nevertheless occupy top positions. We would also have hit upon the idea that perhaps the factor of excellence in performance, which is supposed to be the sole criterion for top positions, is not, in fact, the only factor. There is a glass ceiling for women, also known as structural discrimination, and as long as that is the case, we will need this quota. It is very crude tool: all the quota does is to create formal equality, which is the prerequisite for bringing about real equality of rights and fairness between the sexes. It seems to me that we should not beat around the bush, we should give this our clear support and I am therefore nailing my colours to the mast in support of this quota. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am still somewhat astonished. After years of Mr Barroso and his colleagues in the Council having pursued a policy of austerity, and successfully having forced upon everyone unemployment and cuts in social security spending under the umbrella of the crisis, they have now discovered the unemployed. As important as this subject certainly is, it sounds like mockery if you see the promotional film for it on EuroparlTV, which talks about additional funding. I have a simple question for you, Mr Hahn, namely, where in your petty cash can you find EUR 82 billion? We all know that everything is actually already planned up to 2013 – and we are not far from the point where that door will be closing. We should not be dealing in tricks, nor should we be talking as if everyone could now receive the same funding or indeed adequate funding. Quite specifically, what is the situation with Ireland, for example, which, as we all know, has already spent all of its resources? What advice do you have for the Irish Government when it comes to combating youth unemployment? It is self-evident that we need to make major efforts in employment policy in order to reduce youth unemployment. That much is clear, but we also need real money to be able to do so. We also need to get behind it. Furthermore, there are, of course, other things that we need, such as more sensible protection against dismissal, or truly decent work. Finally, I would just like to reiterate what it is that we do not need, namely macro-economic conditionality over the forthcoming subsidy period. That is something that we should not even look into. We are observing at this point in time what that means. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent sanctions by the EU are not confidence-building measures, but sabre rattling. That is a fact. Attempting to get Iran to compromise by exerting more pressure is politically naive and also irresponsible. As the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, we do not want any nuclear programmes, that is clear, including in Iran. We strongly condemn the Iranian regime on account of its horrendous human rights violations, oppression of religious minorities and persecution of human rights activists, but stopping Iranian oil as a result of the de facto trade ban with Iran’s Central Bank will ultimately hit ordinary citizens. That is a fact. It will also help the Iranian regime’s election campaign ahead of the elections in March this year and will increase the risk of war throughout the region. That, Baroness Ashton, is the scale of what we are talking about here. There is as yet no genuine proof that Iran has a current nuclear weapons programme. There are indications up to 2003, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has provided no evidence for the period thereafter in its report. It has assumptions and the claims of the secret services. Instead of an escalation, we need a human rights dialogue and serious negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Middle East and peaceful coexistence throughout the region. That is what the EU should be doing instead of making the current situation worse. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I would like to make the following point. We are not talking about the economic situation in Hungary. We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries. It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants. Instead, I would like to see Article 7 applied, because this situation involves a clear risk of a serious breach of the fundamental values of the EU. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the combined work and residence permit for third-country nationals in the EU came in like a lion and is going out like a lamb, to coin a phrase. This in no way opens the way for a truly simplified regulation for third-country nationals who would like to work in the EU. That remains the case even if residence is increasingly being linked with work. In many cases that may be all well and good – but it is the only focus here, and we see that as a problem. Furthermore, we do not feel that this directive is a step in the right direction. Firstly, this is because its scope is too narrow. Its provisions are narrow-minded and provincial. It is not just that it is only to be applicable to the executing Member State and not to the EU as a whole; that does not even get mentioned any more. It is also that the regulation is not to apply to family members of Union citizens if they are third-country nationals, nor to seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees or people under international or temporary protection. This gives rise to all kinds of individual directives, and as a result there are different classes of third-country nationals with differing rights. My second point is that there is no real simplification or legal harmonisation, and this is true through the mere fact that the Member States actually have the final say on all matters – such as whether it is the employer or the employee who is to apply for the permit. If it is the employer, the potential employee may not even get to see the application, such as in cases where it is rejected. He will have absolutely no opportunity to comment legally in any form whatsoever. We are also critical of the fact that an application may be deemed inadmissible if the Member State sets quotas for the labour market. The third point I would like to make – and I will concede this to the rapporteur – is that it is good that pension entitlements will be recognised. It is absolutely unacceptable, however, that there is not completely equal treatment with employees who are EU nationals. There are to be considerable restrictions – and these will depend on the class of person – when it comes to vocational training, social benefits – such as for family members – and access to public housing. That is really not acceptable. If that is made a fundamental principle, then it is a mistake and we cannot support it. That is why we are rejecting this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, a few hours ago, an important prize was awarded here in this Chamber. It was said that freedom, justice and solidarity are pillars of the European Union. However, I would like to ask you: how can that be reconciled with the fact that racist violence against the Roma is to a certain degree the order of the day in very many Member States and is a constant state of affairs in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and the Balkans? It is also the case that Roma, who are EU citizens, are being expelled not only from France, but also from Denmark, Italy, Germany and Finland. However, freedom, solidarity and justice, of which we speak so often here, should apply universally or not at all. It is scandalous – I cannot put it any better – if, despite an EU framework strategy, despite numerous promises by the Member States, the largest minority in Europe continues to be discriminated against. In the Czech Republic, I spoke with Roma families that were utterly shocked and, above all, frightened because anti-Roma demonstrations had been taking place for months right outside their front door – and with banners containing the words: ‘gas the Roma’! That is shocking, not just as a neighbour of these Roma, but it also not worthy of our history when we simply tolerate such a thing or attempt to change it with the use a few more police officers. In the Czech Republic, as in many other countries, Roma children still attend separate schools – and in the Czech Republic, for example, they go to schools with disabled children. As a left-leaning politician, I say to you that the Roma do not belong in separate schools, and neither do disabled children. That violates human rights and I believe that that needs to be said in this regard. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that separate schools for Roma are illegal. Despite this, these schools merrily continue. As we all know, the European Roma Rights Centre has examined 44 cases in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and found that violent attacks on Roma were utterly inadequately prosecuted and that no convictions were brought at all. Many law enforcement agencies are totally blind when it comes to the Roma. Moreover, the Czech Senate unabashedly confirmed recently that it will not participate in a Roma strategy. That is apartheid in action at the heart of Europe. We have to do something about this. There will also be a price to pay for the fact that the Roma framework strategy does not lay down any binding requirements and that the subject of anti-racism does not form part of this strategy. I can say to you quite honestly that enough is enough.; I would ask the Commission how long it intends to continue to sit back and watch. Where is the consistency in its actions when it comes, for example, to framework decisions for combating racism and the Anti-discrimination Directive being implemented – properly implemented – in the Member States? Article 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for the possibility of action being taken against Member States that have seriously breached the values of the EU. I therefore call on you most urgently to make use of this provision. After all, we must defend the rights and freedoms of the Roma as European citizens. Who will do that if we do not?

Mr President, I have a question for Mr Hahn concerning the delegated acts. These acts play an important role in cohesion policy and it is also clear to me that delegated acts are necessary for the implementation of a number of issues. Parliament and the Council also have a withdrawal option, which is a good thing. However, I believe that the situation has got rather out of hand and that these acts are being used in the case of questions which we in Parliament should be deciding on together with the Council. One example is the common strategic framework, Articles 10 and 11 of the general regulation, which lays down goals for subsidies from the Cohesion Fund, important challenges in the territorial area and actions to be taken centrally. My question is: why have you chosen the delegated act in the case of such an important document, for example, and not the ordinary legislative procedure? In this context, perhaps you can make some general remarks about the problems of delegated acts. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr Hahn, you have already made some remarks on macro-economic conditionality. You have said that it will probably not be used at all, or at least only in an emergency or a similar situation. However, I would like to ask you nevertheless: is there a built-in safeguard and is it possible to prevent particularly disadvantaged regions, which would not receive money if a conditionality of this kind were to take effect, being put at a further disadvantage?

 Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a broader scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is taking a clear stance against this agreement, and will vote accordingly, in the clear knowledge that there are some aspects of the agreement that might seem acceptable according to the principle of ‘a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Of course we have understood this, thanks to Ms in ’t Veld. The counter-arguments are more convincing, however. We still have no proof of the need to record PNR data. The mass of data, or so-called waste data, actually makes it harder to find potential criminals. Despite everything, what we have here is a willy-nilly approach to data retention, even when no suspicion exists, and this, as my colleague has pointed out, is prohibited, not just in Germany but in several other Member States too. We wish to register genuinely serious concerns that this agreement cannot be reconciled with EU law. That is why we requested a corresponding legal opinion, which we are also presenting for the purposes of the discussion and vote. Even though it is, of course, better to a certain extent to have some sort of retention period rather than none at all, I would ask you seriously why it is necessary to store data for five-and-a-half years. This makes profiling realistic and feasible, particularly since it is not completely and definitively excluded by this agreement. A word about the scope of the agreement: the Commissioner referred to the fact that serious cross-border crime does not exist as a criminal offence in Australia. It simply does not exist. Instead of a minimum mandatory sentence of four years, we would have been better served with a list of specific criminal offences. Otherwise, our main concern is that this agreement will be used as the template for negotiations with the US, but not because the agreement is so bad, but rather because at least in Australia the data is processed by the customs authorities when it arrives there, while in the US, the responsible authority is the unknown quantity that is the Department of Homeland Security. This agreement turns innocent people into objects of suspicion on a wholesale basis and undermines elementary freedoms. My group wants nothing to do with this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, body scanners are placebos. If you look it up in Wikipedia, a placebo is a sham medicine that contains no active ingredient and thus has no pharmacological effect. The fact is that a ten-month test phase in Germany, for example, showed that body scanners resulted in a lower level of security than conventional methods and were therefore a failure. Sweat stains were signalled as a security risk, tissues as a danger. There were false alarm levels of up to 100%. No body scanner in the world can analyse body orifices or inside the body. Objects hidden there cannot be detected. We should not suppose that terrorists are more stupid than they are. Where body scanners were used regularly, it was not the success rate that went up, but rather the abuse rate. Take a look at the US: a woman there had to remove her breast prosthesis to prove what it was, and that was after scanning. In the UK, two women refused to be scanned for religious or health reasons and were not permitted to fly. The most embarrassing body checks exist as alternatives in various countries. The risk of abuse is likely to rise further in the future simply because the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided, as stated previously, that real body images are possible. That means being able to see the actual outlines. There have already been cases of offensive remarks having increased and that is a human rights problem. The word placebo comes from the Latin and means ‘I will please’. The only ones this will please are the market leaders in body scanners that make and sell this rubbish. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there can scarcely be another institution established by the European Union that is so controversial when it comes to human rights as Frontex is. This agency is associated with shameful images on the high seas where thousands of people have lost their lives, of land borders where people are kept in custody and where deep trenches are now being dug. At heart, Frontex embodies an erring policy towards refugees in Europe, refugees who leave their homelands not only as a result of political persecution, but also for economic reasons – simply to survive – as a result of hunger, civil wars and climate disasters. The new Frontex mandate does incorporate real and substantial improvements – and for that I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Busuttil – such as the obligation to respect human dignity, the right of non-refoulement, non-discrimination, the prohibition of torture, the respect of refugee minors, and the guaranteeing of data protection. Rescues at sea are now finally to be given stability and there is to be a code of conduct for border officials – but it is also true that the mandate does not lay down a principle of refraining from the use of violence. Furthermore, who is to be responsible for actually checking up on proportionality and appropriateness? Frontex is having its competence clearly expanded as the lead body in border patrols and as the body that produces risk analyses, on the basis of which interventions and the return to their homelands of thousands and thousands more migrants will take place. Heaven knows how hard Parliament struggled to obtain improvements, but they will make no difference to the fact that a wolf is still a wolf, even if it is dressed in sheep’s clothing. Frontex is not necessary either as a border agency – the national defence institutions serve that purpose – or to repel migration, as migration is not, in fact, repelled, but merely territorially displaced. Frontex is absolutely not suitable to act as custodian of human rights, given that, ultimately, it categorises people as legal or illegal. People cannot be illegal! I do not understand how that is not accepted. In place of Frontex, what we need is a humanisation of the refugee situation, in Africa, for example, where almost a million refugees live in degrading conditions. That does not interest us, or only does so to a limited extent. We would rather take care of ourselves. We need an asylum system that demonstrates solidarity, at European level too, of course, and we definitely need a new neighbourhood policy on an equal footing. That, too, still lies ahead.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what kind of anachronism is this when, 22 years after the historic fall of the Berlin Wall, an EU Member State like Denmark re-introduces border controls? This is a dire warning for the entire European Union. We all know that the Schengen agreement does indeed allow for temporary border controls to be introduced in special circumstances, as we saw with the football World Cup in Germany in 2006. The Schengen system does not need any additional mechanism. If the Danish Government re-introduces permanent controls at its borders with Germany and Sweden, that constitutes an infringement of the agreement. I expect nothing less from the Commission than to treat this as what it is – an infringement of the agreement. This genie must be re-bottled, as freedom and freedom of movement are not up for negotiation; they are fundamental values that shape the European Union. They cannot be sacrificed to national vanities and the extreme Right. We do not need to change the Schengen agreement. We need more humanitarian asylum and migration laws. We do not need additional customs officials on the German-Danish border – what we need are steps to protect refugees and people fleeing from civil war. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already adopted a number of resolutions on the subject of passenger name records (PNR), which include specific requirements. In all cases these have been concerned with necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and the prohibition of profiling. We consider the legal basis of the agreement with Australia to be inappropriate. The agreement with Australia is aimed at harmonising the transfer of data prescribed under Australian law with European law, and particularly the law on data protection. An absolute requirement, therefore, is that reference must be made to Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Moreover, we would question once again its proportionality. If you bear in mind that, according to the Australian Government, in 2009 just five people were traced and accused of terrorist offences – and it was not even clear whether this was achieved as a result of PNR data – then it does not seem particularly proportionate for millions of records nonetheless to be retained for years on end. As we all know, when it comes down to it they are being used for profiling purposes – and we do not even have a uniform agreed definition of profiling yet. I do not know how often the Commission has already been asked for such reasons to prove that the transfer of PNR data is necessary, or to present and look into alternatives. A really substantive report is necessary if this is to be investigated. One more comment on purpose limitation: how can we ensure that the data is used only for the intended purpose if various third countries conclude agreements with each other under which PNR data is systematically exchanged? This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to ensure this. Moreover, we are awaiting a very clear answer from the Commission on the relationship between PNR and the US Secure Flight programme. As everyone is aware, the purpose of the Secure Flight programme is to exclude so-called potentially dangerous passengers from flights. There have been frequent cases of mistakes being made and passengers being misidentified, as a result of which the persons concerned have been prevented from travelling and have practically no legal means by which to defend themselves. One final word: please do not forget that we are talking not just about self-determination – about self-determination in the sphere of information – but also, and above all, about freedom of movement as a basic right, as laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of the intermediate category, I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning, Mr Pieper, for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 2013. However, it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions, in particular those hit by the crisis. We are currently talking about 51 regions. When confronted with so many regions that have been affected, it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category. This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves. In other respects, Mr Pieper’s report contains a great deal of light and shade. Among other things, we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty. We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation. It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time that Bulgaria and Romania were included in the full application of the Schengen acquis. Think about it – the abolition of controls on the internal borders and the creation of freedom of movement are some of the most important achievements and values of the European Union. For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States – including my home country of Germany – totally incomprehensible. The arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered. Given the opinions that have been presented, I cannot understand these arguments. A dangerous game is being played with Bulgaria and Romania here. For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen. Like the other Members on the Committee, we were extremely alienated by the Council’s impossible behaviour towards Parliament and by how, at the beginning, it even refused to allow us to review the documents. Overall, the opinion on the table is a positive one. We expect that Schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until September. To close, I would like to quote the Bucharest-based journalist, Sabina Fati. She stated, ‘The Romanians are euphoric citizens. They look upon Western Europe as a place whose standards they absolutely want to achieve. To turn your backs on them now could lead many of them to become eurosceptics’. That is not something that we want in either Romania or Bulgaria. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to get to the point here. We do not need a new rule on the temporary or any other reintroduction of border controls, either now or in the future. We need to grasp that freedom of movement – and that is, after all, the message of the European Union – is something that you cannot simply displace or circumvent at will. It is a citizens’ right that you cannot simply relativise. Do you want to know what honestly annoys me? We hear a lot said about solidarity. Who is talking about solidarity with the countries of Africa who are currently having to accommodate hundreds of thousands of refugees and will continue to do so – without great debate? Is anyone talking about solidarity with the people who are fleeing war and coming here to Europe? We need to show these people a bit of respect. To be frank, I do not want to discuss any changes to Schengen or any rules whatsoever; I simply want us to deal sensibly with migration once and for all. We will not achieve this by using Frontex as a means of deporting people; we will achieve it by having a democratic and humanitarian asylum law. That is what we should be talking about in Europe and it must apply throughout Europe. That is what we should fight for. That is our real task. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that we are now to have a general strategy for the Roma, but I am afraid that that not everything in the garden is rosy. That is because the overall proposals that the Commission has placed on the table are far behind the many years of discussions with representatives of the Roma, some of which were held in this House. For years, representatives of the Roma community, both with and without a framework strategy, have been pointing out the need for targeted measures and clear, specific requirements. We do not even have clear sanctions should this strategy not be adhered to. Although there have been some proposals in this direction, no actual sanctions exist, so that the system is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese. The strategy on the Roma must take account of all the significant areas. This is what was agreed. However, what does the Commission have to offer other than the four key points? There is no provision in the structures for the participation and inclusion of the Roma communities in all the decisions that relate to them. There are no structures for the specific implementation of targets. There is no gender perspective. Something that also really irritates me and that I believe to be a scandal is the fact that you are unwilling to undertake any explicit action to combat discrimination against the Roma community. You complain that the EU structural funds for the Roma are not used. I would like to ask you quite openly: Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date? I think so. We, as members of the GUE/NGL Group, are highly critical of this communication. We do not believe it to be adequate and I expect the appropriate amendments to be made. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to address three points. Firstly, we should make it clear that we are indeed able to provide assistance to refugees from North Africa, particularly from Tunisia, and that we also want to do so. I therefore also welcome the fact that the Commission wishes to activate Directive 2001/55/EC for giving temporary protection and I would, at the same time, call for all Member States to actually utilise this, not only Italy, but also France and Germany – above all, the countries that are actually in a position to invest. Secondly, we expect a clear statement from the Commission to the effect that any agreements entered into with dictators like Ben Ali or Gaddafi concerning the prevention of migration – that is how I would describe them – are null and void. Genuine partnerships with third countries, like Mrs Malmström mentioned, are probably not comparable with Italy’s idea of buying the readiness to take back refugees with EUR 150 million. Instead of showing solidarity in respect of the prevention of refugees, we should be showing practical solidarity with North African States like Tunisia, to which 150 000 people have fled. Thirdly, we need to understand how fragile the ground is on which the EU refugee prevention instruments are standing. Frontex and Dublin II – we need a rethink where these are concerned. We need liberal asylum and migration legislation in Europe and a different development policy that is genuinely sustainable. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to get right to the heart of the matter, this is all about introducing a uniform, mandatory EU strategy, instead of the 27 individual, differing strategies in the Member States. Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens. What is it all about? It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone. It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe. It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services. We are not doing these people a favour. We are granting them their legal rights. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti. We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding. There is, though, one thing I would like to add. None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe. We must see this as one of Europe’s central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination. We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole. We must speak with one voice. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important moment, because today, for the first time in the European Parliament, we are commemorating the Roma and Sinti victims of the Holocaust. Let me start by with a farewell letter written by a 14-year-old boy, Robert Reinhard, in 1943 before his deportation to Auschwitz from a German children’s home. He wrote: ‘I have found my parents again. We are being transported to the concentration camp. After much soul-searching I have reached the point where I can face death. Thank you once again for everything that you have done for me. Greetings to you all. See you in heaven. Robert.’ Like 500 000 other Roma and Sinti, this young boy never came back, and although the Roma and Sinti, together with the Jews, were the first victims of production line killing, today – 66 years on – the full truth of what happened remains untold. The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over. We need the whole truth about this chapter of history. The Roma and Sinti must be avenged and the Holocaust recognised as a crime against humanity, to ensure that it can never happen again. We must fight fervently to eradicate the prejudice against these people. We must put an end to racial hatred as well as violence, as seen the year before last in Hungary for example, and we should do this with the courage of our convictions. Freedom, equality and solidarity are not the privilege of a few, but a right for all, because human rights and civil rights are indivisible. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, the European Protection Order is a step in the right direction. The principle must be that recognised victims of violence are afforded the same level of protection in all Member States. The best solution would be harmonisation of the laws of the Member States on this matter, but it was not possible to achieve this. A positive aspect of this protection order is that it is to benefit every victim of violence as much as possible and its scope is broad: sexual violence, stalking and, above all, exploitation of minors, which I consider to be very, very important. It therefore sends a positive message to the victims of violence and to women in particular. However, there is one fly in the ointment: the grounds for non-recognition in Article 9 are very extensive and may also, to some extent, represent a means for Member States to avoid compliance with the directive. Therefore, in a year’s time, we need to assess very carefully how we can take this debate further, because all victims in all countries need the same protection. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs. They have done a huge amount of work and, as a result, definite progress has been made. It could be said that the draft directive is extremely important for the hundreds of thousands of victims of human trafficking and it should put an end to their lawless status. It goes as far as to say that not only protection, but also prevention and, above all, compensation, should play a part. It has a broad area of application relating to human trafficking. We believe this to be right, even though we, of course, have difficulty with the problem of begging – which I openly admit – and also in many respects with illegal migration. It is right that references to gender are to be found throughout this directive and – what to me is the most important point – that the welfare of children is taken into account in the case of unaccompanied minors. I would also like to say from a German point of view that in this respect, we have a lot of ground to make up and I am very pleased that this aspect concerning the children plays a very important part in this draft directive. Another point worthy of recognition is the fact that, when dealing with this problem, special account must be taken of pregnant women and people suffering from illness or disability. Preventive measures, such as the training of public officials and the introduction of coordinators in the Member States, constitute major steps in the right direction. If we vote in favour of this today, we deserve to be congratulated. I also hope that this subject will be taken more seriously in the Member States, because in any case, they now have to present reports. Perhaps that will also go some way towards achieving this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will simply ask the question: what is the situation with regard to anti-discrimination and the equal treatment of Roma in Europe? When we now hear that ethnically motivated databases on the Roma – and I believe these databases as such are prohibited – are being set up by the French Gendarmerie, but also by other countries, and, to a certain extent, for preventative purposes, then that really is the limit. Both in France and in the EU, databases that are primarily used to compile personal data on the racial or ethnic origin of people are quite simply prohibited due to the high risk of them being misused and on account of the risk of discrimination. Only under very particular – purpose-specific – circumstances, which take non-discrimination into consideration, can the collection of data of this nature be carried out at all. The Roma must not be criminalised, and that is the crucial point. Ethnically motivated databases for the purpose of preventing crimes are unlawful. The Roma must not be the subject of the special collection of data on account of their way of life, and we expect the Commission, in other words you, Mrs Reding, to repudiate any form of ethnic or racist data collection and to work hard to ensure that this is indeed stopped in the relevant countries. Frankly, I ask myself more and more what it is other than talk, talk, talk that actually happens in this Parliament and in the framework of the EU, and what, in practical terms, we have actually managed to do to improve the situation of the Roma in Europe other than talk, talk, talk. If we look at the collection of data, we see that the Roma have become scapegoats and people to push around in many Member States of the EU. They are being deported to Kosovo and, in doing this, France has been contravening EU treaties for months, the principle of anti-discrimination is being violated – and the Commission behaves as if it is satisfied – and I see this rather differently to the previous speaker – with the promise by the French Government to provide the legal basis for transposing the directive on freedom of movement by the beginning of 2011. In the interests of decency, however, it must be said that France has to put a stop to the deportations of Roma, and it is also important for those Roma who have been unjustly deported to have their return to France facilitated. In connection with the databases, I would like to ask you: what definite information to you have, what initiatives will you take, if these databases actually exist in this way, and will you initiate treaty infringement proceedings in such cases? Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we should ask ourselves what we are actually trying to achieve with this whole debate. Are we trying to bring about a small improvement in equality and a little assistance for families as cheaply as possible? Of course, making family life compatible with work costs money. I would simply like to ask my fellow Members from Germany: what is expenditure of EUR 1 billion in Germany if, at the same time, we are handing out EUR 450 billion in bank guarantees? What do we actually want in this area? Full pay for parental leave is quite correct. What else should it be? It is not time off, it is not holiday; this is work that people are doing. Of course we want the period extended to 20 weeks, because we believe that this is the only way this work can be accommodated. Moreover, we do not merely want to bring about a bit more equality in working life. We want complete equality, for women and men. We need to take drastic steps if we are to achieve this, such as a statutory minimum wage in all Member States. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my thanks to Mrs Fajon for her excellent report, which has really moved us forward on this issue. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is very clear in its support for visa liberalisation throughout the Western Balkans, and in this case we are, of course, also in favour of the removal of the visa requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, specifically so that the opening up of these countries actually gets under way and because it will provide better opportunities for their overall development. We hope that such opportunities will really be exploited. Personally, I would also like to see this kind of arrangement in place for Kosovo very soon – or at least for initial talks to take place. There is an urgent need for this, as Kosovo is otherwise a small island in the Western Balkans that is actually cut off. What worries me, however – and I want to make this point – is that we are compelling the introduction, at the same time, of biometric data. I want to be very clear on this: the use of biometric data is as controversial as ever and, above all, the use of such data is not secure. I say this on the back of news in Germany a few days ago that the PIN codes can be, and have been, cracked. There needs to be an acknowledgement that this kind of thing can happen. Let us do everything we can to ensure not only that these countries have their visa requirement lifted, but that social and economic development is set in train there. There is an urgent need for this in both countries, and the people have earned it. We in the EU should also work towards this goal. Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called voluntary exodus of the Roma from France is a clear case of expulsion – and indeed of the largest and oldest population group that constitutes a minority in Europe. This will encourage those on the political right, the extreme right. We must reject this – including here in the European Parliament. This is vital. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left therefore demands an end to these deportations. Mrs Reding, I would have liked you, too, to call for us first to demand an end to these deportations and then everything else that follows on from that. President Sarkozy’s government is contravening EU law, because it is carrying out the wholesale deportation of Roma, who originate from EU Member States, without consideration of individual cases, because it is invalidating the principle of free movement, it is violating the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is violating the Charter with regard to equal treatment. I say to you in all sincerity that it is finally time for action. We have already discussed this problem numerous times. We now need to take real measures that will bring about a change. The Roma are at home in Europe. They are part of the European Community and should also remain so. We must make sure of it. We are therefore also critical of the deportation of Roma from Germany, Austria, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and other countries in the Western Balkans. We need an integrated European strategy, and one for all Roma, not only some of them. We must fight for this. My final point is that the European idea of solidarity and self-determination must be evident in our dealings with the Roma minority, otherwise it does not exist. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate must focus on two aspects. One aspect, namely that of data protection, has now been very frequently addressed. It is quite true that some things have been improved, but the simple fact is that the transfer of bulk data has not been eliminated. What really annoys me the most is that, where data protection is concerned, Europol has, in fact, been given an extension of its powers: on what legal basis, we ask? However, I also wish to say quite clearly that there is also another aspect, about which we must talk very seriously, namely that even if all the data protection problems were to be solved, every last one, the question would remain whether the principle according to which the bank data of millions of people in Europe is transferred for prevention purposes actually makes a real contribution to the fight against terror. I doubt it profoundly, and there has been no evaluation and nothing to support it. Instead, a de facto
 surveillance of citizens will be introduced, and I wish to remind you that even the Data Protection Officer does not see the necessity of such a regulation. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE) 
Madam President, first of all, let me say that I believe – and I am referring to the Schengen Information System here – that the EU should not be operating a wish-based policy, but a policy based on the reality. When it comes to the Schengen Information System, that means that we must take account of the fact that the tests – what have been called the ‘first milestone’ – have failed. After eight years of tinkering, we know that the aim of the measure proposed by the Commission – the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II – is unachievable by the Member States, both on technical and legal grounds. That is not my evaluation – it is the evaluation of the Federal Republic of Germany. That is the position back in my home country, and it is a position, by the way, that I fully share. EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme, and the Commission would like to spend more. We do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013; we want to make that very plain. Instead, we want to abandon this system and start the search for an alternative. Secondly, the German Left Party is fundamentally critical of SIS II – I want to point that out, too, at this juncture – as access to the system is being dramatically extended, for example, to the secret services. In Germany, there is a requirement that the secret services and the police are separated. Thus, any mixing of the secret services’ and the police’s data will mean that the whole system will be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court. That is something that I needed to mention, at least from the German point of view. We also oppose SIS II because it involves the collection of vast quantities of data and the gathering and recording of biometric data. That is neither purposive nor proportionate.

Madam President, freedom over the clouds, as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang, will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data. In August, a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having. Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists, the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space. As we all know in this House, this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding. Today, US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data – credit card numbers, booking data, seating preferences, special food preferences, IP addresses and passenger information – without clear data protection regulations. I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that, as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying, referred to as PNR, as it now is to be developed. We cannot support it as it is currently formulated, because it is not for a specific purpose, and it is not proportionate or useful. Finally, I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour. We need disclosure regulations like the USA’s privacy act. These must be opened to European citizens. The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague who is unable to be here and I would like to make a few remarks. The first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the Structural Funds. There are certainly some things which we would criticise and Mrs Schroedter has mentioned these, but I believe that we should not hold back for this reason alone. We welcome the simplification and are also of the opinion that the regulation must be implemented urgently. Too much time has already been wasted. However, I must speak openly. The compromise is not exactly how we had envisaged it. As everyone is aware, the Commission submitted another proposal relating to the one-off 100% payment of interim payment claims for a limited period and for the purpose of labour market policy measures. This was not accepted for a variety of reasons which were discussed in detail in the Committee on Regional Development. However, we must ask ourselves whether we have done enough to put in place what the Commission referred to in its communication of 3 June 2009 as a common commitment to employment which can be used to counteract the crisis. The objective was to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to help overcome the crisis and this is what we are discussing now. The European Structural Funds in particular are, as everyone knows, one of the main tools for investing in citizens and for combating the crisis and creating jobs. If we take a look at Europe, it becomes clear that the crisis has had a huge impact on the labour markets in the Member States and that action really is needed. There have been massive increases in unemployment, not only in the five countries, but in all the Member States, if we look at the situation in detail. In addition, unemployment also plays a major role independently of the crisis. In Europe, we have a very high level of unemployment which is still rising and is unrelated to the crisis. The alternative proposal submitted by the Commission certainly represents a step forward, which we welcome, because at least five Member States with a GDP that has fallen by 10% since 2008 will receive a relatively large subsidy. These Member States will benefit from this and from additional advance payments from the Cohesion and European Structural Funds. All of this is good, but we would like to see more being done. You know what our position is from what we have said in the committee. On the one hand, we are happy and, on the other hand, not so happy, but every step forward takes us forward too and this is where we should be going.

 Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, I think we believed that we had only a limited chance and therefore decided against it. I assume that my colleague thought the same thing. When I looked at the Commission’s overall initiative, I was thrilled. However, after long discussions on these subjects in the last few days, I have learnt a few things. I would have liked to see more. It is true that we could have submitted an amendment, you are right. However, if we are honest with one another, we know what will happen and this is why my group decided against an amendment. I must take note of that myself. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, thank you very much. We have two amendments, one of which is an amendment to the amendment. I would like to introduce both of them. We would like the words ‘the Council and’ to be deleted. The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be:  ‘calls on the Member States to refrain from forced repatriations of minorities if they face homelessness and discrimination in the areas of education, social protection and employment once they have been forcibly returned’.

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, in December 2009, when I was in Pristina and Mitrovica and saw how people are living in the Mahala and, in particular, in the lead-contaminated camps, I was rather shocked, particularly about the plight of the children. In almost every conversation I had, I was told that, not only in Kosovo, but also in many countries in Europe, the situation is dire for one of the oldest population groups in Europe, namely the Roma. I met Bekim Syla from the Roma and Ashkali Documentation Centre in Pristina, who received us with the words ‘We are tired of talking’. Action needs to be taken, and therefore our absolute highest expectation of the Córdoba Summit is that there will be more than mere talk and that action will be taken immediately. Immediate action means not resting on our laurels behind the EU directives implementing the principle of equal treatment, of equal treatment of persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, and also the Employment Framework Directive, because it will not do any good. Immediate action requires the recognition and assumption that these directives are not sufficient to protect the Roma in the European Union from degrading and discriminatory treatment and – most importantly – to enable their permanent integration. What we need, therefore, is a European Roma strategy that is a component of all policy areas – an integral component of all policies. However, the majority of governments implement projects that are merely sporadic measures. What we need are medium and long-term political initiatives. We urgently need measures for the economic development of the Roma communities. The EU must not wait until 2014 to make its structural and regional funding more flexible; it must do so now, so that the Roma can also benefit from it. This includes micro-credit loans, which need to be issued with as little bureaucracy as possible, for example, for the reconstruction of Roma settlements. It includes very specific measures for the promotion of health and for education, training and the development of the labour market. I would like to make it quite clear that no child should fail because of educational or language barriers. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left does not want Roma schools, but schools for everyone, where the Roma can also live and learn. I would like to add that this is not only about the money, but also about taking decisive measures to counter racism. Antiziganism must not be regarded as or remain a trivial offence, but must be punished as a crime. The EU bears a lot of the responsibility for the extent to which, it is to be hoped, we will soon succeed in bringing about justice for the more than 10 million Roma in Europe, because it starts with justice and should continue with equality. For this, we need a very clear political ‘yes’ and a resolute, powerful European framework strategy, and – quite frankly – it also needs our passionate commitment, as MEPs and as people, to this population group – the Roma and Sinti. Let us take action now. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, it is absolutely indisputable that body scanners quite clearly represent an invasion of privacy and a serious invasion at that. We need to ask ourselves two questions. The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism. We do not currently have any clear answers to this question. This is why I support what Mrs Malmström has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners. I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else. The second question concerns the risks to health. Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week. I would have to do so at least twice a week. This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health. No real assessments have been carried out in this area. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made. Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, human trafficking is, in reality, a scourge of the present day, and it feeds on poverty and ignorance. Its worst form is the trafficking of children, which is often linked to sexual abuse. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left believe that there is an urgent need for action on the Commission’s part. One of the most important prerequisites for successfully combating human trafficking is strengthening the rights of the victims. Only if this succeeds – and not only through punitive measures – can human trafficking be combated at all. That requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims. One of the things these victims need is effective protection and support before, during and also after criminal proceedings in which they testify as witnesses. This must be a high priority for the period of reconsideration, specifically, as well as where witness testimonies are retracted. Long-term witness protection programmes are urgently needed. Another thing that I think is important is that all victims of human trafficking, not just children, must be given free counselling. When dealing with children it is also necessary – coming back to this point – for it to be made possible to make use of child-specialist lawyers. There is a need for urgent measures to strengthen prevention, such as training for lawyers, the police, judges and counsellors. I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency intends to address this issue.

 Mr President, this is a central debate about the character of the European Union. The choice is between the market and social policy. The Commission’s current ideas about the future of the cohesion policy are unacceptable. The structural funds must be strengthened and not weakened. Europe must do more and not less to overcome economic and social differences in development. I would like to say quite openly that the renationalisation even of parts of the current cohesion policy would have a serious impact on disadvantaged regions, including those in Germany and, in particular, eastern Germany. After the last phase of enlargement of the European Union, the differences between the regions in the Union have increased. In addition, it is important to me that, in particular, socio-economic requirements in the regions which are just above the eligibility threshold of 75% of the EU average GDP per head are recognised. The sudden removal of subsidies after 2013 would be devastating for these regions. Of course, it is extremely important for specific subsidies for towns to be increased by the European Union, as this is where the major potential for the economy and finance lies, because the towns have been particularly hard hit by the crisis. I would like to say one last word about the border regions. As a Member of Parliament from eastern Germany, I know that we need to invest and achieve a great deal there. I am very concerned that the Commission will fail us in this respect. Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, today, after eight years, we all essentially know that the previous Afghanistan strategy based on military force has failed. The imbalance between military operations, on the one hand, and the insufficient resources for civil purposes, on the other, is directly preventing any improvement in the living conditions in Afghanistan. Thus, the most important message from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left is that we need a radical change of strategy. We need a radical change of strategy away from the military and, above all, towards a more people-centred strategy. Forty percent of Afghans are unemployed and more than half of them live in utter poverty without any health care or adequate education. The focus must be placed on the social issue, and that is what I expect from the Council, the Commission and all the actors involved here. This, of course, includes increasing good governance, strengthening agriculture and integrating former Taliban fighters. However, I say this to you most sincerely: if we only go half way to doing this and once again rely on military force, we will squander our chances. Time is running out! Cornelia Ernst,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will not be giving the resolution its backing. The Stockholm Programme completely fails to address the real challenges of the present day. Its main error is that a Europe of rights is being created to which EU citizens will be granted access but others who live in Europe will not. These other people will not be entitled to the same human and civil rights. The EU wants to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights – something that we welcome – yet, at the same time, migrants are to be separated out according to the ‘legal or illegal’ principle. Frontex is therefore being tooled up to wage war on so-called illegal migration, completely obscuring the idea of an unprejudiced immigration policy from view. This is where Stockholm fails. Another problem is the complete imbalance between freedom and security. It is true that there is no freedom without security, but it is also the case that there is no security without freedom. Freedom is not something to be negotiated, it is a universal right for every human being. Stockholm, in contrast, symbolises the EU’s manic lust for security, in which giant supranational databases are to be created without adequate opportunities for control, which will then mix intelligence service and police data on a pan-European basis. This will mean the shredding of people’s right to self-determination in relation to their data and that the vision of a see-through human being will actually be the reality. Allow me, as an MEP from eastern Germany, to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vehemently reject the measures being taken by the Federal Republic of Germany to deport Roma and other minorities to Kosovo. Soon, around 2 500 people are to be deported per year. These measures particularly affect 10 000 Roma, but also Egyptians and Ashkali. Many of these people have lived in Germany for over a decade, having found shelter there from displacement, persecution and violence. People are also beginning to be deported from Austria, Belgium, Hungary and France. I oppose these deportations because the situation of minorities in Kosovo, especially the Roma, is unbearable. The unemployment rate in this group stands at almost 100% and in Kosovo there is no way of providing these people with decent accommodation. Their prospects involve either life in a camp or lead-polluted Mitrovica. Finally, I would also like to appeal to the responsibility that Germany has, as a result of its history, to the victims of the Second World War, including the Roma and Sinti who were persecuted and systematically murdered. A certain level of responsibility that must also be taken in this case … (The President cut off the speaker) Cornelia Ernst  (GUE/NGL

 I generally believe that exemptions from and relaxation of visa rules are positive moves for the coexistence of peoples and for improving cooperation between countries. For the Western Balkans, in particular, it is important that all the countries of the region should be granted such a prospect. I therefore very much welcome the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are to be included in these regulations. Visa exemption for some must not be to the detriment of other citizens of the Western Balkans, however. That would be the case if only Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats were able to enjoy exemption from the visa requirement while Bosnian Muslims were not. I also argue in favour of medium-term solutions for Kosovo. In so doing, I would point out that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and does not have any status under international law. That does not relieve us of the obligation to consider how this state and its citizens are to be dealt with in future, however. Cornelia Ernst,

Madam President, first I should like to say that we do not share the concerns of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is perfectly simple: we believe that further development towards SIS II is not necessary and is politically wrong. We take this view for three reasons: firstly, because it mixes secret service and police data, giving rise to a data system that no longer guarantees controllability and in which personal data is not, in fact, protected. The second is biometric data, which is being anchored here as a large-scale experiment and, thirdly, SIS II is, of course, to be used against so-called illegal immigration. Hence our proposal: as we all know, we have SIS I. We consider it reasonable to develop this further ‘as one for all’
. It is a pragmatic approach, even if we are strongly criticised for it. However, we believe that, with the approach being pursued here, nothing more can be done. To put it simply: SIS II is a de facto
 failure and to keep on crawling round it – to put it one way – is meaningless. What is important is that money which is being put to the wrong use here should be saved, which will mean we have fewer problems with the whole thing and can stop worrying about the delay with SIS II. I say this also from the point of view of Saxony, a region of Germany close to Poland and the Czech Republic. I know full well here that it would certainly make more sense to do something towards stabilisation within the police than to introduce something like this. Cornelia Ernst,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a new MEP, let me start by saying that human rights issues are also extremely important to my party, the German Left, and that we condemn any violation of human rights – irrespective of where or by whom they are committed. That has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs. I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that, time and again, human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered. Natalia Estemirova, Stanislav Markelov, Zarema Sadulayeva, these are examples of murders that are truly shocking. It is therefore important that we in this House concern ourselves with this issue. I am concerned that cases like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya are not investigated. If this process is now re-opened, I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested, because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind. What we expect is simply for an immediate and full investigation to be carried out into these murders and for this matter to be dealt with ruthlessly, for Russia not to wait any longer but to take up the fight to protect human rights itself. It must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death. I also believe that the forthcoming EU-Russia summit needs to tackle these issues as a matter of urgency, and not merely as side issues, but with the prominence that they deserve. Personally, I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this House. I would have preferred not to debate issues such as these on Thursday afternoon and I believe this topic should also concern us even if it was about enterprise and trade. Such issues are often given secondary priority. That is what we want to change and that is also something I wanted to say here. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in the light of yesterday’s debate and with a clear look towards Ukraine, I would suggest that we clearly state that it is the right of the Ukrainian people to decide on their future without any international intervention. Therefore, I suggest replacing Amendment 1 with the following wording: ‘underlines the fact that it is for the Ukrainian people – and only for them – to decide, free from foreign interference, on the geopolitical orientation of the country and on which international agreements and communities Ukraine should join’. I suggest that the sentence should be added as a new last sentence to paragraph 19. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Commissioner, thank you. I want to thank all participating colleagues, in particular the rapporteurs and the team involved in negotiating the result. I also want specially to thank the NGOs and civil society which have ensured that pressure from outside Parliament encouraged us to take up the responsibility in this directive, in particular the NGO Publish What You Pay, because of their struggle for the items included in our directive. But they have achieved only the first step. Ecological and employment criteria form part of the responsibility we have to take into account. We also want to recognise that the requirement of country-by-country reporting of taxes and other financial data by companies in all sectors has to be included, and I guess that the discussion is just now under way among Member States and the Commission about extending  financial transparency to all sectors, as I have already said earlier, especially to tackle the widespread tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance that costs governments billions of euros each year and which belongs to the theme we have been discussing here.

Mr President, even though it is late, this is a matter on which we are doubtless all agreed: investments are important. The rule of law is a central prerequisite for the flow of investments. Ensuring compliance with the law, however, is a task for the courts.  Commissioner, you want to ensure, in binding national agreements between the EU and third countries, the right for investors to take action against governments, leaving judgment to trade specialists to whom environmental or other social interests do not matter. With this law you deprive the governments of the Member States of the right to defend their own political majority decisions, such as the withdrawal from nuclear energy. You even want to be able to force them to relinquish their position and take over the position of the Commission. What is the point then in having elections?  Internationally the number of such lawsuits has increased more than tenfold to nearly 500 at this moment in time. It is a mighty billion-dollar arbitration industry in its own right. On average we are talking about USD 8 million in legal costs and over USD 100 million in compensation claims per case. This law creates the foundations for the plundering of the European Union and its Member States by specialised law firms and corporations. From which budget line do you want to pay for lost lawsuits? That is not clear, and we have to discuss the whole issue at length. I also want to thank the rapporteur; while we were discussing the report, we established that this question is still open and on the table. I would also like to expand on the third question we raised. Companies in the European Union have to go via the ordinary courts, but you wish to enable investors from the outside to make use of the State method, which provides for far greater sums and compensation for damages. Do you intend to encourage companies to establish a branch abroad and then sue the EU or its Member States as an external plaintiff? A recent study concludes that in the text foreseen on the agreement with Canada, the CETA agreement, the wording on the table enables exactly this procedure, and legal action could soon be started against us, for example regarding the legislation prohibiting or regulating fracking.  I therefore cannot agree to the proposed bill and we will probably reject it, but I would like to receive certain answers to the questions we raised. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, I want to stress very clearly that the disappearance of Sombath Somphone is a most worrying example of the practice of arbitrary arrest by elements of the police. The world is watching this case very closely. I urge the Government of Laos to do its utmost to find and release Sombath Somphone. I call on High Representative Lady Ashton to make it absolutely clear that the outcome of this case will be a benchmark for the rule of law in Laos and that it will be crucial for the judgment on whether or not Laos qualifies for an enhancement in our relations, including trade relations. I welcome the fact that our colleagues from the ASEAN parliaments have already undertaken a fact-finding mission to Laos and I call on the ASEAN Human Rights Commission to set up immediately a committee to investigate the events surrounding the enforced disappearance of Sombath Somphone.  Finally, we will be watching closely in future because Laos has to understand that we will make the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as environmental and labour standards, a precondition for further relations between us and them.

Mr President, yesterday we had a very sensitive, emotional debate on the trade agreement on Colombia and Peru. It was a controversial issue for several political groups. My group will therefore ask Parliament to withhold its consent today and send the agreement back to the Committee on International Trade, for three main reasons which I have circulated to Members, and you can read in your mailboxes. Firstly, we have a study which explains that there is no provision to control and monitor financial flows in the agreement with Colombia and Peru, the two biggest coca exporters, whereas there are such provisions in other FTAs. On the one hand, the agreement seeks to close the window for tax evasion, tax fraud and money laundering, while on the other hand, it opens doors wide open to similar activities. The second reason is the human rights situation. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and several trade unions have explained that the human rights situation is not such that we should consent to the conclusion of this agreement.  Thirdly, the trade unions, ETUC and other such organisations are asking us not to give our consent. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Jörg Leichtfried. In my view, he has succeeded in devising a way forward which all the groups can support. I know from experience that the negotiations that lie ahead will not be easy, especially as a number of Member States have what I can only describe as an allergic reaction to the issue of delegated acts. Despite the lip service paid in fine speeches to the importance of the European Parliament and how it should be granted more powers, these same government representatives are refusing to recognise Parliament’s equal role to the Council, as an legislator with equal rights, when it comes to amending the legislative procedure. As a legislator, however, we are prepared to delegate powers to the Commission in specific cases, subject to a limit in time, while retaining a right of veto.  The Council is no longer the only institution to sit at the table with the Commission. I therefore urge the Council to stop dragging its feet. Due to this issue, we have already lost far too much time on a number of important dossiers. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, in my view, we should give very careful consideration to the causes and the effect. We are in danger of taking a very short-sighted view of complex economic and social developments and, with populist actions, unleashing a trade war with China. That is the last thing the European Union needs at present! Yes, we need fair trade and fair production, but what has actually happened? As a result of cutbacks in the support schemes in Germany and other countries, the photovoltaic market was artificially constricted, resulting in increased competition. If this triggers a major dispute at the political level, we jeopardise the trade links of manufacturers of polysilicon, as well as putting exports in other sectors at risk. We also jeopardise the global supply of technologies that we urgently need for the transformation of our energy systems. Mr Jadot has already highlighted the challenges associated with renewable energies. Our discussions about the EU budget and the positions of the EU Member States on drastic budget cuts also have implications for the issue that is the subject of this debate. We cannot achieve a solution through confrontation. We can only do so through cooperation. I would therefore urge the Commission to make arrangements as soon as possible, as time is really pressing, for a joint forum for European, US and Chinese manufacturers and to support networking between developers, producers and distributors in these three key regions.

Madam President, Commissioner, 92.72727 % was the result celebrated by President Lukashenko’s associates in the most recent parliamentary elections. Otherwise, everything is following an all-too-familiar pattern: the election observers deliver their detailed verdict on the obviously-not-free-and-fair nature of the elections, we adopt our motion for a resolution and the Council imposes a few more sanctions or extends the existing ones. Beyond the Bug, the new parliament remains without an opposition and, therefore, exempt from criticism and correction, while those who want to see a different Belarus are still excluded, persecuted or locked up. The daily lives of Belarusians are still governed by the arbitrariness of politics and the greed of oligarchs.  In the description and assessment of this development, there is barely anything to choose between the political groups of this House. I also believe that nobody expected any other result or any changes to take place in Belarus. However, if that is true, then I must, at this point, reiterate the doubts I have already expressed on repeated occasions. Sanctions appear to be ineffective as a tool. They have not previously had any serious impact, either in Belarus or elsewhere.  Mr Füle has spoken again on the EU’s current activities as regards Belarus. We consider much of that to be worthwhile, such as the direct engagement with civil society under the European dialogue on modernisation. The problem with these activities, however, is that they fail to address Belarusians in their specific circumstances as consumers and workers. People want to discuss the job market, not industrial relations, co-determination rights or compliance with International Labour Organisation or environmental standards and so on. However, if these sessions are not used to tackle the issues of social justice faced on both sides of the Bug, then the foundations of the autocratic system undeniably still in place in Belarus will barely shake.  I would like to conclude with the following point: when we lived in a divided Europe, it was extremely important that, in spite of all the criticism levelled at those in power, a line of communication was kept open. Historically, we have shifted from sanctions to dialogue. It seems to me that, at present, we are moving in the opposite direction. In view of the obvious ineffectiveness of this policy, the question is: what do we do when we have exhausted all the options, when we have tightened the last thumbscrew? It is better to begin to confront the political leaders of Belarus with our arguments and demands in the context of political dialogue. That requires the EU Member States to cast aside their contradictory policy. The use of sanctions against repressive states does nothing to alter the repressive system of the State in question.

Madam President, Commissioner, as we discuss – not for the first time – the accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the Russian Federation, it is easy to forget that trade with the Russian Federation is, and in my opinion will continue to be, of strategic relevance to Europe because there is so much of it and because of the direction it is taking.  I would like to respond to the report by Mr Sturdy, since he examines the status of the relationship with the Russian Federation from economic perspectives, taking Russia’s accession to the WTO, after years of negotiation, as the reference point. I am grateful to the permanent rapporteur for trade negotiations with the Russian Federation for not allowing himself to ignore troubling news about social conflicts, increasingly arbitrary behaviour by the authorities and new, ambivalent legal situation in Russia, but for sticking soberly to the facts.  There are policy areas that cannot just be subsumed under the logic and dynamism of foreign policy. We have talked about this here several times before. Parliament should also form policy with a view to economic cooperation and create trade relations independently of political trends. I welcome the fact that the Commission representatives here in Parliament recently made a commitment to guarantee the stability of this relationship and, as a consequence, to take the Russian leadership at its word regarding the modernisation of the country and its interest in having the EU at its side as a partner. One of the major lessons of the earlier conflicts in Europe is that rapprochement brings change. Mutual rapprochement works in the 21st century but only on an equal footing and through joint efforts. Trade is not an instrument for this rapprochement but does have exactly this effect. This change, which, along with further economic cooperation, we feel is justified, should have as its aim a movement towards greater social justice, less poverty, greater democracy, obviously greater rule of law and thus respect for human rights. We know that the rule of law without democracy – or vice versa – does not work. However, greater democracy without greater social justice, greater application of trade union rights, international labour norms, environmental standards, etc. is even worse. This also applies to the serious consideration of the impacts of the Russian Federation’s accession to the WTO, which in the medium term are not easy to predict, on jobs in industry, the service sector and elsewhere.  I believe we should also take a fresh look at trade barriers. What is really preventing trade with Russia at present is not only trade barriers as we define them but also the continued existence of the visa requirement. The statements at the EU-Russia summit in this regard read well but have not added anything of substance yet. We ought to change this. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an intelligent agreement between the EU and Japan would lead to stronger integration of the two economies. It goes without saying that 128 million potential customers in high-wage Japan offer very attractive prospects for European companies and their workforces in a range of sectors. Mutual integration of know-how in production chains could improve the global competitiveness of thousands of supplier companies. As you hear, I am using the subjunctive, because both your report this evening, Commissioner De Gucht, and important paragraphs in the EP resolution now before us make no offer of partnership; rather, they make unilateral demands to Japan. In my view, that is not a good starting point for long-term cooperation that brings mutual benefits. What we are discussing this evening is the mandate for the negotiations. I am in favour of a clear, frank and open-ended discussion of the differences between the EU and Japan around the negotiating table. A real partnership cannot be based on either side dictating terms. That is why, as a Group, we have problems with the text of the resolution. Let us have a look at it. There are large chunks of the text that appear to have been written by the car industry. At a time when we are facing a climate crisis, how can we seriously demand a commitment from the Japanese Government to abolish the special treatment for electric and hybrid vehicles and the concessions for micro vehicles such as Kei-Cars
, just so that we can export more diesel-powered vehicles? The resolution’s over-emphasis on the abolition of non-tariff measures also conflicts with the findings of the Copenhagen study on trade between the EU and Japan. This study recognises that many of these measures help to improve general welfare, especially in the fields of health, the environment and consumer protection. We should therefore look at what the proposed arrangements are intended to achieve and seek an outcome which brings benefits to society but still promotes trade. Furthermore, companies surveyed have mentioned other reasons why they are deterred from investing in Japan. Above all, there is the language barrier, cultural differences, which also affect consumer preferences, high taxes and wage costs. Anyone who is reluctant to pay qualified translators, or to develop successful marketing strategies to promote their goods in Japan, or to pay local wages and taxes should invest at home instead. These types of trade barrier cannot and should not be removed by an agreement. In this context, the Committee on International Trade gained some very interesting insights last year into the strategy pursued by IKEA, a very large company that has tailored its operations to suit Japanese consumption patterns, culture and social standards. We need an agreement with non-tariff elements of cooperation. Joint programmes can bring together businesses and trade unions, consumer associations, academics, administrators and young people from Europe and Japan. Let us work towards a new culture of cooperation. That would also bring practical benefits for Europe’s SMEs in terms of energy efficiency and high-tech cooperation. Helmut Scholz,

Mr President, Commissioner De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a proposal from you, Commissioner, that has the potential to do enormous damage to Europe’s reputation. While our partners are still engaged in negotiations with the Commission, you are looking to put a gun to their heads, forcing them to capitulate under the threat of exclusion from the European market. Your approach has completely discredited the European Union as a partner in negotiations. Ambassadors from all the relevant countries have vividly described to me what is at stake for them and their population. The Committee on Development, armed with excellent and reliable barometers of mood in the African partner states, has recognised this and has therefore completely rejected the Commission’s proposal in the statement from my colleague and group chair Gabi Zimmer. My group is strongly supportive of this position, even in view of the trade-related aspects. I would call on all Members of this House, including my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, to take this development policy perspective to heart and not to risk decades of close cooperation because of a short-sighted unilateral decision by the Commissioner for Trade. We will have a roll-call vote. Commissioner De Gucht, your regulation would be devastating for the East African community. You risk isolating Kenya from the other Member States or causing this association of states to wave goodbye to Europe as its most important partner. A number of trading nations around the world would be happy at this development. You have made an unjust accusation against the Africans. You are seeking to punish a delay for which you yourself are responsible. Why, for example, is the Commission insisting on abolishing export taxes? Namibia only levies such taxes on raw materials exports. If primary processing takes place in Namibia itself, no taxes are payable. I see this as smart and legitimate economic policy, pointing the way for an industrial policy that is completely in line with the objectives of EU development policy. Commissioner, you are taking a very short-sighted approach that runs counter to the medium- and long-term interests of Europe and the expansion of its trade relations. I would call on you to withdraw your proposal. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe have been discussing the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) for months, as we also have here in this House. They came to the conclusion that they do not want or need ACTA. They are concerned that ACTA represents a threat to their freedom in the digital world. They are also worried about issues of central data protection. We have learnt during the course of this debate that the Internet has brought a new dimension to democracy and to our lives. It has become an important aspect of the way in which democracy in the European Union functions, particularly over recent weeks and months. The citizens are pinning all their hopes on the European Parliament and relying on it to defend their interests against the Commission, which has negotiated this agreement, Mr De Gucht, with a mandate from the Council over a period of six years. Two years ago, we insisted that more transparency was needed and we succeeded in bringing the secret ACTA negotiations into the light of day. Now we must not postpone this debate. We must come to a decision. We do not need to wait for the Court of Justice of the European Union, because this concerns the content of the agreement, as other Members have already said. We must decide now. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about a quite different dimension. We must all work together to bring about change. We live in an age when the ways in which information and knowledge are used are becoming increasingly separated from the concept of private property. We need to develop new structures that will equate to a new legal culture concerning the access to and use of content. Children must acquire an understanding of this area in school. This is the content of the debate about ACTA and it also applies to the debate about the future development of patents, copyright, international trade and economic cooperation in a multilateral and networked world. We also need to discuss this on a multilateral basis with China, Brazil and many other countries within the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and to come to an agreement about it. Mr De Gucht, I believe that you are not certain about or fully aware of the revolutionary impact of the Internet. In the case of ACTA, you are continuing to defend a business model from a period in the past when most people still went to a shop to buy records. At that time, it was mainly big non-European companies such as Sony that were making large amounts of money and they treated their artists as if they owned them.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is not just the European Union that is experiencing economically difficult times. Japan, too, finds itself in a long struggle, which was made even worse by the disaster last year. The EU’s trade agreement with South Korea, a direct competitor of Japan, put the government and businesses of that country under pressure, and that also affects the jobs and overall social situation in Japan. However, while many European governments are often quickly enthused by agreements with developing countries, as these are always negotiated to the advantage of European businesses and investors, the conservatives – including in this House – are currently applying the brakes to the talks with Japan. Aware of Japan’s dire straits, some are even calling for the Japanese to kowtow before real negotiations can take place. Ladies and gentlemen, friends prove themselves in times of trouble. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be ill-advised – as certainly all of us in this House would be, too – to categorise Japan as a beggar now, rather than a partner. The dispute about non-tariff barriers to trade is also something that we should resolve eye-to-eye at the negotiating table. In those negotiations, our aim should not be to cut as many laws as possible that our trading partner has developed. We need to analyse the regulations in dispute based on their purpose and aim in order to achieve a result that provides the social benefit required but which, at the same time, favours the trade of products, without, for example, reducing levels of consumer protection or environmental targets. In addition, we also take very seriously the concerns of Japanese farmers, who see their livelihoods threatened by future European agricultural exports. Similarly, there must be no agreement if the interests of the people of Europe are not safeguarded. My group will certainly not vote in favour of any treaty in which the investment protection chapter grants companies a right of action against governments or the EU.

 Thank you, Mr Caspary. In response to your first question, I do believe it very likely that all or many of the groups jointly submitted this draft resolution. Nonetheless, the questions I asked are of pressing interest, including because they are accepted and considered not merely by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but by all the groups. That is why I pointed out that we need to make progress here with the negotiations. In that regard, it needs to be more than just scoping. We need to go a step further and, as Mr Lange said, also incorporate this consideration when issuing the mandate. The answers to the second and third questions I will provide to Mr Caspary in person.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with this compromise, the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Fjellner, are asking for Parliament’s consent for a reform that would abolish the European Union’s trade preferences for a number of poor countries. This fact is concealing itself behind the debate about the criteria into which we have already entered, including today. A completely arbitrary limit value has been set on per capita average income, which just happens to exceed USD 4 000 per annum. However, this value tells us nothing about the real distribution of income in many countries. In particular, the inconsistency of development processes in each country is not covered. Do you recall the Treaty of Lisbon? The elimination of poverty is a coherent goal of the foreign policy of the European Union. Your reform will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in countries like Ecuador, thus tipping women, predominantly, back into poverty. I believe that the motivation is clear, and it has even been publicly acknowledged by the rapporteur. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Fjellner for his openness and the mutual respect shown during the debate on this. Countries such as Ecuador are to be forced to conclude a direct free trade agreement with the European Union. We have seen the simple peddling of the argument that the reform aims to help the least developed countries. You are aware of that yourself, as trade potentials will not shift to the weak, but to the strong. Mr Lange, every major development organisation, this House’s Committee on Development, as well as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and numerous national trade unions have leant their support to the amendments and the trend through which we are seeking to revise this regulation. We will bring these amendments up again with Members in plenary, and I strongly urge you to support these amendments and thus help ensure that the European Union does not withdraw from the global fight against poverty.

– Mr President, the Policy Department’s study ‘EU macro-financial assistance: a critical assessment’ provides a useful and telling assessment of MFA operations so far. It shows the impact of both the scope and the volume of the loans and grants to be very marginal in many cases. The new procedures under the Treaty of Lisbon make the process of applying MFA more cumbersome. The consent of Parliament is now necessary for all applications of the MFA, and we understand the willingness of the Commission to simplify the procedures. Mr Kazak – whom I thank, on my own behalf and that of our shadow rapporteur, for his cooperation – proposes to apply the delegated acts procedure in respect of eligible countries and granting assistance to particular countries. As a group, we support this view. Our group is not against the imposition of some conditions but they must be the right ones. Our group considers it a serious mistake to continue to impose, within the framework of the MFA, the same conditions imposed by the IMF. We need to address these challenges, in particular in the light of the current financial and economic crisis. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our citizens are increasingly losing confidence in the European Union and the application of the law practised by its policies in many areas, Mr Martin’s own-initiative report can only be welcomed, and I would like to expressly lend my group’s support to this own-initiative report. It concerns taking further practical steps to assert the right explicitly laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Parliament’s task of exercising political control. I therefore do not agree with the previous speaker that we should not expand the right of inquiry or the rights of the European Parliament in this way, for how can and should Article 226 intervene in practice, in concrete terms, if it becomes necessary to set up temporary committees of inquiry in order to uncover and put a stop to, and I quote:  ‘alleged contraventions or maladministration in the implementation of Union law’. (DE)
 We need a permanent inquiry procedure that functions in real terms, is transparent and creates transparency. Inquiry proceedings do indeed have an important role to play in a parliamentary democracy. They allow parliaments to examine the facts independently and autonomously where they consider this necessary in order to perform their constitutional task of representing citizens. I believe this to be urgently necessary, particularly in the situation which the European Union finds itself at present. One final thought to close: I agree with those Members who have said that minority conclusions are urgently needed. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the coming week, the Chinese Minister for Commerce, Chen Deming, will be holding official talks with Mr De Gucht in Brussels. In this respect, this debate is taking place at the right time and the Chinese will be paying considerable attention to the expectations and opinions of the European Parliament. Ms de Sarnez, despite the constructive cooperation and the many individual points in your report which were correct and which I would like to thank you for, I cannot vote in favour of your report. Everyday life in businesses in Europe, the closure of traditional manufacturing plants, for example, in the textile industry and in the new industries of the future, such as the solar sector, the supply of raw materials to both these huge markets, the challenges involved in global trade and the complexity of current economic policy, in particular against the background of the financial, economic and structural crisis, the challenges of climate change and the current logic of production and growth all show that the report falls short of what we would like to see. We are taking too small a step, even if we perhaps do not need a new major leap forwards. We cannot simply continue our trade and economic policy as before with China and with other so-called emerging markets. We must investigate our business relations, address the contradictions and problems openly and establish clear contractual terms. However, all of this can only take place in the context of developing a common, agreed strategy for cooperation in a genuinely globalised world economy. To achieve this, we need intelligent, forward-looking initiatives. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Aung San Suu Kyi, one of the most symbolic political figures in the world, is once again taking part in the process of shaping her country. The overwhelming support which she received during her election to parliament clearly demonstrates that she carries the hopes of the Burmese people. However, I would like to make it clear that the parliament to which she was elected does not have the power to take the country in a different direction from that planned by the military. In addition, the generals have adopted a constitution which guarantees that they retain control over parliament in future. President Thein Sein could give a clear indication of how serious his desire for change is by not attempting to force the newly elected members to swear to support this obsolete constitution before they are allowed to take up their mandate. I am happy to acknowledge that a series of positive changes have taken place over the last two years. However, I agree with all my fellow Members that the country still has a long way to go. The spotlight on Aung San Suu Kyi must not blind us to the fate of other political prisoners, to the ongoing military action against parts of the population, to the misery of the refugees and to the wealth of a small elite in a desperately poor country. Is real change now on the way or will there be new setbacks? My group supports the call from Aung San Suu Kyi to suspend EU sanctions, but not to lift them permanently. This would give her country the opportunity to overcome poverty and encourage the military to continue along the road to democracy. However, it would also allow us to show that the European Parliament remains vigilant and that a return to dictatorship would have serious consequences. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Füle, my group has been following the developments in Iceland over the last few years and the ongoing and intensive accession negotiations with great attention and sympathy. We see Iceland primarily from the perspective of a country with a very small population which has not only succeeded in bringing about social change in recent years, but has also drawn conclusions about how to resolve the causes of the crisis and taken the necessary measures. We believe that Iceland is very much on the right track. Therefore, my group is also asking itself whether Iceland can bring its experiences, for example, in the area of sustainable energy policy, into the accession process and ultimately into Europe. Some of the solutions it has put in place go far beyond the measures taken to overcome the crisis in the EU. That is what the accession negotiations are essentially about. This presupposes that the negotiations are not only transparent and constructive, but are also on an equal footing as far as their content is concerned and do not have a predetermined outcome. Some of my fellow Members would like to believe that the domestic political situation in Iceland and the accession process are not efficient in political terms. However, the key political consideration is something quite different. The population of Iceland, which, by the way, is very pro-European, because many Icelanders have studied and worked in Europe, has high expectations of the negotiations. Nevertheless, the people of Iceland do not want accession at any price. In the end, they have to weigh up the results. This is a highly democratic process which we should welcome and support. I would like to thank Mr Preda for his very balanced report, but on the basis of these considerations, my group will be abstaining from voting. Why is this? Against the background of what I have said, the report contains points that we cannot support. Two examples of these are that if we accept, as my group does, that the accession process will remain open until the final evaluation of the results of the negotiations, we cannot behave now as if the decision had already been made. Secondly, the report calls in paragraph 5 for a reduction in the state’s influence on the banking sector. However, Iceland had particular challenges to overcome in this area, which we must not ignore. Instead, we must assess what has been done and make use of the findings. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address my words expressly to Mr Swoboda. Your first motion for a resolution was pleasantly balanced and specifically unemotional with regard to what can be said following the presidential elections. In signing the European Convention on Human Rights, the Russian leadership made a voluntary commitment that it is not fulfilling. These elections, too, were once again not fair or free of fraud. Even a EUR 300 million investment in surveillance technology by the government did not solve a problem that can only be solved at a political level. These are the sober facts that do not leave us, as a partner, indifferent. They also highlight the contradictory nature of a Russian society, which, as everyone can see, is nevertheless changing. This is something we should welcome and support, because emerging democracies thrive on efforts to develop and change, and also on protests. Russia is becoming normal. I therefore consider a number of the conclusions drawn by some of my colleagues here in Parliament to be politically wrong. There must be no compromises in the text here, either. This House must finally decide what line it wants to take. At the ‘Russia after the Elections’ event yesterday, organised by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I discovered that some Members are of the opinion that Russia is no longer normal. Was it ever normal? They believe it represents a potential danger and that we cannot simply carry on as before, but must now finally take a different course. I would just like to say something about this. Those who want to think in terms of escalation spirals should now explain how far they want to go with this and, moreover, not only in terms of where that leaves our partnership. For all the justified criticism and all of the differences, partnership for me means, above all, a balance in terms of our common interests, and, at least in my mother tongue, partnership and subordination are not synonyms. People who advocate this path are also saying, as far as I can see, that they do not believe in the power of society to change and that they have not taken note of the changes in Russian society, to which, incidentally, the reports of the election observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) also refer, as here is where alternatives to the Putin-steered democracy are being sought. All of this must, ultimately, be discussed in political terms. The dynamism that some people are currently developing here in this House following the elections is something that I consider to be disconcerting, however. In my view, it cannot be reconciled with the political dignity and self-perception of a House that stands for plurality in Europe if representatives of part of the Russian opposition here in Strasbourg were able, unchallenged, to discredit the alternative presidential candidates by describing them simply as ‘Putin’s pigs’, when these candidates, without rectification of the election fraud, received the vote of more than 25 million citizens in Russia. Despite knowledge to the contrary, these same people have been speaking for weeks in this House, likewise unchallenged, of the possible bloodshed caused by Mr Putin and of potential revolutions. All I can say is that it is not the clear majority in this House that is deliberately taking the wrong course in its criticism of the elections in Russia. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, it is important that on the second occasion in only a short period of time, the European Parliament is condemning the abuse of children who are used as cheap labour or slaves. We are in favour of this agreement. Nevertheless, in the Committee on International Trade, we had a shameful debate about whether we should condemn only forced child labour or also child labour under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In two areas, we may be forced to take a step backwards and, therefore, we need to resolve the issues involved. Mr Sturdy, recital E, which has been tabled by your group, gives the impression that the hard work done by children on the cocoa plantations is harmless. These children are being deprived of the opportunity to take part in education and their future is being taken away from them. We should delete this paragraph. Ms Köstinger and the other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which tabled recital D, want Parliament to turn a blind eye to the fact that children are being abducted and sold in West Africa to do hard and dangerous forced labour on the cocoa plantations. This is the appalling reality in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in particular, as has already been mentioned. I recommend that you watch the documentary ‘The Dark Side of Chocolate’, which reveals that a child costs EUR 230. The children are being abducted from Mali and the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are more than 12 000 children without relations working on the Ivorian plantations. The next time we eat chocolate, we should specifically ask ourselves how many children have suffered to give us this pleasure. We must take a much more decisive approach to combating this problem.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, discussions between the partners about what annoys them and about what changes would increase the common ground between them are an undoubted part of strategic partnerships. More than one area of this kind exists. Therefore, it is increasingly surprising that this House is content simply to give a mutual confirmation of its values. The results of the poll in Russia yesterday should be making us think much more carefully about the situation. The poll showed that the Russian population wants a modern country with a stable economy which is more than just an exporter of raw materials. However, only 7% of the population believes that the EU is prepared to help with the necessary reconstruction. This figure has not only halved, but is also particularly low in areas which are in close contact with the EU. We should be discussing the related issues here, including democratic values, involvement in society, the prospects of the election and the emergence of a political and civil society in the Russian Federation, particularly against the background of the contradictory experiences of the Russian people during the Yeltsin era. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, a strategic partnership must involve a balance of interests on key issues, including people’s living conditions, business relationships based on equal opportunities and the joint challenges that we have to resolve. ‘Strategic’ means giving priority to our common interests as part of this balance. It also means making concrete achievements, ensuring that the political decision-making processes are transparent for everyone, and explaining the electoral procedures. We agree on the fact that nothing can happen without joint security. However, it is difficult to understand why joint security is not being established jointly. The proposals for discussion have been put on the table, including by the EU. The next summit must deal with these proposals. It must come to a binding agreement that the money used to buy more weapons would be better spent on the specific processes for establishing the modernisation partnership. This is in the interest of both sides and also in the interest of our citizens, who want to have their fair share of the economic progress. A prospering economy and a fair society will ultimately make obsolete the arrogant behaviour which comes with power. A society of this kind needs the competence and commitment of all its citizens. The Russian demonstrators made this clear to their government in Bolotnaya Square on Saturday and called for concrete change. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I took over this dossier, I quite honestly did not expect to be negotiating it intensively for more than two years. In my view, that is certainly difficult to explain to the general public, both to citizens within the EU and also to people in our partner countries. It is worth noting that, with regard to the negotiations on the actual content and the tasks of the instrument, it was possible to reach an agreement in a few months. What caused the negotiations to drag on so long was the interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon in respect of the delegated acts and the refusal of some large Member States to actually allow Parliament greater powers of scrutiny. The Council and the European Parliament agreed at an early stage to thoroughly revise the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries. We planned to release up to EUR 348 million for cooperation in the fields of science, academic exchanges – including the Erasmus Mundus programme – culture, environmental protection and renewable energy sources and the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration was to be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. That remains the case, but the delay has meant that it will only be possible for a considerably smaller amount to be invested by the end of the current financial framework. That is particularly regrettable because, with the new ICI+, projects in developing countries can also be financed, and this involves projects that do not fall within the general definition of development assistance measures, for example sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America. In the amended regulation we have made clear reference to the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It is clearly stated for whom and for what purpose the additional funds are to be used according to the intentions of the legislators. In the developing countries listed in Annex II, at least 5% of the funds are to be spent in the area of public diplomacy. In specific terms, that means the promotion of dialogue with civil society with regard to the character and fundamental values of the European Union, namely democracy, respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms. At least 20% of the funds are to be invested in the promotion of direct relations between the citizens of the European Union and the partner countries. In addition to an emphasis on academic exchange and the mobility of students, this also involves the interlinking of economic, social and cultural players. At least 50% of the funds are to be spent on the interlinking of economic activities, with the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. The funds are to go mainly to partner countries which comply with the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation and which are involved in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is a new element. With regard to cooperation in the energy sector, the Commission is in any case required to concentrate in particular on cooperation in the area of renewable energy. For the purpose of the minutes and for the information of the Commission and the supervisory authorities: this instrument is expressly not to be used to provide hidden subsidies for the operation of a European telephone company in Colombia or any other country in Latin America. I consider it extremely important and necessary to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. We in Parliament will continually monitor this. For this purpose, we have enshrined in this instrument a special reporting obligation on the part of the Commission – this is a success too. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulation is in line with the spirit of the legislators. In the past the Commission has unfortunately often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. We therefore wanted to enshrine the delegated acts in this instrument and to demand our role and duty as legislators with a right of veto. Therefore, in the interests of those who benefit from the support programme, we did not in the end insist on the relevant wording, but with this instrument as with all the others – and on this point I agree with the other rapporteurs – we will also fight for this democratic right in future too. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, I can only agree with Mr Goerens’s criticism of the Council, as I too would have very much liked to have seen the Council here today. Nevertheless, after all the fine words about compromise and also the areas of disagreement listed at the end of the debate, I would like to take the opportunity to point out once again that the Commission should now submit a completely revised strategy paper for the ICI+. It would be unacceptable for us as legislators to give the instrument a completely new direction and then for the Commission to simply continue with the old strategy paper, which was drawn up even before the legislative amendment and therefore had the old ‘Global Europe’ communication as its reference document. Instead, the legislators have given the regulation a completely new tenor, namely that of a partnership approach and mutual benefit. The legislators are placing the regulation in the context of other key policy goals of the European Union, in particular coherence with development policy, the enforcement of international labour law standards and the combating of climate change. However, the strategy paper continues to ignore this intention, maintaining that the goal of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. As legislators, that was not what we aimed to achieve with this instrument and the corresponding money from taxpayers. The ICI+ is intended to be a modern cooperation programme, not a weapon of conquest. Commissioner, in my view you still have an obligation to implement the will of the legislators in future, too. We do not want to write planning and strategy papers ourselves. We have repeatedly made that clear. That is something that the Commission should continue to do. However, we will utilise our right of veto if the requirements that we have written down have been ignored. Therefore, the proposals for the new generation of financing instruments must employ the principle of the delegated acts wisely. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few weeks there has at last been a positive signal from the US that has made the world sit up and listen. However, this signal did not come from the White House, nor from the Capitol, but from the street. With the Occupy movement, the American people have set an example of resistance against the dictates of financial capitalism that have been followed and seized upon throughout the world. Yesterday, the tents of the protesters were cleared away and numerous people were arrested by the police under the cover of darkness throughout the US in what was clearly a concerted action on the part of the mayors. That is also a signal, indicating the refusal of those in power to take up the demands of the people. However, this is precisely the demand that my group would make of a transatlantic summit. It is not the people who should be arrested, but the fraudsters who are becoming ever richer on profits from subprime credits. The summit, coming just after the G20 summit, ought to consider how wide the gap is now getting between the poor majority of the population and the super rich. The summit ought to take firm decisions concerning the prohibition of usurious interest, whether for private individuals or for entire states. It ought to open its eyes and see that 10% of the population of the United States and the Member States of the EU is now out of work. A quarter of young people have no prospects, and in many regions the figure is even higher than 40%. The financial markets suck the necessary investment capital out of the real economy and out of the national exchequers and deprive them of profits. These enormous problems must be addressed at the summit. To solve these problems we need a new high-quality partnership for cooperation between the US Congress, the European Parliament and the parliaments of the EU Member States in order to define common approaches for the legislation that is urgently needed. An expanded TLD would also be the appropriate forum for addressing further differences between the EU and the US, whether this is – using the list of topics that you mentioned – in peace policy, climate policy or in connection with rights to privacy. As Mr Bütikofer said, the resolution is a long way from achieving this. As a group, therefore, we cannot give the resolution our backing. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, like many of my fellow Members, I would also like to say that we need to be honest and admit that the central task for the Commission in 2012 is nothing less than holding together the European Union. We need to take a joint approach to developing it further. We need more Europe. We must stick together in the interest of the citizens and we must not allow individual Member States to be exposed to attacks from financial capitalism. However, more Europe must not mean less democracy. In 2012, we will undoubtedly have to lay the foundations for the future development of the European Union, which will perhaps come close to being a state. However, in this Europe which resembles a state, decisions must not be made by decree by the Council and the Commission. The groundwork carried out by the Commission for the convention in 2012 must not result in the citizens of Europe and their parliaments being disenfranchised. Instead, we need a more democratic Europe with a focus on peace, environmental change and social progress. Do you not realise, Mr Barroso, that you and the Commission are increasingly being regarded by the people of Greece, Portugal and Italy as their enemy? The Council has succeeded in making you the scapegoat. Brussels is ordering the privatisation of state assets, cuts in wages and pensions, and the removal of protection against dismissal. This is all pure neoliberalism. Stop, Mr Barroso! You must finally turn the Commission into the ally of the citizens. You must defend people against the effects of greed and join with us in 2012 in bringing an end to the business model that has driven entire states to the brink of ruin with extortionate interest rates. You must stop feeding the predators. Instead, you must channel the funds into urgently needed investments in the future and make the financial transaction tax your touchstone. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, what we are discussing here relates to international economic cooperation. We often discuss the financial crisis and rescuing the banks and the euro. Incredible sums of money have been made available that should have been enough to boost employment throughout the world and thereby conquer hunger. We talk far too little about the people whose real existence the crisis has hit. The banks that we are to rescue have driven millions of people into unemployment through their speculation whilst also, at the same time, irresponsibly gambling with people’s pension funds. With the American Jobs Act, President Obama is seeking to finally put the fate of these people back at the heart of politics. His idea of removing financial burdens from businesses that take on new employees is a good one. European policy should learn from the example that the United States is setting. The non-policy of strangling the life out of the economy through lunatic austerity measures must be brought to an end. In difficult times like these, I also give my firm backing to the use of public procurement resources to promote local production. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, whoever it is sitting over there, I urge you to use the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council in December to tackle the issue of unemployment in a concerted manner in this context and to prevent a downward spiral, while counselling a joint new start for economic, employment and social policy. Be sure that the European Parliament will be very actively involved in the transatlantic dialogue between legislators. The Occupy Wall Street movement has not only earned the support of millions of Americans; it will, I hope, also act as an inspiration for the population of Europe. Helmut Scholz,

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Caspary, I acknowledge the fact that, as rapporteur, you have shown yourself within your own group to be thoroughly open to the demand for a modern trade policy with this report. Paragraph 5 of your report in particular emphasises the fact, at last, that trade policy requires coherence with a great many other policy areas as well as future viability, and I expressly support your call for a thorough revision of the trade strategy by Commissioner De Gucht. Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of this report then falls back into the old way of thinking. You want to promote the interests of the EU instead of establishing partnerships. You support an aggressive market access strategy by the Commission, which would weaken the development potential of other countries. You want to use whatever means necessary to secure access to raw materials for European enterprises instead of finally offering fair prices and providing assistance for the development of manufacturing industries. We will vote against this old way of thinking, because the consequence of continuing with this old strategy will, above all, be the extension of the spiral of poverty in most parts of the world. That is short-sighted, also because it will ultimately harm Europe. How do you actually imagine it will end if we pursue competition for the raw materials of the world by aggressive means? Where will we be in 2050? Will all of the states in the world then have a raw materials management strategy like that of Norway? Will it have been possible to develop manufacturing industries? Will Europe have helped them to do this in an environmentally sound way and to create respectable jobs? Europe’s future lies in a smart trade policy that aims to strengthen its partners and which recognises that combating poverty is a prerequisite for its own survival. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I have a question for Commissioner De Gucht. I have just been appointed as a European Parliament standing rapporteur on trade relations with China, as well as on relations between the EU and Ecuador and Bolivia. I would like to ask you two questions regarding these two complexes. Firstly, what is your projection for the development of trade relations between the EU and China by the year 2020, and what are the current issues, or even agreements, in EU-China trade talks? Secondly, you informed yesterday’s Council on Foreign Affairs and Trade that the multiparty agreement with Colombia and Peru remains open for signature by Ecuador and Bolivia. Do you want those two countries to simply sign the negotiated text which is, as you well know, subject to well-founded criticism from trade unions and a number of economists? Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL
).  
– I can agree with your remark concerning the last issue, but that means that if Ecuador wants to have a chapter on trade and cooperation included, as is just now under discussion, and also the specific needs of the new raw materials and public services policy pursued by Bolivia are to be included, then I think we have to come to the point where we have to add this point to the negotiations as well; so not just to simply sign or not sign, but to reopen the understanding of the agreement itself.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this agreement, as a result of which Palestinian agricultural products will now actually be placed on an equal footing with products from other, recognised states in the Mediterranean. I expressly agree with the rapporteur – and I would like to thank her for her work – when she says that this Agreement can help, to a certain degree, to support and strengthen the Palestinian economy, which is currently in crisis, irrespective of the aspects of this Agreement that are still unresolved, to which my fellow Members have referred. How is a permanent peace solution with Israel to be possible if there is no self-supporting economic development in the future state of Palestine, which also is and must be the basis for further democratisation and an embedding of Palestinian society in the region as a whole – I would like to emphasise this point – for dealing with such complex problems as demographic issues, job creation, issues relating to water supply, the construction of housing, and so on, in a constructive and positive way? I also see this as an important signal in view of the current debate in the United Nations with regard to the long overdue recognition of the state of Palestine. Trade policy – and this is specifically addressed to you – can create specific circumstances here that would signify a tangible improvement in living conditions for the local people. That also involves us taking on specific responsibility for the Arab Spring this autumn. This Agreement can surely only be a first step towards comprehensive trade cooperation as partners. In light, in particular, of the important global political decision, however, I would also like, here in plenary, to explicitly express my amazement at the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Up until just before the vote in committee, it threatened to reject the Agreement. As the price for its consent in the Committee on International Trade, it forced the deletion from Parliament’s explanatory statement of the reference to the settlements and blockades by Israel being partly to blame for the poverty and unemployment in Palestine. Shutting our eyes to reality is not a valid position to take, and the facts and challenges still remain. The same applies to the question of the deletion of the passage relating to the circumvention of the rules of origin by Israeli manufacturers. We will not solve the problem by not allowing a spade to be called a spade. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner De Gucht, the resolution that will be passed by the European Parliament gives you a clear mandate in this critical phase of the Doha negotiations: you must press for a positive interim result at multilateral level in Geneva that will contribute to a reduction in the poverty suffered in the world. Everyone gathered here today recognises the status quo, which is why we must have an eye to the future – as Mr Taylor has just said: do you remember the start of these talks? The Doha Round was instigated 10 years ago in the shadow of the attacks in New York and the intention was to contribute to an improvement in living conditions in developing countries by further developing the WTO, thus eliminating the basis for the propaganda of hatred. However, the Commission’s negotiators and those of its competitors are mainly concentrating on the opening up of the global markets for services and penetration into previously protected sectors of general public interest. Developing countries were able to come together within the WTO to prevent this opening up from being forced upon them. In turn, you responded by switching the emphasis to the conclusion of bilateral agreements that enabled you to pursue your chief interests more effectively. This approach has patently failed to help reduce poverty. It actually threatens the establishment of a system of fair trade rules with worldwide validity under the umbrella of the WTO. For this reason, my group urgently calls on you to return to the primacy of multilateral agreement. The least you should do in Geneva is to obtain an agreement for the so-called least developed countries package, which would bring improvements for the world’s poorest. We would also call on you to withdraw the Commission’s threat to abandon the promise to abolish the EU’s export subsidies for agricultural produce should the Doha Round fail. In view of the present catastrophic famine in East Africa and the increasingly difficult situation of the farmers – not just in the developing countries, but there in particular – it is actually necessary to speed up the abolition of export subsidies.

 Madam President, in light of the scope to act that we are afforded as Parliament, we really have to ask, ladies and gentlemen, whether we, too, have sufficient legitimacy for our actions here. Mr Duff’s report – and I very much welcome the many years of work that he has carried out – puts forward specific proposals for strengthening the European element. Some of these will clearly not receive majority support, but he is taking the right approach and it deserves broad support and a public debate, including outside this Chamber. In our group, too, there were heated debates about the specific proposals in the report. This reflects the divergent interests in, and experience with, the European Union. On one point there is agreement. Parliament is not the only place for discussing and taking decisions concerning democracy. Therefore, I give my clear support to the approach taken in the report, which I believe is the right one, and to the report’s call, right from the outset, to go well beyond the negotiating mandate towards the Council. Citizens must be given their own voice in this process and the European political parties must be active in this regard. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, it is not the first time that we have discussed the Arab countries and the upheavals there. While we are debating the developments that have taken place from Syria to Morocco, in my opinion, Parliament is also reappraising its own past, in other words, the cooperation that was at least tolerated between the European Union and countries which we rightly refer to today as having autocratic regimes and whose internal structures we are concerned about. This is a good thing. However, I cannot help but get the impression that we have once again started to relax in the supposed certainty that everything is under control and everything will be all right. The thing which I personally find impossible to deal with is that we are continuing to comment on political processes, but we are still not prepared to put these developments in their national and regional social context and to investigate the causes of these changes. We must finally stop applying double standards in our foreign policy and also in our democratic dealings with one another. We should talk about the interrelationships between EU Neighbourhood Policy and EU policy on the failure to resolve the Palestinian conflict. I very much welcome your commitment to the Quartet. We should discuss the fact that the war against Colonel Gaddafi’s autocratic regime, which some EU Member States and NATO are involved in, is already having dramatic economic consequences in Tunisia. The outflow of capital, Tunisians returning home to look for work, migrants, a collapse in the country’s income from tourism and in its trade relationships are just some of the issues. This war is also playing into the hands of the powers in the military and the political elite in Egypt who want to return to the previous regime. We are now dealing not just with new problems and no longer only with old problems. Baroness Ashton, Mr Füle, we need a fundamental political and economic reorientation of the European Union’s foreign policy activities. I believe that this has become clear during the course of this debate. Helmut Scholz  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations with Canada are being conducted with a country that has a strong economy and a highly developed legal system. It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate, if not conceal, an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court. Why ever should an ordinary court not decide on compensation in cases of doubt? Which courts do you, as the Commission, not have any trust in whatsoever? Is it the Canadian courts or those in the European Union? Do you not see that, with this part of the agreement, you would be discriminating against the local undertakings? As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission’s approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a ‘negative list’. This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open. We want to retain public services. I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada’s social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter. The European Parliament is also calling for the protection of workers, payment of overtime, minimum wages and rejection of social dumping. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now almost a year since the people of Pakistan suffered devastating floods. We all have very close ties with the people of this stricken country. What is scandalous, however, is the fact that the negotiations in the WTO are still dragging on, and that alone makes it clear that this form of trade facilitation is not suitable to be used as an emergency aid measure. My group has repeatedly called on the Commission to put forward a plan B in order to be able to help the people of Pakistan quickly and permanently to rebuild their country. No alternative solution has been presented, however. Perhaps the Commission simply lacks ideas or is unable to act because it feels obstructed by resistance in the European Council, which it is only too familiar with. Otherwise, it would seem as if the difficult negotiations in the WTO are being used as an excuse for the lack of action. You knew as well as we did that these negotiations would be difficult before they even started and you probably also already knew this when some of the foreign ministers from Germany and other Member States sent you on this mission. After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection. It is precisely this status advantage that enables Bangladesh to import primary products from Pakistan, to process them and then export them to Europe. It is no wonder that this country is now putting up resistance. However, we cannot in all honesty expect approval for our desire to help Pakistan at the expense of one of the poorest countries in the world. By doing so, we will ultimately damage ourselves, too, and indeed we will be doing this on the eve of the presentation of the new Commission draft on the revision of our system of trade preferences. My solution to this problem is therefore as follows: place the focus on direct aid for the reconstruction following the floods and take immediate action instead of losing in the negotiations in Geneva. After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Commissioner, the motions for resolutions that the European Parliament has been presented with make it clear to all groups that Parliament – as has already been emphasised – does not feel it is sufficiently informed about the specific status of the negotiations. I am therefore grateful for the more detailed information that we have been given today. The questions from the left side of this House in particular deal directly with the concerns of the people in Europe, but also in India, and these are concerns for their own social and economic situation and the prospects of workers and those looking for work, including in the EU Member States. As we know, the devil is in the detail, so we would like to know the following, Commissioner: what are the specific subjects of the negotiations when it comes to public invitations to tender in the services sector or in connection with labour migration? What text is on the table with regard to intellectual property rights? What is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture? By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world’s poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies. We want to examine whether European local authorities, hospitals or ministries are, in future, to be obliged to make calls for tenders in which Indian companies can also be included. We want to know whether the agreement will regulate the conditions of entry into the Member States of the European Union of Indian nurses or carers for the elderly, including the length of stay and recognition of qualifications. We want to know whether the agreement text will put small-scale farmers and fishermen in India at risk and whether European steel workers are threatened with redundancy because Indian capital will, in future, be able to be invested freely in the purchase of companies in the EU as a result of the agreement.

 Madam President, Commissioner, just one topic should be the focus of attention when the summit is held between the European Union and Japan at the end of this month: the disaster that has devastated the people of Japan as a result of earthquakes, the tsunami and continuing radioactive contamination, and the concrete role that can be played by the EU, its Member States and individual citizens in helping to deal with the resulting problems in the short, medium and long term. That is why I once again wish to express my deepest sympathies to the Japanese people. We must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster – particularly in view of the debate we have just held on Pakistan. The summit must produce concrete decisions, particularly in relation to cooperation in clearing contaminated areas and joint research and development in the area of renewable energy. The possible development of our trade relations and economic cooperation through a corresponding agreement should not be simply a response to the nuclear accident. For this reason, negotiations should not begin too hastily, but should be examined with due care, paying particular attention to the different traditions and lifestyle. In view of the size and strength of the two economies, particular care is required when agreeing a comprehensive, bilateral trade agreement. Many issues have been raised, including intellectual property rights and public procurement, and the investment capital has reduced the scope for political action on both sides. That is why long-term impact assessments are required in relation to the relevant chapters and aspects of any economic and trade policy cooperation agreed in the future between the 27 EU Member States and Japan. For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work and for trying, in the spirit of the European Parliament, to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides, and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis. This is not a simple issue. It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States with regard to social, economic and employment policy, weighing up the interests of financial groups, big business and economic enterprises, on the one hand, and those of the trade unions and workers on the other. That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen’s should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament. For this reason, I hope that tomorrow’s vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament. Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Mr Füle, Mr Siwiec, thank you for devoting yourself to this subject. Parliament’s almost unanimous opinion is that Neighbourhood Policy has not produced the expected results. I agree with that. However, I do not agree with the analysis of the causes. The results do not meet our expectations because we have not focused on the interests which we have in common with our neighbours. Instead, we have concentrated on our own interests and on our ideas of how neighbouring countries should develop. Quite obviously, what we need is a different approach. We need a policy which makes cooperation between both sides a central principle and which respects the sovereign right of the citizens in the partner countries to shape their future without outside interference. The content of the policy must focus on our common European challenges and transform partnership policy into a permanent tool for genuine cooperative discussions and for identifying solutions to joint problems. We will not make any progress in our Neighbourhood Policy unless we change our views and develop new political approaches. Helmut Scholz,

 Mr President, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament is taking a serious-minded and practical approach to the issue of the democratisation of European decision-making processes. As Mrs Giannakou’s report shows, this approach also involves the further development of European parties, which, although they have been an everyday political reality in Europe for many years, until now have not been equal partners and players in terms of their democratic influence on EU policy. We need political parties at EU level too that are firmly rooted in the societies they represent and that can play a strong role in the elections to the European Parliament and in establishing European openness, based on internal democratic structures and regulations. With regard to this particular report, I must say that I would have liked the rapporteur to have shown a great deal more courage by using the Parliament’s right of initiative to take a truly significant step in developing the political system and the party system in the European Union. This is a step that many citizens have been waiting for and that will encourage them to get involved. The interlocking European and national decision-making levels and the relations between the political parties could have been addressed more clearly as a common factor that is transparent and open to influence. The European Parliament should now decisively call on the Commission and Council to take the initiative in this regard. I would expect constructive cooperation from the Commission and Council.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Leichtfried, for his work on this report and, on behalf of my group, I wish him every success in the undoubtedly difficult negotiations with the Council, which is unfortunately not present at this debate. However, I would like to mention two aspects. The amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) are not helpful to the rapporteur, but undermine the negotiating position of Parliament defined in the Committee on International Trade. The amendments seek to make life easier for arms exporters. Therefore, my group will not support these amendments. Secondly, I would like to state that my group has considerable problems with the use of the dual-use list to block the access of developing countries in particular to high technology. This relates, in particular, to restrictions on the export of high-performance computers. We have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual-use list, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, we have drawn up Amendment 47, and I would ask for your support for this amendment in the interests of the developing countries. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an important aspect of international trade policy very late in the day. Given its importance, I would have preferred the House to be full, with all the seats occupied. The European Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a major achievement of European trade policy. It opens up our market to the poorest countries in the world for all types of goods except arms. It also gives developing countries trade concessions on a whole range of products. GSP+ is a valuable incentive system which offers developing countries further concessions if they sign and put into practice important international agreements on human rights, labour standards and protecting the environment. However, the system does have weak points and it needs to be updated regularly. Over the years, the European Parliament, partner countries, companies and non-governmental organisations have made important suggestions for improving the system. The whole world is now waiting for the Commission to issue its proposal on the much-needed revision of the system. The deadline for this proposal was 1 June 2010. The Commission has not delivered on time and its failure to do so has left the countries involved and companies both inside and outside the EU in a dangerous state of uncertainty. The existing regulation must now be revised. You are attempting to rescue the situation by means of a transitional regulation and this is what we will be voting on tomorrow, that is on Thursday. The transitional regulation is simply an extension. It does not change anything, it does not improve anything and it does not implement the new requirements resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and, as the rapporteur, I have felt the same. It is the obligation of the Members of this Parliament to ensure that the rights, the duties and also the powers granted to the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe by the Treaty of Lisbon are respected. It is also our obligation to make sure that the reduction in tariffs brings about a genuine improvement in the situation of the developing countries. In order to protect the EU’s partners from the consequences of a long-drawn-out procedure, I suggested initially to the Committee on International Trade that only those elements of the regulation should be amended which are necessary to allow Parliament to fulfil its new role. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that I also believe a general redrafting of the GSP and GSP+ schemes is needed. During the intensive meetings with the Council and the Commission on the legal issues resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon which affect the transitional regulation, Parliament finally decided to take a big leap of faith. At this point, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to the chair of the Committee on International Trade, Professor Moreira, for his untiring efforts as mediator and also to you, Mr De Gucht, for the Commission’s assurance that key amendments, in particular with regard to informing and involving Parliament, would be addressed in practice. Therefore, we decided to drop all our amendments, in order to enable the transitional regulation to come into force as quickly as possible. We did this primarily in the interests of our partners and of the companies which are affected. The Commission’s assurance includes a promise in future to inform the European Parliament in full, immediately and at the same time as the Council about work relating to essential aspects of the GSP and about all developments and to share all documents relating to the GSP. The Commission also guarantees that the European Parliament will be notified about any suspension of preferences, in accordance with Article 16(3), about withdrawals, including the corresponding investigation reports from the Commission, in accordance with Article 17, and about safeguard decisions, in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, before they come into force. We welcome the tabling of Omnibus 1 and the Commission’s readiness to enter into an in-depth discussion of the proposals which it has made in Omnibus 1. At the same time, we would like to remind the Commission that Omnibus 2 must be tabled urgently. Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation. We must not forget that we need to fight for the ongoing and fundamental implementation of Parliament’s parliamentary rights. Helmut Scholz,  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr De Gucht, I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very much for working together so constructively. Now that we have finally agreed on the formal aspects of the transitional regulation, I would like to make use of this debate to explain briefly some of the requirements for the future regulation. The new version of the regulation should have the following basic objectives: 1. To increase the efficiency of the system; 2. To develop rules that will provide for a better regulated reform process in which the involvement of the beneficiaries is guaranteed; 3. To ensure that the regulation gives due weight to the task of democratic control which Parliament is required to perform. This includes proposals from the Committee on Development. The new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) should be a clearer and more transparent system. I would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin. The rules of origin and the administrative procedures that accompany them are one of the main reasons why the trade preferences granted by the GSP are being underused, particularly by the least developed countries. In the current version of the system, the rules of origin often prevent preferences that exist on paper from having a positive impact. I have just come back from the Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva and this problem was very high up on the list of issues discussed there. In my opinion, the EU should campaign within the WTO for the preference system to be given priority as part of its work on harmonising the rules of origin. My second point concerns the partner countries. Here I feel that it is particularly important for us to develop more straightforward criteria. The Gini coefficient is a good example of this type of criterion. As already mentioned, we need to be more flexible in order to be able to respond more effectively. My third point is about technical assistance. Preferences alone are not enough. We need to increase the impact of the system and improve the rate of utilisation of the GSP by providing technical assistance. This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole. I would like to thank everyone involved once again for their constructive approach. I will be happy to continue working with the Commission on the basis of today’s assurances. Helmut Scholz,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, only last autumn, the European Parliament specifically welcomed the fact that the Heads of State or Government of the European Union had explicitly recognised, in a statement from the Madrid Summit, the sovereign right of states to manage their own natural resources and to control their use. The statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criteria. The summit was attended by Latin American countries, but the same laws apply to China and other states. The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) has led to serious environmental damage in China, as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere. This must not continue. We need an international agreement. China and other potential producers need our expertise and technology transfer in order to ensure that their mining processes are environmentally friendly and that their miners can work in much greater safety. China is also interested in investing in high-tech production facilities for processing REEs, because it does not just want to be a supplier of raw materials. The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here. A modern raw materials policy must be characterised by partnership. At the same time, you must put the emphasis on developing improved recycling and substitution technologies, because in future, the metals found in REEs will become even rarer: too rare simply to use them once.

 Mr President, Commissioner, with the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement signed in October 2010, which has been assigned the attribute by the Commission and the Council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the EU and a highly industrialised state, the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98% in the next five years. The trade exchange between the EU and Korea is supposed to double in the medium term and that – so it is said – will speed up economic growth and the creation of jobs and prosperity. My group and I have justified doubts about this prediction. Quite apart from the mantra of the role of free trade as a kind of saviour of the global economy that is currently in a precarious state, which is also reflected in the Free Trade Agreement itself, it is not clear from this agreement whether it will, or will able to, help us deal with the global challenges arising as a result of climate change and the necessary fundamental economic restructuring. What are the efficiency criteria and what are the free trade criteria? At the same time, Commissioner, the Free Trade Agreement that has been concluded hardly contains any references to sustainability for the future, oriented change or international economic cooperation. An agreement is being concluded in which the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation are still being contravened. (The President cut off the speaker.) Helmut Scholz,

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories (ICI) is being fundamentally amended in this parliamentary term. We plan to jointly allocate up to EUR 348 million to cooperation in areas such as science, academic exchanges – including Erasmus Mundus –, culture, environmental protection and renewable energy, as well as the stimulation of bilateral trade relations. Particular consideration should be given here to small and medium-sized enterprises. The new aspect is that with what is known as ICI Plus, projects in developing countries can now also be financed – and specifically projects that do not fall under the general definition of development aid measures. These include projects and measures such as sending European students to universities in Africa, Asia or Latin America – a completely new element. In the current times, when the EU has a greater responsibility to realign its cooperation in partnership with a growing number of states, allowing self-determined development has a particular part to play in this. The recast of the regulation needs to clearly mark the opportunities and challenges arising from the expansion of its geographical scope. It clearly states who can obtain financial assistance, for what purposes and on what terms. Another new element of this instrument is that the regulation specifies that the allocation of funding must ensure that the partner countries comply with the core working standards of the International Labour Organisation and that they work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an important contribution to the international fight against climate change. Equally important, the rule of law and human dignity in work are elevated to cooperation objectives. As we are going into the second reading, allow me to restate that I consider it essential to ensure that when granting financial assistance no concessions are made as regards the basic principles of the European Union. When promoting projects in developing countries attention needs to be paid in future to policy coherence, and particularly to harmonisation with measures to combat the food crisis. In the plenary vote at first reading it was decided – albeit by a narrow majority – that none of the funds allocated to development aid thus far should be devoted to ICI Plus. We are going into the second reading with an accelerated rapprochement on this, as on all the financing instruments. Following successful compromise negotiations between Council and the European Parliament we have adapted ICI Plus to the challenges of the future. All the matters of substance have been approved by a majority in plenary. So far, so good – or so it would seem. However, it remains undecided how we will deal in future with the division of powers between the two legislative bodies of the EU resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly in the area of communitarised international trade policy. The issue at stake here is democracy, and specifically what are known as delegated acts – which is something on which the European Parliament and the Commission and Council continue to have differing views. What is this all about? We want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate. We want to check whether the multiannual strategic planning by the European External Action Service and the Commission for implementing our regulations is in accordance with the spirit of the legislator. In the past the Commission has unfortunately too often taken the attitude that you can write anything you like on paper. The Treaty of Lisbon gives us a new role and duty as a legislator, and we demand a right of veto. The rapporteurs for the various foreign policy financing instruments, the chairs of the committees and the leaders of the groups are all agreed that we must fight for this democratic right. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conduct we have seen so far shows that not all three bodies of the European Union have yet recognised this principle. We are therefore vigorously defending our right of control today because in future the Commission must base its planning on what the legislator has laid down, not on its own communications.

 Madam President, Mr De Gucht, you are absolutely right that the outside world does not understand why we cannot come to an agreement with the Council. The Council is not even present for this debate, which I very much regret, because that is not a good omen for the completion of the second reading. However, we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right, which are enshrined in the treaty, are not being recognised. I believe, and Mr Brok has discussed this in detail, that this is only about giving us the opportunity to intervene. Perhaps I can give one more example with regard to the content. In the Commission’s multiannual plan for my industrialised countries instrument (ICI), the reference document was not the amended regulation, but instead the Global Europe strategy. This uses language which has become obsolete since the advent of the economic crisis and the resulting trade problems when it says that the objective of the multiannual plan is to promote European business and profit interests. According to the text, the instrument is intended to resolve the problems which EU companies have in penetrating certain markets. I can only repeat that this is not what the legislators intended the instrument to achieve and they have not put aside any taxpayers’ money for this purpose. In our view, the ICI should be a modern cooperation programme and not a weapon of conquest. To give another example, this time in more blunt terms: For us, the countries of south-east Asia are not just junior partners, as the Commission has stated. As part of the cooperation with central Asia, the instrument must not focus solely on EU access to the gas reserves there. When we look at the Maghreb region and the developments in the Middle East, it is clear that we need to take a long-term, large-scale approach to cooperation. I hope that the new regulation will be future-proof. I also hope that this financing instrument will encourage exchanges on an equal footing between the EU and third countries and will help to create openness throughout the world and promote responsible support for sustainable development processes which are in the interests of citizens.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my group has not signed up to the compromise resolution on Belarus. However, I would like to make it clear that this should not be seen as an acceptance on our part of the results of the election, the arrests and the reprisals against those with differing opinions. For us, fair, transparent and democratic elections – ‘the freedom of dissenters’ to quote Rosa Luxemburg – are a basic requirement for establishing a relationship with Belarus and with all other states. This also includes the immediate release of all political detainees. However, I doubt whether sanctions are really an effective means of bringing about the immediate release of political prisoners and radical changes in the democratic system in Belarus. Sanctions have had little effect in the past in Belarus and elsewhere. Ladies and gentlemen, you are as well aware of this as I am. A better approach seems to me to be to confront those who hold political power with our arguments and demands in the context of a political dialogue, not to give them the opportunity to discredit the criticisms made by those in civil society by referring to external criticism, to establish a transparent political system and to coordinate our efforts with those of all our foreign policy partners in Belarus. This also seems to be more honest in relation to our own arguments, as this morning’s discussion on the Hungarian Presidency has shown. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I have two brief comments on the report: firstly, I believe it is right and good that with this report the European Parliament is getting involved in the debate on economic and monetary union. After all, this is an issue of such importance that it cannot be left to the Council alone. To date, in the management of the crisis the Council has proven to be more a stronghold of nationalism than a place where European solutions are developed. Secondly, economic and monetary union is not sufficient. During the crisis many citizens viewed the work of the European Union, Parliament, the Commission and the Council as a means of supporting the banks. Whether that is true in all cases is a moot point, but that is the experience of many citizens: the banks are being supported, while the social situation of many citizens is becoming increasingly precarious. It is not sufficient simply to talk about prosperity, as the spokesperson for the Council did. What is required is a social union that guarantees all citizens social rights. If we do not manage to achieve this, the EU will lose the support of citizens. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank my colleagues for the good work they have done together, but especially Mr Ferber. This has really been a very good, fair and open collaboration. It is not always this way, so it is much appreciated in this case. At this point I would also like to thank the non-governmental organisations. They made a significant contribution, especially in the area of food speculation. What may not be obvious, and I want to emphasise this, is that the rapporteur has also engaged in the process. It has not always been easy and comfortable. I do believe, however, that at that point it was very important and good that the non-governmental organisations were involved in working on this area. This process opened up the dry, heavy issue of financial market regulation a little to some of the people, the citizens. It does Parliament good to let such an important issue get out of this House a little. I echo what Mr Giegold said earlier. We have taken an important and good step in the area of food speculation. However, there are still a few questions with regard to omissions – there may still be a few loopholes there. Nevertheless, this will be revealed by experience and then we will have to re-work this area. I think that what we have done on high-frequency trading is very deserving of support: I – and, I believe, the majority of my Group – can wholeheartedly support it. This is also not a matter of course, but on that point we have succeeded in creating something good and practical. On commissions, I can only echo what has already been said. It also seems to me to be a point in need of a little adjustment. However, this process is not so straightforward: tomorrow there will be further amendments proposed. Let us see what the result of that is. Jürgen Klute,

Madam President, first of all, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs. I think that overall, the report establishes a good position for this House in this heated debate between Parliament and the Council. From my Group’s perspective, I would point out, first and foremost, that austerity policies in recent years have obviously failed and that countries which have run such policies and are under pressure to make savings have seen a loss of growth and tax revenue but also an increase in poverty and unemployment. Cuts in the MFF would mean the continuation and entrenchment of these policies for the next seven years, as a substantial proportion of the EU budget goes back to the Member States where it is used to support economic development, research and education. For that reason, we cannot and will not vote for such cuts in the MFF. Let me take an example from history. My country, the Federal Republic of Germany, faced a similar deep-seated crisis after the Second World War. Then in 1953, the London debt agreement was adopted, which not only cancelled Germany’s debts; it also, and above all, aimed to provide clear and tangible impetus for economic growth through programmes initiated under the Marshall Plan. This helped to bring Germany out of its post-war indebtedness and paved the way for its economy to develop in the way that it has. So our view is that we cannot make cuts: we must expand the budget and develop it further, and thus ensure that growth can help us overcome this crisis. I fully support Helga Trüpel’s detailed comments about own resources and the Financial Transaction Tax. We support this position too and would welcome rather more commitment from Parliament to moving forward on the question of own resources and implementation of the Financial Transaction Tax, as this is an important issue for this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Commissioner, I basically welcome your initiative for common banking supervision in Europe. I believe that is necessary. I have a couple of questions, however. The European landscape, the EU, is dotted with a wide variety of banks: savings banks, cooperative banks, private banks, big banks. I believe that we must maintain and protect this variety, even with European supervision. I believe this is very important because many of the small banks were stable throughout the crisis and should not be sent to the wall. Secondly, I would like to say that I do not believe that supervision alone will be enough. The supervisory body must also have effective instruments to enable it to intervene in the market as necessary, even removing toxic products from the market as required. Thirdly, and lastly, however good a bank supervisory body may be, it can still do little, with the legal situation as it currently is, with regard to the shadow bank sector. This means that we still need to remain aware of the fact that only part of the problem will be resolved with such bank supervision. The problem of the shadow banks will remain. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, Mr Barnier, on our agenda this week is a legislative own-initiative report on the subject of access to basic banking services. Parliament makes clear and detailed proposals from its perspective about what the Commission’s legislative initiative could and should look like. The first specific proposal concerns the schedule. A very large majority of the members of the main committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, believes that we should not waste any more time unnecessarily on this subject. Therefore, we are calling on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to Parliament by January 2013. I think that we are working along the same lines as Mr Barnier. We are of the opinion that the EU must make it possible for the 30 million citizens who have not yet had a bank account of their own to become part of the normal financial system. Without a bank account, things which the rest of us take for granted soon become insoluble problems. Renting a flat, signing a contract with an electricity supplier or joining the modern world of work are almost impossible in most countries unless you have a bank account. We believe that all of this should not be allowed to fail simply because the banks are aiming to maximise their profits. To quote the report: banks also have a responsibility for society. We will only have a functioning social market economy and a modern internal market when the banks genuinely take on this responsibility. However, let us be honest about the situation. Many citizens no longer trust the EU to achieve these goals. When it comes to the crunch, as it has in the current crisis, for the majority of citizens, these are just empty words. They know that the EU is supporting the banks with large rescue packages and many of them feel as if they have been left out in the cold. At least that is the impression that more and more citizens of more and more countries in the European Union have. The report which we will be voting on tomorrow was not originally planned as an own-initiative report. If the majority of the Commissioners had stuck to the Commission’s plan, today we would be able to present the citizens with the results of the negotiations. Work could already have begun on establishing the right of consumers throughout Europe to an account or these accounts could even be a reality already. We regard the recommendation that the Commission has sent to the Member States as disappointing. Many of the responses from the Member States to the request and to the Commission’s country reports are more akin to satire than to a sensible policy which is relevant to the citizens. In order to understand this, we need to remind ourselves of one thing. The question of access to bank accounts involves business interests, which is quite normal. These are interests which could hardly be more different as far as their opportunities for influence are concerned. Therefore, politicians must be responsible for ensuring a fair and socially desirable balance of interests. That is our job as politicians and as Members of Parliament. I cannot cover all the aspects of the report here. I simply want to highlight briefly what I believe are a few key points. One of these is cost. A basic account should be provided free of charge or at least at a reasonable charge. This is what the report says. In order to ensure that this is the case, the Member States should set a mandatory upper limit. The Commission should also investigate the possibility of an EU-wide upper limit for charges on a basic account, because we will not reach our target group without clear regulations on costs. Access is another important point. We must keep the bureaucratic obstacles to a minimum for consumers who rely on a basic account. Financial exclusion goes hand in hand with social exclusion. Another key point is subsidiarity. A directive would enable us to take the individual features of each country into account. We believe that the Member States would be best placed to define potential exceptions if as many of the banks as possible were covered by the directive. Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to the members of the negotiating team, to the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also to Mr Barnier for our very effective and constructive collaboration. This definitely made a major contribution to the success of the report. Jürgen Klute,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, I would like once again to thank everyone very much for supporting this report. This has been made very clear. Mr Barnier, you have heard that this initiative has broad support here in Parliament. I believe it is now time for the Commission to take action. We all know that you are very committed. No one doubts your commitment. However, we also know that there is opposition to this within the Commission. Please tell the College of Commissioners what you have heard here. You can be sure that you will have our broad support on this matter. It is true that there are one or two detailed issues that still need discussing, but I feel that we were able to work together very constructively across all the groups in the compromise negotiations. I am sure that we will find solutions for the specific issues which everyone will be happy with. Finally, I would like to say that I am looking forward to continuing to work together with everyone on this subject. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2010, the Heads of State or Government of the EU Member States finally acknowledged that the European Community needs a more closely coordinated financial and economic policy. At the summit, they ‘invented’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed. An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy. It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘mini jobs’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight. I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea behind the ‘two-pack’ is to provide further rights of intervention in respect of crisis countries in the euro area. The idea is to give teeth to the European Semester, which was created as a framework to provide better coordination of financial and economic policy. At the Commission’s behest, the Member States are to be forced to accept financial assistance. Through the ‘six-pack’, extensive sanction options that could be imposed on euro area countries with financial problems have already been created. The European Semester has already been perceived by the citizens more as a rollback of democracy than as a useful tool to coordinate economic policy. At the same time, the German Government is openly threatening Greek citizens with being kicked out of the euro area should they make the wrong choice in the elections on Sunday. Why do we not desist from such humiliating and undemocratic chest-beating? In a situation where the euro crisis has dramatically worsened once again – I am thinking of Spain, and of Cyprus – it in no way helps us to pillory Member States that are in crisis. We should at last produce some solutions! The rapporteurs for the ‘two-pack’ have developed some very sensible approaches in this regard. Ms Ferreira made reference to the debt redemption fund, which would be a worthwhile and sensible measure in order to tackle the debts. Mr Gauzès’s proposal for an organised process for national bankruptcy would perhaps also be an option. It is key, however, that Europe should work together and show solidarity in order to set the eurozone back on track for growth. The strong countries in Europe must desist from their self-satisfied finger pointing at their partner countries. They need to begin doing their homework, investing in growth and taking on their responsibilities. A Merkel-style policy of cuts on one side only has simply failed as a model to resolve the crisis. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial transaction tax is certainly not identical to the Tobin tax that has been talked about and debated for many years, but I think it incorporates essential elements of the Tobin tax. It can at least be said to take on board the idea that the financial markets should participate in the tax system and, above all, should share in bearing the costs of the crisis. I think that sends a very important message to the financial markets. However, it is also an important message to send to our citizens, to our electorate. There have been a great many actions, petitions and written pleas to politicians in a wide range of Member States asking for a financial transaction tax to at last be introduced at European level. I believe that with the majority that we are seeing here in favour of this report and this tax, Parliament has achieved a major success. While it is undoubtedly not sufficient to stabilise and restrict the markets in the way that may be necessary, I feel it is a really important step that we are taking here. I would particularly like to urge the Council to take seriously the voices of our citizens, of our electorate, and to work towards this actually being introduced and not to block the introduction of this tax because of the British position or other positions. I think it is clear that the citizens of the European Union want this tax, and I think we have a great responsibility here. It is now up to the Council to take action on this, and I should like to use my speaking time to urge the Council to do everything it can to ensure that this tax is now actually introduced and becomes a reality.

Well, in so doing, we are merely picking up on the tax that the City of London takes on derivatives, and even if we do not consider the tax rate to be sufficient, then that by no means suggests that we do not think this project is a good one. I see no contradiction there, and it would add something into the bargain if it corresponded to what has long been the practice in the City of London. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
),  
in writing. 
– This FTT plan picks up on a number of elements of the Tobin tax which has been under discussion for many years now. It is an important signal to send to citizens, markets and banks following a series of campaigns and petitions aimed at introducing an FTT at EU level. Obviously, it could have gone further. It is not sufficient to stabilise financial markets and more needs to be done, but I urge the Council to follow the citizens and do everything possible to prevent this proposal from being blocked by Member States.

 Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that in my opinion the sections in Ms Oomen-Ruijten’s report concerning the judiciary and constitutional reform are highly successful. I would like to congratulate her on these sections. However, I also believe that far too little attention has been paid to the subject of the situation of the Kurds in Turkey. As has been said several times, there are not only hundreds of journalists in prison, but also thousands of Kurds and in particular Kurdish politicians who are members of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP). Some of them are elected members of parliament. This is not the way to resolve the conflict between the Turkish Government and the Kurds. It would be good to make our position on this subject clearer in the report. Together with some other Members, we have tabled amendments for tomorrow. I will be very pleased if there is majority support for these amendments. In my opinion, it will not help if we close our eyes to what is happening at this point. The EU must make itself clearly heard with regard to this issue. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what will the citizens of Europe think of the way in which we are handling the crisis after the last summit? They will realise that the banks are receiving around EUR 1 trillion from the European Central Bank (ECB) without any conditions being imposed on them. No strings are attached to this money and the banks can use it for whatever purpose they want. In contrast, the countries that are in crisis are being gagged and forced to introduce disastrous austerity measures. The citizens of the crisis countries are having to put up with cuts in their pay, pensions and social security benefits. However, unlike Germany, the economies of these crisis countries are not dependent on exports, but on their own internal markets. It is precisely these markets which are being destroyed by the austerity policies that have been imposed. This is not the right way to get out of the crisis, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy. In political terms, the EU is being driven into a brick wall. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to start with the positive aspects. I would like to emphasise that we welcome what Mr La Via’s report says on the subject of growth, which is that the focus must be on growth. We need growth that creates jobs and that can help combat youth unemployment. We think that this is very important. I would like to highlight the fact that we welcome the points relating to research and investment in research. However, I think we need clearer statements on fighting poverty within Europe and also in the world as a whole, on a global level. Moreover, the report did not look at how we are to combat climate change. I am very critical of the opening section of the report, which concerns automatic sanctions. I think that threatening the Member States with automatic sanctions is a mistake, given that they are already in a difficult situation with regard to their budgets. We are opposed to this. However, I want to highlight one point which I think is very sensible and that is increased coordination of the budgets of the Member States and the EU using a process which has democratic legitimacy. I would like to make one final remark on the subject of cutbacks. I want to emphasise that we do not believe that budget cuts are appropriate. We have already made it clear that Croatia will be joining the EU during the course of the year. We will have a whole series of new jobs to do in the EU and we have had new supervisory bodies in place now for more than a year. We need these bodies and we need funding and staff for them, so that they can work effectively and prevent future crises. This will ensure that the expenditure is a sensible investment which will help us to save money in future. In my opinion, these are the crucial points. Most importantly, we hope that we can work to ensure that there are no budget cuts. For us, that is essential. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday. The detailed regulations are also now available. What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified? Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem. A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however. I would say to the Commission that ‘cheap’ is not the same thing as ‘good’. It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners. Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story. I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed. That is nonsense. In the face of increasing world trade, Europe’s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink. Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade. We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, for years, the size of the EU budget has been hovering at more or less the same level. In that time, the responsibilities of the EU have continually expanded and the need for finance has increased significantly. Thus, financial market supervision made it necessary to establish new institutions. However, in order for them to be able to carry out their tasks effectively, these institutions need adequate financial resources. As a result of the financial and banking crisis, the economic weaknesses of some Member States of the EU have become clear. A comprehensive economic recovery plan would be needed to strengthen the economies of these countries. Some economic experts even talk of the need for a Marshall Plan for the crisis-stricken Member States. The EU does not need austerity programmes that impair growth; instead it needs a growth-promoting spending programme that will safeguard jobs and incomes for workers and young people in the EU. Yet what does the Council do in this situation? It curtails the Commission’s proposal, which already falls far short of what is needed. If an appropriate increase in the budget is not feasible in the current political climate, Parliament and the Commission should at least do everything they can to ward off the cuts proposed by the Council. Jürgen Klute,

 Madam President, Mr Šemeta, I would like to make a few comments on the tax agreement between Germany and Switzerland, as other speakers have done. Instead of stopping tax evasion and blocking the loopholes for tax evaders, which would have been sensible, the result that has been produced here is a Swiss cheese full of large holes. The proposed transition period of five months gives tax evaders plenty of time to transfer their money from Switzerland to other tax havens. As foundations and trusts are not governed by the agreement, it is also possible to transform assets which have been stashed away in Switzerland into the assets of a foundation. Forms for doing this can be obtained from Swiss banks. Tax investigators in Germany have recently received information about a number of tax evaders who have hidden their assets away in Switzerland. The agreement gives these people an amnesty and the tax investigators can no longer use the information that has been made available to them. What sort of agreement is it that restricts the activities of tax investigators? An advertising video produced by Swiss banks says about this agreement that customers will benefit even more in future from the values of Switzerland as a financial centre. The agreement obviously not only lacks the necessary coordination at EU level, but also counteracts the efforts of the EU to bring more transparency into tax issues, to make the collection of tax in the Member States more efficient and, above all, to combat and to prevent tax fraud. Therefore, this agreement is, in our view, not acceptable. We are calling on the EU to oppose it, if there is any doubt. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you very much, Commissioner, for your answer which sounds very positive. However, I would like to emphasise once again that the problem lies in the fact that there was already a human rights clause in the old preferences scheme and it did not help to prevent the violations of human rights which took place under the Uribe government and before that. Therefore, my question was specifically: What exactly will be different? How do the EU and the Commission intend to guarantee in future that these violations of human rights will not be repeated? On the other hand, I have figures which show that under the new government in the last 300 days there have been more than 200 attacks on human rights activists. Also 15 leaders who supported human rights and the fair distribution of land in the agricultural sector have been murdered. When I look at what is happening, I have to ask once again: How exactly are you going to ensure that you can prevent this? I still do not know what the answer to this question is. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Goebbels has just set out very clearly the role that derivatives played in the financial crisis and what scale they possess. In view of this enormous scale, many citizens are calling for such financial products to be taken off the market altogether. We called for that too. However, we realise that such a small political group as ours has no chance of achieving a majority for this. We have to accept that, and we do. Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise once again that we thought it would be sensible to go further in this regard. On the other hand – and I say this to Mr Langen clearly and with respect – in our view the resulting report is acceptable and fair. Three important points from our perspective are the clearing obligation, the authorisation and monitoring of central counterparties and the reporting requirement for derivatives traders. These seem to us to provide an important and capable basic framework and a sound infrastructure that will enable us to arrive at a rational regulation. Moreover, this regulation is essential if we are to be able to levy a financial transaction tax – which is currently a subject of debate – on derivatives transactions. Although we have not succeeded in asserting all our demands, we believe that this report is absolutely worthy of our support. I would like to mention one more point that I considered to be particularly important: the reference to the problem of trading in food commodities and the associated speculation. We were only able to include this reference in the recitals; Mr Langen was prepared to do this. This point will come up again as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) progresses. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 – (DE)
 Mr President, our party has already given this matter some consideration, but I do not have enough time to go into things to any degree right now. We do have some ideas for different ways of working with the financial markets, and how the things that derivatives are used for can, to some extent, be achieved by other means. It would take too long to explain all this at this juncture. However, I should be happy to provide you with more information in this connection. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, I would like to move that we postpone the debate and the vote on economic governance to the July part-session. Our reasons for wanting to do so are quite simple. The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated. As MEPs we have not had sufficient time to have a proper look at these. The necessary translations were not available, either. We see this as unacceptable pressure being exerted by the Council and would ask you as fellow Members to resist this pressure and to vote in favour of the motion to postpone the debate and vote. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, too, call for economic governance in our programme for the European elections in 2009. However, the ideas that we on the left have of economic governance differ from those contained in the economic governance package that is currently on the table. For us, economic governance means laying down clear rules for the economy and setting boundaries. For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market. Naturally, for us economic governance also means effective regulation of the financial markets. None of this is to be found in the economic governance package. Instead, the current version of the package gives one the impression that it has come about mainly as a result of the pressure exerted by the credit rating agencies on the euro states of southern Europe. As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole. This radical austerity policy is currently driving citizens of Greece, of Portugal and of Spain, but also those of northern European countries, back into an ill-judged nationalism that we thought had long since been vanquished in Europe. The much-needed improvements on the Commission’s original proposals that were elaborated in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and voted through there – particularly in Mrs Ferreira’s report – have been largely removed again and toned down under pressure from the Council. In our view, the removal of the delegated legal acts from the Ferreira report is entirely unacceptable. As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with. This is reserved for the Commission. It bears little resemblance to democracy, and still less to a social Europe that is equipped to face the future. In our view, the economic governance package – at least in its present form – is the wrong answer to the crisis with which we are dealing. That is why we will not be supporting the package in its present form. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not so much about individual people; it is, first and foremost, about a selection process. Surprisingly, anyone who searches for information on the selection process for the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Internet will essentially only discover that the United States and Europe share the two leading positions. That means that the economically strongest nations, as a minority, share control of the global economy among themselves, so to speak. That is feudalism and has nothing to do with democracy, and that is why we cannot accept this. In our view, Dominique Strauss-Kahn stepping down presents a major opportunity to make fundamental changes at this point to the nomination and selection process and to make it an open, transparent and, above all, merit- and qualification-based selection process, as some NGOs have been calling for recently. This should also include a combination of majority votes from the members of the IMF and a majority of voting shares in the IMF. Up to now, only the voting shares in the IMF have been taken into account, which ensures a structural majority for the economically strong nations. This sort of reform and change to the selection process would correspond to the reform of the IMF, which would also correspond to the changes in global economic relations and would give the developing countries a chance to bring their experience with the IMF to bear in the further development of the IMF. In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty. Jürgen Klute,

 Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the core task of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is to promote the EU’s objectives through long-term financing of viable investments. This also means that the EIB is bound by the EU’s values; in other words, by social standards, transparency, high environmental standards, the development of a sustainable economy and the creation of jobs. However, we are hearing from NGOs involved in the local implementation of EIB-financed projects that it is by no means consistently ensured that these standards are met. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. The NGOs criticise the lack of transparency as regards the way in which loans are monitored across the EU and worldwide, how they are used and how they are reported on by the EIB’s financial intermediaries. To what extent is the EIB aware of these criticisms, and to what extent is the EIB actually looking into such criticisms? That is what we would like to know. From our point of view, at least some of what NGOs are calling for from the EIB is quite plausible: greater transparency as regards the granting of credit by financial intermediaries and the elaboration of clearer financing terms for financial intermediaries as well as efficiency criteria for the granting of loans. To improve transparency, NGOs further propose that environmental and financial information on EIB-financed projects be published before these are approved. In particular, EIB projects in third countries should be subjected to independent sustainability assessments in order to determine the economic, social and ecological impact of the project in question. However, there also appear to be other problems apart from transparency. Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental, social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs. Strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB’s financial operations. Projects that do not meet these standards should be excluded from support. Finally, I would like to make a comment on the subject of energy policy. It is pleasing that the promotion of a sustainable and safe energy supply is already one of the EIB’s current objectives. In view of the disaster involving the Fukushima reactor, the promotion of forward-looking, renewable, CO2
-free and nuclear-free energy production, as well as the promotion of energy efficiency in all areas in which the EIB invests, must be given the highest priority. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I think it is difficult to go into detail on this right now in view of the time available. However, I have a large number of reports from NGOs that I am happy to make available. I believe that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also familiar with these. These reports talk of how development aid is supported locally by the EIB in African and Asian countries and also make some criticisms of this. I am happy to make the reports available, but I cannot answer the question in detail right now. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I just wanted to provide a brief explanation. We have withdrawn Amendment 25, which related to the financial transaction tax. We have agreed with the other groups that we are able, and indeed intend, to negotiate in a more intensive and meaningful way within the Policy Changes Committee. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the call for a financial transaction tax is nothing new; opponents of globalisation have been calling for such a tax for some years. Just five years ago, however, hardly anyone would have thought that it might be possible to implement it in the foreseeable future. Yet this week, it is on the agenda of the European Parliament alongside a CO2
 tax and Eurobonds, and rightly so in my opinion. I can only welcome and support the financial instruments proposed by Mrs Podimata in her report, and I believe they will be voted through. These instruments are urgently needed. So far, the consolidation of national budgets has concentrated solely on cuts in expenditure. However, cuts in public spending primarily impact workers, pensioners and the poor; in other words, those reliant on the welfare state. The income side of public financing has been completely disregarded to date. It is the second lever that we can use to consolidate national budgets. In particular, addressing the income side would result in the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis shouldering an appropriate part of the public debt. If we are to consolidate national budgets, then it is quite simply imperative that we increase tax revenues. In fact, the high level of public debt is mainly a result of the nationalisation of private debt; in other words, of governments taking on the debts of private banks and financing the consequences of the financial crisis. The states are thus in no way solely responsible for the debt crisis. Asking the financial sector to dip into its own pockets is therefore not simply obvious; it is our political duty. A financial transaction tax would at last mean this sector shouldering part of this debt as one of the main perpetrators of the public debt crisis. This report would send out an important political signal were it to be adopted as presented. Similarly, we consider Eurobonds to be a sensible and, thus, also a necessary instrument. They will do more to reduce debt than all the sanctions and advice put together, however well meant. The complaints by some countries in surplus that Eurobonds would increase their interest burden are unacceptable since, at the same time, these countries in surplus are earning more from their exports to deficit countries. Some might criticise this as a transfer union. However, anyone who wants a social Europe – who wants the EU to continue to hold together in the future – must accept the idea of a transfer union at least in principle. Finally, I would like to say to the Commission that I hope that it will now finally present proposals for a financial transaction tax; we have been calling for this for over a year now.

 Support for small and medium-sized enterprises will safeguard numerous jobs and strengthen the innovation potential of the European economy. It is therefore absolutely right to ensure the reasonable provision of loan capital for these enterprises, as only then can they make the necessary investments. However, the increase in venture capital called for by the European Parliament is to be rejected on principle. Instead of placing banks under an obligation to support the real economy by providing appropriate credit, Parliament is calling for it to be easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to get contributions from investment funds and private equity firms on the capital markets. With a motto of ‘locusts for everyone’, the motion for a resolution calls in places for private equity firms to make it easier to do business with them. This would turn smaller enterprises in particular into the pawns of investors to an even greater extent than they are now. These investors are very often on the look-out for absurdly high two-figure profits, which they can usually only achieve by carving up the acquired enterprises and selling them off bit by bit.

 Mr President, Mr Chastel, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the last few months since the beginning of this year have shown the damage that credit rating agencies can do. There is therefore an urgent need for action. I, too, therefore welcome the directive, in particular, the fact that the supervision and registration of credit rating agencies will be transferred to ESMA. That is an important and positive step in the right direction. However, numerous good and progressive proposals fell by the wayside during the negotiations on the report. I would like to mention this once again. Thus, the appointment of ESMA remains the only real and positive change. The proposals for a public database for the issuing of credit ratings have been dropped, as has any reference to the establishment of a public credit rating agency. The consistent and continual examination of issued ratings by the supervisory authorities has also been forgotten about. Moreover, the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products. This, too, has come to nothing. I hope that these aspects will be taken into consideration in the reports on this matter that are still to come and that were mentioned by Mr Gauzès and by you, Mr Barnier. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, I would first like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Balz for such constructive cooperation. I can only emphasise the fact that despite coming from different positions, working together was a positive experience. Many people thought – and I would like to underline this fact again here – that the crisis in the euro area was over. Ireland shows that this is not the case. Just as before, Europe is voluntarily offering itself up to the financial markets. The EU Member States are still having to offer their treasury bonds in the bazaar of the financial markets and try to gain the confidence of the speculators by adopting suicidal austerity packages. At the weekend, we saw once again where that leads us. This time it was not the Greeks, who were supposedly out to deceive everyone, but rather Ireland – the star pupil – that was forced to turn to the European bail-out fund in order to rescue its banking system – a system which had also long been held up as a shining example of deregulation. In the meantime, the financial sector is already eyeing up Portugal for capitulation as its interest rates continue to rise. The European Central Bank must share the responsibility for this drama. It has failed and continues to fail to use eurobonds in order to offer a civilised alternative to this casino approach. While half of Europe is recovering from the crisis, the ECB idly stands by as the remaining part falls further and further into poverty and uncertainty. Ruinous cuts across the board by national economies may be to the taste of the European investment and banking giants, but they do nothing to help either Ireland or the monetary union and the ECB. Please pay no attention to Mrs Merkel’s simplified financial ABC, Mr Trichet. If you want to save the economic and monetary union, do not leave European treasury bonds hanging in the air. Introduce eurobonds before the speculators claim their next victim. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I admit that that is difficult to assess. I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that right now. Undoubtedly, it is a tricky situation, but I think that things have now developed so far that a rethink might possibly take place. I am sorry, but I cannot give an off-the-cuff answer to that question. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would like to make two comments. The first is addressed to Mr Gauzès. I would like to thank him specifically for his excellent work and cooperation. However, I also found the cooperation with the other shadow rapporteurs to be exceptionally good and constructive. I wanted to say that right at the start before I come to my points of criticism. I can, in principle, accept and reinforce what Mr Giegold has just said. I could have supported the first compromise that we agreed on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in May of this year. Indeed, I was able to go along with the decision. However, what has now been produced as a result of further negotiations is, also in the opinion of my group, no longer acceptable and we can no longer support it. As I see it, everyone is entitled to his own opinion on the matter, but in my view, the Council has played an unfortunate role here. I will express this a bit clearer than one or two others have done. In my view, the Council has missed an opportunity here. It gave in to a considerable extent to the financial market lobby and used everything in its power to prevent an effective regulation at European level. One morning, I received a call from a lobbyist, who said that if we really wanted to regulate private equities in this way, we would prevent development aid getting to Africa. A more absurd and obscure argument could not be found in this regard. These things have nothing to do with one another. Anyone who comes up with this sort of argument merely demonstrates the fact that he has no interest in meaningful and effective regulation. However, this is not the concern of Parliament. On behalf of Parliament – and I would like to emphasise this once again – Mr Gauzès and other fellow Members fought for an effective regulation. That was undermined by the Council. I want to say this once again; this is passive marketing. This is a point that Mr Giegold has already mentioned. It is like someone being prohibited from selling rotten eggs at the weekly market if he advertises them, but if he does not advertise the rotten eggs and just stands there and sells them, then it is evidently legitimate. However, it is no different to what has been laid down here in the section relating to passive marketing. It provides an opening. We have a European regulation – that has already been said and I think it is a good thing. However, when the door is wide open for it to be circumvented through loopholes, then the question arises as to how effective this European regulation really is. Private equities were originally regulated better. They are now relatively weakly regulated. A very important point – and here, too, I can only reinforce what Mr Giegold said – is the question of the information provided to the workforce. The original compromise stated that managers were obliged to inform their workforce of what they intended to do with the companies in which they had invested. What remains of this is the strained requirement for owners to inform their workforce and the works councils. You can imagine what will come of this – not very much. The Council has missed an opportunity here, and I hope that we will perhaps still be able to improve on it at a later date. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, economic governance as it is being developed here focuses solely on savings and competition policy. As has just been mentioned by the honourable Member from Spain, the problem of Germany’s orientation towards exports has not been addressed at all. Yet this is clearly a central problem, both in the euro area and in the European Union as a whole. German competition policy is being conducted to the detriment of internal demand in Germany. This is not being discussed at all. Above all, however, it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages. It is a wage battle – a wage competition. This wage competition is exerting enormous pressure on our neighbouring European countries, on European trade unions and on European workers. Neither the Commission nor the Feio report have addressed this problem. Any economic governance worthy of the name must take corrective action in this area rather than remaining silent. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank my fellow Members who have participated in rather tough and lengthy negotiations here. It is a tremendous achievement by the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs to have managed to do what they have done. They achieved the best result that it was possible to negotiate. Nevertheless, I do not want to hold back on the criticism that my group has, either. There are three points in particular that we are not happy about. On the one hand, the competences that have been granted to the supervisory authorities are, in our view, inadequate. We would have liked these competences to have been more extensive. We believe it is also wrong for the supervisory authorities to be split over several locations. We advocated combining them as far as possible in one location. That would certainly have made cooperation easier and more efficient. Mr Giegold has already mentioned that the staffing could, and should in fact, be improved in the long term. These are our main points of criticism. Nevertheless, we believe this to be a right and important step in the right direction, a right and important step towards a new regulation of the financial markets that is urgently needed. However – and this is simply our assessment – we still need to take some further steps in order to arrive at a truly effective new regulation of the financial markets, to get to a point where, through European regulations, we can prevent another crisis like the one we have just experienced. Our group will contribute greatly to this. There are, of course, a few more legislative initiatives on the way. We hope that these will bring more substance to this matter. If so, something truly effective and good could come of this. However, we really do still have a few more steps to take in this regard. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would just like to remind you that the rating agency Moody downgraded Greece again last night. We all know that the Greek Government has placed enormous pressure on its people in recent weeks, in order to get the crisis under control. We all know that the European Union has put together a package worth EUR 750 billion in order to support the countries that have found themselves in crisis and to help them out of it. Nevertheless, Greece has been downgraded. In fact, the same fate has befallen Spain, as well, because it, too, has been downgraded after adopting a savings package. Mr Barnier, you have just used the metaphor of a thermometer and said that it must not be broken. I do wonder, however, if a thermometer is really a suitable metaphor for rating agencies. A thermometer obviously does nothing to help improve the condition of the clients, the patient in question – which is something it just cannot do. After all, the thermometer is no drug and is obviously making the patient’s condition even worse. However, it is unacceptable that the countries which are making these efforts should end up being downgraded even further, despite everything they have done. This raises the question about what these rating agencies actually do. It has already been said that they failed to spot the crisis coming. Therefore, rating agencies did not help predict or diagnose the crisis. Shortly before it collapsed, Lehman Brothers received quite a positive rating. So, with the methods they used, they were not able or did not want to recognise what we had in store. In that respect, this instrument has been a total failure. Nor have they helped us manage the crisis. I have just given you a newspaper quote on that: ‘Ratings have not helped improve the crisis situation despite all the efforts made and there is concern’ – as the media put it – ‘that we will not be able to see through the packages we have put together’. This means they will pull us down and downgrade us even further. To conclude, I would like to point out that countries and companies are just not comparable. We have to take a closer look at these ratings. Just doing a bit of window dressing is not enough. What we need is a root-and-branch reform of rating systems. Jürgen Klute,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of this opportunity to take another look at the situation in Greece, because I believe that the crisis in Greece gives us an insight into the political status of the euro area. Firstly, however, I would like to make a remark about the calls from the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, to exclude Greece from the euro area, if necessary. My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, believes that this proposal is absolutely absurd. On the one hand, we are talking about a community with a common destiny. If we mean this seriously, then we cannot call, on the other hand, for a Member State to be excluded during the first large or moderate crisis that we have encountered. That is preposterous! Most importantly, this would be an admission of failure which would amount to kowtowing to the financial sector. The financial sector has shamelessly allowed itself to be bought out of the crisis by taxpayers, but we are now being asked to deny help of this kind to Greece. It will be difficult to explain to the pensioners and the workers in Greece and also in the other countries affected – according to the media, Portugal is the next country to come under scrutiny – why they are now being asked to pay up, having already supported the banks with their taxes. Taking this route would be the equivalent of driving the EU project into a wall. Despite all the justified criticism of Greece – and the Greek Members will realise that there is much to be done in their country – the crisis is by no means solely the responsibility of Greece. I would just like to point out that the majority of decisions on financial policy in the euro area have been handed over to the European Central Bank. The euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies. Major exporters such as Germany are forcing Greek economic policy to its knees. Therefore, this also represents a crisis in EU economic and competition policy. This is why we are calling for the ban on financial assistance for EU Member States to be lifted. The Member States in the euro area should make euro loans available, the European Central Bank should buy up debts in the same way that the Federal Service in the USA has done and credit default swaps should be banned. This is what we are calling for. (The President cut off the speaker) Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, I would like to comment on two aspects of the Turkish issue. It is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed, and rightly so. There is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain. However, what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in Turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights. The Turkish Government continues to oppose trade unions – in some circumstances even using the power of the police – which provide support for their members, in other words, for Turkish working people. This has happened recently in the dispute involving the Tekel workers. That is one of the comments that I would like to make. A democratic society must protect the rights of employees and trade unions and it is important to fight for these rights. The EU also supports these rights, in particular, in its role as a social European Union. The second factor is privatisation. Turkey is adapting to the EU and this includes the area of privatisation. The Tekel employees, of whom 12 000 are currently on strike, are threatened with the loss of their jobs or have already lost them as a result of privatisation. However, it is not only the Tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry. Around 500 000 people employed in growing tobacco in south-eastern Turkey have lost their jobs in recent years, with the result that, having been one of the major producers and exporters of tobacco, Turkey has now become an importer. A week ago, I had the chance to go to Ankara and speak with the Tekel employees. If the process of cutting jobs and destroying whole sectors of industry continues as a result of privatisation, the people of Turkey will lose their enthusiasm for accession to the EU. Therefore, we must put the focus on the social aspect of the EU. I would like to emphasise that once again. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

Madam President, I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years. Since the ban – we have only just heard about this – more than a thousand people have been arrested. I think that, in a country in which parties are routinely banned, it is no longer possible to talk of democracy. The prohibition of 27 Kurdish parties almost constitutes an attempt to be included in the Guinness Book of Records. It is not only about the minorities in Turkey – and this is something that I would also like to mention again at this point. There is currently a strike being held by tobacco workers at the firm Tekel that is very intense and is now escalating. Several thousand workers went on hunger strike today in order to enforce their rights. They feel they have been severely oppressed by the Turkish Government and the Turkish authorities. This aspect must be taken into account, because the protection of the rights of workers and trade unions is an integral part of democracy. The trade unions, but also the minorities, in Turkey are awaiting a clear and unambiguous opinion from this House. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL
).

 Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the previous speakers. I would like to remind everyone that the Colombian President also attempted to extend his term of office in breach of current Colombian law and, therefore, this matter should also be taken up. Most importantly, however, I would like to highlight the fact that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation in Germany, a foundation which has close links with the German Free Democratic Party, was involved in the coup in Honduras. There was a debate about this at least in Germany. The foundation’s scholarship holders distanced themselves from this policy in an open letter. We must not forget that Mr van Baalen is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Friedrich-Naumann foundation, it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua. I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances – and this has not been contradicted – a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind. In all honesty, we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe. What is happening here is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discredit and publicly shame those countries, states and governments in Latin America which are trying to introduce more social policies. On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to say clearly once again that we will not support this. Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the topic we are debating this evening has already been on the European Parliament’s agenda many times. It is well-known that, in its granting of aid, the Commission is guided by the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. That has been said a couple of times already. Against this background, questions have repeatedly been put to the Commission by the European Parliament. In November 2008, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present an analysis of the effects of the behaviour of banks that, at that time, had transferred their assets out of those Member States that had recently acceded to the EU. On 24 April of this year, the European Parliament repeated this request. It also requested to be brought up to speed about the declarations of intent between the Commission and the Member States receiving aid in which the conditions for the aid are laid out in detail. As far as I know, there has, as yet, been no response to these requests. Thus, my first question is this: is it correct that these requests have, as yet, not been answered? If so, then my second question is: why have these requests not yet been answered? My third question is therefore: when can we expect an answer to these requests? Jürgen Klute  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of the world economic crisis in which we currently find ourselves cannot yet be foreseen. We have to be aware that the crisis still has not hit the labour market with its full force. What does the European Union do in this situation, where more and more people are threatened by poverty and unemployment and fear for their existence? The European Union decides on new focal areas in its budget. Or, to be more precise, it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders, in favour of hi-tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe’s citizens. Believe it or not, there is to be an increase of 16% for the area of freedom, security and justice. The fund to secure the external borders is to receive 12% more funding next year. The expenditure on strategic military security research is being almost doubled and will now rise to a total of EUR 215 million. From the point of view of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, this means that the EU is taking leave of its founding idea of being a peace project for Europe. This draft budget instead follows the logic of the Treaty of Lisbon, with its obligation on the part of the Member States to constantly modernise their military apparatus and to secure the external borders. Europe’s Left instead demands that the European Union implement a consistent peace policy. Instead of an agency for armament, we call for a disarmament agency. Europe must concentrate its resources on civilian conflict resolution strategies such as a Europe-wide civilian peace corps and promoting independent research into peace and conflicts. In our view, this budget sets our sights increasingly on war instead of on crisis management and the Left in the European Parliament will not, therefore, support this budget. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council spring summit is traditionally devoted to discussing the economic and employment policies of the European Union, more recently in connection with the so-called European Semester. This year, however, the debate is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic situation in Greece. Greece is the ideal example on which to base a discussion about the failure of the economic and financial policies of the European Union. The predominant global policy of deregulation and privatisation has plunged the European Union into the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. As a result of this policy of deregulation, the global financial markets and also the commodity markets have got completely out of control or, more accurately, have fallen victim to speculators. The Greek crisis is also a result of EU policy, because the existing macro-economic imbalances between the Member States will be significantly exacerbated by the Europe 2020 strategy. These imbalances are what the financial speculators are now gambling on. It is not only Greece which is fighting for survival. A policy which has had such disastrous consequences in Greece and in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, needs fundamental changes. In fact, it must be reversed. Austerity measures are making the economic recession worse, as the fall in the gross domestic product figures of these countries has shown so dramatically. My group was strongly opposed to the Europe 2020 strategy and the imposition of one-sided austerity and debt reduction policies right from the outset. Instead, we need programmes to stimulate sustainable growth and to create jobs, together with programmes for investment, for the environment and for education. A policy which involves axing social services, abolishing social legislation and restricting fundamental democratic and parliamentary rights, while at the same time supporting the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, can only lead to outrage and social unrest. The Greek Government is losing its political base, the parties which belong to it are losing their members and the structure of society is collapsing. This is the result of Greek and European policy and it requires a fundamental change in the EU’s approach in favour of one which serves the interests of the people rather than those of the banks. One scenario could begin with the financial markets. Let us imagine that the European Central Bank (ECB) could lend money directly to the Member States via a public bank. This would enable the Member States to circumvent the international financial markets and to obtain the loans they need at favourable interest rates. No one could gamble on Greek, Portuguese or other bonds. All of the hype surrounding the markets would disappear. Does that sound appealing? All we need is the determination to take this step, and this is what my group is calling for. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the financial markets has led to developments on the markets that have not yet been brought under control. Only radical measures to prevent speculation on the markets will be able to put a definitive stop to the crisis. Instead of this, with the adoption of the Fiscal Compact Treaty we are seeing a further increase in the one-sided focus on austerity policy and the destruction of social cohesion. My group is strongly opposed to this radical approach of debt reduction and cuts in public budgets. It has even been criticised by the International Monetary Fund. The financial guru George Soros says that this austerity policy has thrown Europe into a deflationary spiral of debt. The debt brake was laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht and its adoption in national law is now intended to force its implementation. If that does not happen, the Member States are to be penalised with the help of the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union. That is absurd, and it is also undemocratic, as the Member States will lose their most important right: their budgetary sovereignty. Furthermore, it is totally unacceptable for the aid that is used to show solidarity with Member States which are in difficulty to be made conditional on signing up to the Fiscal Compact Treaty. This sacrifices the most important fundamental principle of the European Union on the altar of the financial markets. The Left will work to bring about a reversal of this disastrous policy. We need a pact for sustainable growth and employment. We need public programmes for investment in the environment and education and, above all, we need the European Parliament and the citizens to have a say. The Treaty must be approved by referendum or by public consultation. (Applause) Lothar Bisky  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, on October 30, our colleague Mr Meyer, a member of my group, was forcibly prevented from leaving the airport in the city of El-Aaiún in Western Sahara, receiving injuries from Moroccan security forces. The doctor diagnosed various contusions, problems with the neck muscles and dangerously high blood pressure as a consequence of the violence. This attack on a Member of the European Parliament is completely unacceptable. The President, the offices of the European Parliament and the national authorities have made representations to the Moroccan Government. So far there has been no response from Morocco. We cannot simply accept this without a word. I would ask for your solidarity. This outrageous incident is an opportunity for me to remind us all, yet again, that the people of Western Sahara have been suffering for decades as a result of the inability of politicians to bring about a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict. I believe that we can no longer remain silent. We should focus more on this issue in the second half of this electoral term. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the EU summit was supposed to bring about a breakthrough in the process of resolving the international financial crisis. It has undoubtedly not succeeded in doing so, because too many issues have been ignored and there has been a one-sided focus on reducing public debt and budgetary supervision. Even much of this was very unspecific. It may have given us a breathing space, but nothing more. The much-talked-about confidence of the markets cannot be regained by imposing an austerity policy based on the German model. The causes of the financial crisis are varied in nature, but the failure of independent bodies and, most importantly, the political system to manage or monitor the unregulated financial markets is the decisive factor. If we apply this standard, it is clear that the leading politicians of the 27 EU Member States once again did not want or were unable to take action. Increasing the financial power of the instruments which are intended to prevent speculation by bringing forward by one year the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) that amounts to EUR 500 billion, by continuing in parallel with the European Financial Stability Facility, and by extending the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with EUR 200 billion, will only guarantee that the banks will have their loans repaid and make a healthy profit on the interest. This is how the governments of the euro countries want to play the game with the financial markets, but they forget that they are in the weaker position. Most importantly, the failed attempt to leverage the rescue funds demonstrates the power and the powerlessness of the policy. The main opponent within the EU of regulating the international financial markets has gone into self-imposed isolation. Hopefully, decisive action will now be taken to tackle this problem, at least within the euro area and the EU Member States which want to join the euro. The first step must be to implement the international transaction tax quickly. Next, the most dangerous new financial products must simply be banned. This also applies to the activities of the shadow banks. The European Union can and must make progress and set an example in this area. If EU banks try to evade regulation in other parts of the world, they will be threatened with the removal of state rescue packages in the case of a crisis. Their business can ultimately be placed under state supervision or they can be nationalised. This would be an appropriate response to a systemic crisis. The consequences of the international crisis, which has been going on since 2008, are already unbearable for the vast majority of citizens. Young people’s plans for the future, provisions for the working population and the life’s work of millions of people have already been destroyed, with the most serious impact being felt, of course, in the crisis countries of Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. However, the citizens of all EU countries are affected by the excessive austerity measures. They are the culmination of the neoliberal policy of deregulation and privatisation and the redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top. This policy over the last 15 years is what has taken us into the crisis and, therefore, it must be stopped and reversed. We can only ensure that public interests are served and that the welfare state is maintained by restraining blind market forces. Austerity measures will not stimulate growth and will not lead us out of the crisis. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, the crisis merry-go-round is turning faster and faster and more and more euro countries are being pulled aboard. Even the countries with the best triple A ratings, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands, are feeling the adverse effects caused by the financial markets, which are playing cat and mouse with the euro countries. All the measures that we have adopted so far to regulate them have had hardly any effect. We can therefore legitimately ask whether it is time to change the rules of the game. However, the decision on this needs to be made by the EU institutions and not by means of intergovernmental agreements, such as those envisaged by Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy. The vicious circle of downgrades to countries’ ratings and rising interest rates has to be stopped. Therefore, we are making a decisive call for the evaluation of sovereign states by private rating agencies to be qualified and for the creation of an independent European agency. In addition, the European Central Bank must be allowed to buy bonds without restrictions. Ms Merkel seems to be ready to exchange her resistance to this for closer supervision of the budgets of individual countries and automatic sanctions. However, this involves allowing intervention in the sovereignty rights of individual states, in this case budgetary rights, which means that the inherent rights of national parliaments will be disregarded. In future, the Commission aims to be able to force countries to make social security cuts, lengthen working hours and increase the retirement age. I can only warn against implementing this policy. The results in Germany show that it puts a very one-sided burden on the majority of the population. Consequently, the social divide will become even wider. The low-wage sector now covers 20% of all working people. More and more people are finding themselves living in poverty in their old age. By contrast, a few rich people are becoming even wealthier. As a result of this policy, social equality is no longer functioning and society is threatened with collapse. I am opposed to a future of this kind for the European Union. Lothar Bisky,

Mr President, Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, as the example of Italy shows, where risk premiums for government bonds exceeded the critical mark of 7% for a while, the markets are relatively unimpressed by the decisions of the most recent European summit. The next euro area country is already in their sights. The increase in rates in Italy since October is not based on any trends in the real economy, and as the experiences of Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain in similar situations show, concentrated remedial measures from the EU and the IMF and the use of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) appear inescapable. That clearly shows that the measures we have adopted so far to regulate the financial markets do not fully take effect. I fear that, even with the new plans to strengthen the economic governance of the euro area, this will not significantly change. When I think of the package of European Commission measures that you have announced, President Barroso, with the five proposals for increased economic policy coordination, I cannot see the answer to the main question, namely do you have the courage and the ability to regulate the players on the international financial markets in such a way that, in future, speculative activity could be excluded as far as possible? Ecofin’s discussions on the financial transaction tax demonstrate that there is no political will in the Member States even for small steps. The finance ministers continue to answer global challenges with national thinking and proposed solutions based on the interests of their national banks. How big does this crisis have to get, how many countries need to be mired in it, and how big must the sacrifices of the populaces of the countries affected be before people see that we need to act? You propose, for example, issuing a Green Paper on Euro Stability Bonds. Much as I stress the necessity to introduce Eurobonds, I am astounded by the method. How long do you want to spend talking about the necessary minutiae of the shape to be taken by the mechanism? What effect will the time spent on the discussion process have on the markets? For me, these are the crucial questions. Instead, the monitoring of the budgets of individual countries is to be tightened up again. It is as if you believed that forcing austerity measures would trigger growth. In reality, however, the most pressing issue is the need for specific measures to improve growth and employment, with the resultant income and thus domestic demand. The austerity measures put in place in the crisis only serve to deepen it. The key economic figures for Greece, Portugal and Ireland for 2010 and 2011 surely show this. There is one question that, it seems to me, has not been given sufficient consideration, namely how can additional sources of finance be unlocked for these Member States? Their Government revenues need to be increased. Up to now, we have only heard proposals to cut social security payments, wages and pensions, or to increase VAT. The result of this is to stifle consumption by the mass of the population, and the fairness gap between the rich and the poor could become even larger. The citizens, too, can feel this. They do not see themselves as responsible for this crisis, and they are right. They are calling for social equality, including fair taxation. That is why there are mass protests in the Member States where austerity packages have been imposed. That is why there is political instability in the crisis countries, where numerous governments have already been swept aside. If the austerity course were to be made worse, the protests would also grow further. Where does that lead us? It strikes me that there is a complete lack of taxing the banks, the big corporations and the rich in the Member States. They could make a greater contribution to overcoming the crisis without difficulty. Tangible steps in this direction are required. That would give the citizens the feeling that the pain was being shared more fairly. However, that policy direction must also come from you, from the Commission, the Council, the Euro Group and other international institutions. It has been shown, after all, that the neoliberal mantra of tax cuts and reducing the regulation of market forces led to such terrible distortions that the entire global financial system is in jeopardy. A reorientation of thinking and approach is required here. We need a ban on short-term trading of credit default swaps, on short selling and of other high risk financial products. That is the order of the day. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were promised a bold move that would constitute a comprehensive solution to overcome the debt crisis. But what has the summit actually achieved? The Greek debt crisis has entered a new phase with the agreed haircut of 50%. This is something to be welcomed because it means that the country is freed from a significant part of its national debt. This is a positive outward signal and eases the situation for the Greek Government. This step does not mean a reversal in the downward spiral of the Greek economy, however. According to expert assessments, the country’s financial needs up to 2020 have already risen to EUR 250 billion. Likewise, this has not reduced the disastrous consequences for the people of Greece. In particular, the Greek banks need to survive the consequences of the haircut. They need extensive supports if they are to be rescued from ruin, otherwise it is not just the bond holders who will bear the cost, but also countless Greek citizens with their savings, pensions and other insurance cover. Much as I welcome the fact that the main culprits for the debt crisis are being called to greater account, this may be a risky move, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and for many ordinary savers. What assets will be levied by the banks? I believe that a socially just solution can more probably be achieved with nationalised banks, although a rescue or capitalisation of the banks should be made conditional on direct consultation or even more effective controls by the state. Banks in these countries should be recapitalised to the same extent as banks in France, Germany and other countries. The question remains whether the haircut will bring the much-vaunted lasting solution for Greece and the other endangered countries. Will this restore the trust of citizens and investors in the international financial markets? This is a question that I can only answer by quoting a famous phrase from Faust: ‘While I have heard the message– about the summit – I am not sure I believe it.’ When I think of the general strike and the further mobilisation of the public, I know that the Greek people have lost confidence massively. What is more, democracy itself is in huge danger, after all a government can only act against the opinion of the majority of the population for so long. This is a question that must also be answered by the IMF, ECB and the Council, in other words the so-called Troika, which has placed Greece under this austerity regime. My doubts also relate to the financial trick of leveraging the rescue fund. Although this will mobilise more financial resources, the question is at what cost? Countries are playing according to the rules of the financial markets and believe themselves to be in a strong position. If you will permit me, this is an illusion. The state debt crisis may not just spread very rapidly, but may also require massively increased commitments. This increases the risk to the taxpayer several fold. We must act decisively in bringing the power of the international financial community to heel, otherwise the crisis will spread. Everything is to play for. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of the crisis is becoming less and less transparent and more and more chaotic. The Council is starting to introduce pre-summits and main summits within the space of three days. Parliament is following the same rhythm and debating the results of the Council discussions twice during one part-session. It is already becoming clear that the big step forward that has been promised will not be happening on this occasion either. The only thing left to say is that the Council and the Commission are continuing to work on the principle of hope: hope that the new measures will generate sufficient confidence and that the investors on the international financial markets will be satisfied this time around. Why should they stop betting on future state bankruptcies? Why should they not try to draw Spain and Italy into the maelstrom of speculation? Only radical measures to prevent profitable speculation can stop this from happening. Until we bring in measures of this kind, the carousel will continue to turn and the Council will continue to propose rescue packages based on taxpayers’ money. The suggestion now is to use financial engineering tricks to leverage the agreed funding of EUR 87 billion for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). One German economist has referred in this context to a weapon of mass destruction, because the states which are showing signs of weakness require financing to the tune of EUR 4 trillion. The proposed haircut for Greece is inevitable. The only question is: who will bear the cost of it? Of course, it is right that the international banks should take on a greater share of up to 60%. However, it is important for us to prevent bankruptcies. This affects Greek banks in particular, whose very existence is under threat. After all the cuts in social security spending, do the Greek citizens now have to worry about the safety of their savings and bank deposits? Instead of a rescue package for the banks, we need a rescue package for wages, salaries, pensions and citizens’ savings. We need a public bank in the European Union which provides states with the necessary loans at favourable interest rates and excludes the private banks. We need public investment programmes to create jobs and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, since the last debates on the state of the European Union here in Parliament, the situation has come to a head. I would like to say that none of the proposals have been taken up and implemented. I recognise that the situation has become rather critical. That is perhaps our problem. We are a long way from a comprehensive solution. It seems as if the players on the financial markets are just telling themselves that they do not need to take all this very seriously and that they will just carry on regardless – and they are carrying on regardless. They are cheerfully betting on the interest rates for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds, while the credit rating agencies, which are caught in a conflict of interests, are fanning the flames by reducing the credit rating of Spain and Italy. Greater attention is now turning to those European banks, whose undercapitalisation poses a growing risk, as demonstrated by the Dexia bank, for example. The people of Greece, Portugal and Spain are organising mass protests against the drastic measures to reduce public expenditure. Unemployment, the situation among young people and the austerity measures are mostly burdening citizens rather than those who have caused the crisis, namely, the players on the unregulated financial markets. In our Member States, there is an increasing lack of confidence in the institutions of Europe. This week, marchers from Spain, the indignados
, are here in Brussels. They want to give expression to their protest against the consequences of the policy of privatisation and liberalisation, which has led to the excesses of the markets. This movement of dissatisfied people encompasses all of those countries that are placing the burden of the crisis on the shoulders of ordinary people. The clear failure of neoliberal policy affects not only the financial markets; it is clear here that speculating on rising and falling prices has long since reached other areas, for example, the global agricultural market and the commodities markets. The functioning of the real economy itself is at risk, because only a few large international companies can cope in a financially sensible way with the extreme fluctuations. Although we talk about it frequently, we have ended up in a hare and tortoise situation in which the market participants, representing the tortoise, proudly proclaim ‘I am already here’. I believe that if we want to take ourselves seriously, we need to ensure that we also discuss the follow-up to the debates. I would say that, in my opinion, nothing of any consequence has changed. If the sensible proposals that have been put forward here, including by Mr Barroso, cannot be put into practice, then the situation really is desperate. That is the crucial point of criticism that I would like to express. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, the European Union is undergoing its most serious crisis since it was first founded. This is something that we definitely all agree on. It is, of course, all about the economic, financial and debt crisis, about Greece and about the euro. The Member States and the European Union have not put in place sufficiently effective regulation of the financial markets. As a result, the policy is likely to end up at the mercy of the speculators. The measures which have been taken so far are aimed at budgetary consolidation by means of cutting spending. In concrete terms this primarily means reducing social security budgets. It means cuts in salaries and benefits, rising unemployment, falling public investment and a drop in real economic growth. More and more decisions are being taken on an intergovernmental basis without prior agreement with parliaments, but instead in agreement with bank bosses. As a result, the European Union is increasingly losing confidence and support. The eurosceptics are gaining ground and that is a fact. The European Union is in the midst of a crisis of political credibility. I believe that we are all of the same opinion in this respect. Mr Barroso, we do not entirely agree either on the analysis of the causes of the crisis or on the best ways of resolving it. Despite the need for criticism, I would like to emphasise that we on the left are aware of our responsibility for the European Union. The idea of European unity is a left-wing idea which has been defended by many left-wingers past and present. We will continue to defend this idea in the future and we will make sure that it is not surrendered to the profit interests of the markets and the speculators. I am convinced that Europe needs much more cooperation, rather than a further withdrawal into national interest. Europe needs a jointly coordinated, democratically legitimate, economic, fiscal and social policy based on solidarity. Therefore, we will support you, Mr Barroso, when you finally present the promised legislative proposals, which have been called for by Parliament, as the first steps towards comprehensive regulation of the financial markets, taxation of financial market transactions and Eurobonds in order to reaffirm the principle of solidarity in the European Union. We will continue to emphasise the value of solidarity between states and between people and the urgent need for it. Solidarity does not just involve financial aid. It also involves resisting the governments’ mania for austerity measures. As the main representative of a genuine European institution, you should be able to support our call for a step back from this culture of austerity. The fact that the social divide within society is growing much wider also seems ominous to me. The politicians are focusing on saving the banks and making available credit facilities of hundreds of billions of euros. However, the ordinary people are being left to pick up the tab for the failed policy of deregulation and privatisation. Huge austerity programmes are being imposed on them, they have to work longer hours and their wages and benefits are being cut. They are at the mercy of the governments’ austerity programmes. Social justice is simply being trampled underfoot and we cannot go on like this. The mass demonstrations in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain are making this quite clear. Finally, I would like to say that either we will take a joint route out of the crisis based on solidarity, which will allow the EU to emerge from the crisis in a better, more social, more sustainable and even more democratic form, or there will be no solution for the EU as a whole, with damaging after-effects that are hard to predict.

 Mr President, it is true that this is a different problem. However, I would like to make it quite clear where I believe the risks lie. I think I have explained that. We will not solve any of the problems of the 21st century by withdrawing to the level of the nation states. (Applause)
 This is why I am also defending the Community method. That is what I wanted to explain. Otherwise we need, of course, to differentiate clearly between all these things. However, the basis must be that the countries of Europe can come to a solution together. That is why the European Union exists. As individual countries they will not achieve anything and will slide back into the Middle Ages. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Juncker, tomorrow, this House will vote on the tightening up and expansion of the Stability Pact. If the package of measures goes through as negotiated, then public borrowing will be penalised in practical terms. The Member States will have to introduce extreme cuts and savings. My group believes that this is the wrong approach, however that is not important right now. My question to you is: what do you think needs to be done to improve revenue for the Member States? Do we not need urgent measures to bring to an end the ruinous race to reduce taxes in Europe with minimum tax rates for business profits and high incomes? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
I have a supplementary question. We believe that the European Central Bank is taking the right and responsible course by holding down interest rates for endangered EU States by buying up government bonds. Should we not finally abolish this taboo and approve the purchase of government bonds – provided, above all, that such purchases are subject to clear and transparent rules? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, none of the so-called crisis summits have produced solutions to the debt crisis and to the uncontrolled speculation. State aid is still being given to the banks and austerity measures are hitting the poorest people and the middle class hardest, particularly in the debt crisis countries, but also in Germany. This weakens overall economic demand, investment and social cohesion within the European Union. Despite many announcements, we have not succeeded in putting in place comprehensive regulations governing the financial markets. The citizens of Europe and the markets themselves obviously have doubts about the economic competence and the ability to act of those in power and of the EU institutions. I must make it clear right from the beginning that none of this pleases me. I agree with those Members who proposed that the EU constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon, should be revised. Before the treaty came into force, my group had already pointed out that it does not meet the current social, democratic and economic requirements and challenges. Please allow me to make a brief remark about the EU budget for 2012 and the medium-term financial plan, which we will soon be discussing. The more cuts we make, the less funding will be available for cohesion and structural policy, for supporting cultural institutions and for exchange programmes in the fields of education and research. However, it is precisely these policies which represent the added value offered by the EU, which allow the citizens of Europe to experience the EU at first hand and which represent the first moves towards a social union. In my opinion, anyone who calls this into question is putting the idea of the European Union at risk. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mr Tusk, the Polish Presidency may be able to offer some ray of hope in a time of crisis when there is little enthusiasm for Europe. A clear majority of the Polish people are positively disposed towards the EU, far more so than in many other countries. I very much welcome the openness promised in the Presidency’s programme, which includes better relations with our neighbouring states of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. As Poland’s western neighbour, Germany has had some positive experiences in relation to cooperation between regions close to national borders. There is a wide range of political challenges that we are all facing. In relation to the decisions on economic governance, we need more open, respectful cooperation between the EU institutions, in particular, between the Council and Parliament. In terms of substance, I can only reiterate that we need to start rescuing people, not just the banks. Let me say something on the reform of the EU budget. I do not believe that the budget can realistically be frozen for the medium term. Populist slogans like ‘It is time for the EU to tighten its belt’ clearly miss the point. In this time of crisis, the EU can and must demonstrate its added value by acting as an effective community based on solidarity and that is how I interpreted your speech. I believe that there is room for improvement in the agenda in relation to energy and climate policy. A new global agreement on climate change to follow on from the Kyoto Protocol will have to be reached in the coming months. The European Union must not slow this process down. I wish the Polish Presidency every success. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, if we look at Greece at the moment, we can also learn something. Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece. However, everything is just continuing as before. Before calling for commitments, yet more austerity measures and privatisations are being demanded. At the same time, the attempt is still being made, by means of the European semester, to push this bankruptcy experience as a model for the Member States. The whole situation has gone so far that we are considering the establishment of a privatisation agency based on the German Treuhand model. Mr Lange, the German Treuhand agency did a number of positive things. However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets. The consequences can still be felt today. I do not wish to represent this arrogantly as the mistakes of others, however. Billions in additional aid for Greece without a clear change of course are nothing more than a safety net for the banks. In this regard, we can also do without the voluntary participation of the private sector, so we are told. In that case, I would say that this is a political belly flop. Things will just carry on as before. The only alternative in my view is a radical change in our financial and economic policy. However, we lack the courage to do this. The causes of the crisis are not being dealt with. That is where the problem lies. We lack the courage to bring about more democracy and transparency and to conduct less political activity behind closed doors. This puts the European idea at risk and allows narrow-minded nationalism to gain ground. I would ask that clear signals be sent out from the summit, but the signal must not be ‘let us carry on as before’. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Garriga Polledo, you will understand that the Left has particularly high expectations in relation to the social alignment of the EU and is therefore a little disappointed that your report does not give greater priority to social aspects for the coming years. I am sure that the preservation and development of the European model of the social state and the European solidarity principle will be of enormous importance in times of crisis and economic cut-backs. Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process. Of course you have enumerated many important challenges, some of which go beyond the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I do not believe that the proposed tentative increase of 5% will be enough to meet these challenges. As Parliament, we should state clearly that we intend providing particular support for a social Europe. Other elements, such as ERD, FRONTEX and ITER may need to wait a little longer. I believe it is wrong to invite the Council to set negative priorities, in other words, cuts. At the same time, we must accept that this report will trigger serious parliamentary debate on the reform of the own-resources system. In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand. This is not just a useful financial instrument, but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the EU is financed. Naturally, this involves an important part of financial market regulation. I also believe that we need to do away with the British rebate and ensure that unused EU resources are returned to the EU budget. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr Barroso, I have just one brief question. I am pleased that the G8 summit and the e-G8 forum that preceded it discussed the Internet. There are also concerns about why those with power are concerning themselves with the Internet. We are aware of how sensitive this area is. Is there any more you can tell us in this connection? Is this a one-off, or will there be further discussion? Will you be putting this on the agenda again? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 My curiosity is still somewhat unsated on this issue and I would like to ask you if you would be prepared to tell us, in general terms, about these further negotiations concerning the Internet, as this is an important and far-reaching measure for the future. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism. To be honest, it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas, including in the Arab world, in Afghanistan, in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours. The question that I would like to ask is: What is the reason for this? With 27 different nations making decisions, how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy? It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests. However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past. The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests. The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms. The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya. Today, I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there. What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur? How can we give the 1.4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity? My group is particularly concerned with this question. The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common. They are all calling for justice and fairness, both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making, including international relations. The EU must respond to this demand. In order to achieve this objective, we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, my Group finds the results of the Council meeting inadequate. Firstly, let us consider economic policy. We have articulated our thoughts on the agreed guidelines in the area of economic policy in a hearing held last week. What we need is to overcome the neo-liberal practice of profit and competition fixing, evident in terms such as ‘flexicurity’, adjustment of retirement age, and so on. We believe that there is a need for democratically legitimised, controlled economic policy management that will prevent tax, wage and environmental dumping practices through appropriate common minimum standards that will provide effective regulation for the financial markets and prohibit the privatisation of profits, while at the same time passing on the risks to the public at large. My second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and Libya in particular. The EU Member States have become involved in a macabre situation in North Africa, particularly in Libya. We have already heard some criticism here. I would just like to emphasise one point: the dictator Gaddafi is using weapons purchased from us against the demonstrators and rebels. He is under fire from NATO troops apparently in order to protect those fighting for freedom and democracy, who are also using European and US weaponry. I would like to know the point of the existing code of honour in relation to arms dealing if such a situation can exist? Where is the support for freedom, human rights and the fight against social injustice in specific cases such as Lampedusa, where hundreds of refugees are arriving from North Africa every day? I fear that the newly cobbled together neighbourhood concept is more about European interests than an appropriate response to the needs of the partner countries. My third point relates to Japan. We still have time to discuss Japan this afternoon and tomorrow. Here too we fail to recognise a coherent European approach, at least as far as safety controls, the so-called stress tests, are concerned. I am not surprised that our citizens are asking with justified scepticism what exactly the European Union’s position is on this issue. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE) 
My question is similar to that of Mr Schulz. For this reason I intend to focus on a particular aspect. Naturally you will understand that, in the light of our experiences with the bank stress tests, we have become more sensitive about stress tests, including those relating to nuclear power. My question relates to Euratom. I do not wish to sit as judge and jury on the huge sums of money that Euratom swallows up on research. In my personal opinion, this research funding is being spent on a technology riddled with risk. I do not believe these risks are subject to adequate common controls, nor do I believe that there is sufficient scope for joint decision-making on this issue. After all, nuclear power does not respect national borders. That is precisely where the problem lies. Is it not the case that decisions on nuclear power should be taken on a joint basis because radiation recognises no boundaries? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, what would you think of the idea of establishing a European institution for promoting renewable energies, for the environmentally sensitive provision of energy and for energy savings within the framework of the EU Treaty? Do you think this proposal would be worthy of your support as it could rid us of the risks of nuclear power more quickly? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and monetary union without effective coordination of economic policy will not work. The Stability and Growth Pact has failed – on this many experts across party-political boundaries are agreed. The problem is that politics does not seem to have made much progress. In fact, no new political concepts are in sight. Let me remind you that the stability pact’s 3% limit has been breached 73 times since 1999, 46 times in a way that is barely tolerable under the Treaty – yet in not one single case has a penalty been imposed. This non-functioning pact does not need to be revised; it simply needs to be implemented more – or rather, it needs to be implemented in the first place. Naturally, every householder and every entrepreneur knows how important it is to have sustainable budgets. However, I fear that in the forthcoming decisions on economic governance and on the European Stability Mechanism it will be all about cuts. That is not the same as a sustainable budget. No state that is in so much debt as to be on the brink of insolvency can get out of the debt trap if it has to continue to finance this debt by borrowing at high interest rates. However much it saves, its debt will continue to rise – all the more so if wages, unemployment benefit and pensions have to be reduced, working hours extended, and public investment in infrastructure, education, health and so on cut back. If there is no consumption, then production will also collapse. Neither tightening up the Stability and Growth Pact nor the so-called strict conditionality of the future stability mechanism will therefore lead us to our goal. What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis-hit countries in particular, and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates. The mention of the necessity of reducing macro-economic imbalances will be problematic for so long as it is only demanded of economically weak states, while those that are economically strong are allowed to continue as before. Not only does the key word ‘solidarity’ not appear anywhere, but it has also been forgotten that expenditure and trade deficits on one side are income and trade surpluses on the other.

 Mr President, I find it remarkable that unease now reigns in the majority of the groups in this House in respect of approving the use of a fast-track procedure for the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This report clearly confirms our expectation as MEPs that any future crisis-management mechanism will not create parallel structures outside the Union and that parliamentary democratic supervision should be maintained at every stage. It is just that I find myself somewhat lacking in belief in this regard. Mr Barroso did make clear yesterday that he supports both the goal of social cohesion within the Union and the Community method. All the speakers agreed with him. Thus far, however, this has not been made into a motion for a resolution and that, it strikes me, is something lacking. What there was – or not – was the Merkel-Sarkozy pact. That awakens my mistrust and a certain degree of scepticism. For my group, it is clear that we cannot give our approval to any policy that aims to consolidate the budget by means of further cuts in the social sphere. The European Parliament must first be given a vote on the specific proposals for the Union’s future economic and monetary policy and the related mechanisms, as these are what this is about at its core. That, in turn, is such a fundamental decision that it must not be taken on the basis of ‘Europe by decree’ but only in accordance with the convention method laid down by the Treaty. My group is thus unable to vote in favour of what is, in many respects, a positive report. Ultimately, despite constant assertions to the contrary, this would, of course, set a precedent.

Madam President, Mr Barroso, I was pleased to note that you have appreciated the social dimension of this issue and have supported a social settlement. This will certainly be necessary. There is no need to repeat much of what my fellow Members have said as I am in complete agreement with them. I am extremely sceptical of the pact that has been presented by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. Why is this? Because their reasons for presenting it are not very clear. The fact that it has no validity is quite a different issue. They are both clever strategists. I cannot accept their claim that things simply happened this way. I believe that they mean things precisely as stated there. This is the point I would like to return to once again. I believe that this is a very serious issue. Although they believe that this clause on the indexation of wages and salaries is the right answer, I am not so sure. In black and white terms, increasing the pensionable age can also be described as a reduction in pensions. It will be extremely hard to reduce debt. After all, even countries like Germany find this very difficult. I can imagine that Ireland or Greece will find themselves in huge difficulty here. I am a little sceptical about what the proposed solution is supposed to achieve. I expect transparency in this matter. You will receive support from Parliament if you play your part in promoting greater transparency and ensuring that games like this are not played out behind Parliament’s back. If these people want to make social security cuts, they need say so clearly, rather than taking countless detours to reach an objective that you, Mr Barroso, do not share and that we certainly do not share. We are prepared to discuss the concept of coordinated European economic governance with you provided that this economic governance is worthy of the name, in other words, that it is democratic in structure and that it will help establish a sustainable, socially responsible European community. We are also willing to discuss amendments to the Treaty, for example, in relation to a social progress clause. However, we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation. This is the only way that Parliament can monitor this process. It cannot be done without information! Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Mrs Harms mentioned something important yesterday. Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations. One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis. Quite the contrary – it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place. It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact. This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms. In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens. It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts. Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible – all of this means wage restraint and cuts. It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society. In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt. It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey. This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support. However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy. Yesterday’s debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point. We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century. Nobody wants that. Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has only been in existence for a short time. However, it is now going to be modified for the second time in just a few months because of what is alleged to be an urgent matter. As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure. We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament. Now the Council is once again under time pressure and many Heads of Government want the new Treaty modification to be implemented using the supposedly tried and tested fast-track procedure. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left opposes this approach, which is threatening to become a standard process, and is calling for Treaty modifications to be managed using the normal procedure, including the convention, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make some brief remarks about the media law. Many speakers have mentioned this, but I will not repeat what they have said. I would just like to make one point. This is not interference in Hungarian affairs. I believe, and I have only learnt this late in life, that the media are responsible for monitoring those in power and the economy. This situation must remain unchanged. Therefore, the media must not be monitored themselves by other higher level bodies and a media authority of this kind would make this possible. For this reason, the composition of the media authority is, in our eyes, not ideal. You have clearly stated that you are prepared to change this and I hope that you do move in this direction. Otherwise, and I would like to make this quite clear, it is a Hungarian affair. Of course, there are other Member States whose media legislation we could mention in this context. This does not only relate to Hungary. I would like to say quite clearly with regard to your plans for the Council Presidency, firstly, that I welcome the fact that you have made promoting cultural diversity one of your overriding objectives. I believe that this is very important. I look forward to your initiatives to improve integration, including the integration of minorities, and you yourself have referred to the Roma. A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue. Secondly, I am pleased to see that you are committed to the enlargement negotiations and the policy with regard to our eastern neighbours. Bringing more Eastern European culture, together with the historical and social experience of the area, into the European Union can only be a good thing. For many reasons which I do not want to go into here, the European Union is still primarily a Western European institution. I would like to see your Council Presidency exerting a greater Eastern European influence. Thirdly, I will be interested to see how you handle the forthcoming reorganisation of agriculture and cohesion policy and the preparation of the European Union’s multiannual budgetary perspective. My group calls on you to ensure that Parliament is fully involved in all of this and we expect you take seriously your promise to support small and medium-sized businesses and to improve environmental protection, the sustainable use of resources and food security. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr Barroso, we are all aware of how important the stability of the euro is. That being the case, there is one event that I found myself not quite able to understand. This was the debate about the increase for the rescue package, where you gave the green light but Chancellor Merkel gave the red one. My question, therefore, is whether you do not coordinate with one another at all. I appreciate that such things do happen sometimes, but this is not the first time that I have come across or heard about something like this. The media have taken a great interest in this in the meantime. Yet this is not a mere domestic quarrel between you and Chancellor Merkel. It is an important political issue. I can understand that – believe me, I do not always see eye to eye with the Chancellor, either – but the issue concerns whether such publicly differing opinions do not help the financial speculators. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion, and the report. My question remains, however – on such an important issue, where the euro is being speculated on, at a point in time as important as this one, how can it be that your opinion comes across as uncoordinated with Chancellor Merkel or President Sarkozy or other Heads of Government? That is the public perception, in any case. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been dealing with the global economic and financial crisis for three years now. One of the conclusions to be drawn from this long-lasting discussion is that our measures are obviously not tackling the roots of the crisis, but simply treating the symptoms. I would like to repeat once again that decisions at EU level must not be determined by the financial markets. We must not allow the banks to get away largely scot-free, to continue speculating and to leave the Member States to take responsibility for the risky transactions that the banks have entered into. The tough austerity packages imposed on Greece and Ireland will result in the people bearing the cost of the crisis which they did not cause. This will restrict consumer spending and prevent the necessary economic upturn from taking place. Drastic savings measures will put other countries that are currently at risk, such as Portugal and Spain, in the same position as Greece and Ireland. Simply readjusting the financial instruments or putting new safety nets in place will not help. A permanent mechanism for preserving financial stability must include measures which regulate the activities of the markets. These include, among other things, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and an obligation to meet minimum social standards. It is also important for us to change the statute of the European Central Bank to allow it to provide direct financial aid for ailing states, while circumventing the banks. These are the first steps we should be taking, but they are long overdue. To make the situation absolutely clear, a narrow-minded national approach is blocking the regulations needed for effective control of the financial markets. The Heads of State or Government are preventing us from making progress in the right direction. I include the Chancellor of Germany among them. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in response to Mr Schulz’s questions, you said that the Eurobonds proposal will probably not be successful. Previously, we were told that nothing would come of the financial transaction tax, and other proposals have also come to nothing. We are now in the third year following the financial crisis and I am now asking myself whether you would be able to agree to boosting the euro rescue package – that would, of course, be an additional measure – or whether we have to expect that, by the weekend, yet another set of proposals will be rejected by you and others. My question is: how expensive is this delay, especially as it is clearly costing a lot of money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, Mr Barroso, I just have a brief additional question: are there any other instruments that are still under discussion? I feel rather poorly informed in this regard. Something needs to be done, and we are probably in agreement that the instruments that we have at our disposal should actually be used. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group
. – (DE)
 Mr President, if the Heads of State or Government have agreed to create a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area, I can only welcome that. The results of the work, lasting several months, of Mr Van Rompuy’s Task Force on economic governance leave a great deal to be desired – although my views on them vary. The attempt is being made to carry out as stringent a control on the budgets as possible in order to avoid long-term deficits, but the cautious recovery from the crisis will immediately be put at risk again by the radical cutting of public expenditure. That is not only completely counterproductive, I also think it is absurd. It seems that we have learnt nothing from our past experience with the Stability and Growth Pact. You cannot impose additional monetary penalties on a country that is already heavily in debt. The bail-out ban and the Stability and Growth Pact destroy the solidarity between the States in the monetary union. Does the economy dictate our policies? Once again, the consequences of the crisis will be borne by the people. We can expect wage dumping and social dumping, cuts in the education sector and a rise in unemployment. This will further increase the burden of the countries affected and make their recovery more difficult. It makes absolutely no sense to increase the pressure on countries like Ireland, Greece or Portugal. Rather, the large economic disparities in Europe should be reduced, in other words we need economic governance. We want a social and fair Europe, built on the principle of solidarity. The precedence of policy over economy must be retained or restored. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to express my sympathy for the victims and for those affected. All the groups in Parliament are in agreement on this. We also agree that we must provide aid quickly. A lot of sensible things have already been said. It is not necessary for me to repeat them, but I do fully support them. There is one further aspect that I would like to highlight and that is the long-term damage. We must not forget that many of the consequences will have a more lasting impact on the natural environment than we may currently anticipate. Therefore, it seems important to me for the Solidarity Fund and the measures that we are taking to be targeted at these long-term consequences of natural destruction. I would like to make one last point. We can sit here and discuss this issue, but the most important thing for us to do is to provide support, so that people can begin to organise help for themselves, because they have a better understanding of the local conditions than we do here in Parliament. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon have emphasised the fact that it does away with the democratic deficit in the EU. In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control. The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard. I repeat: it is a minimum standard. This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism. It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets. New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent. When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament. The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States. Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe. The net contributors seem to have forgotten this. While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe. Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage. The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued. In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget. We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity. This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States. It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities. To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8)) Lothar Bisky  (GUE/NGL

 – (DE)
 Mr President, I understand your economic questions, Mr Rübig, and they are very profound in economic terms, which I respect. However, I believe that this is about the relationship between the budget and the European Parliament and its rights. That is a different subject. It has to do with products, but in a quite different sense. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I have to admit that the Treaty of Lisbon and its social commitments read well. However, we cannot ignore the fact that hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Brussels and other European capitals. They were protesting against a mistaken and unsocial policy towards the crisis. We have hardly begun to turn the corner from this, the worst of crises, yet we are already hearing from many governments that national debts need to be reined in. The emergency parachutes that are the rescue plans need to be folded away, they say, and investment programmes abolished. The Commission is calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be tightened up. States in which reasonable wages and salaries are paid, in which the labour market still follows rules, or in which social security systems are too ‘social’ – which means too expensive – are to be penalised. The banksters are carrying on as if nothing had happened. Pensions and wages are to be cut, consumption taxes perhaps increased. Contributions to social health insurance are rising while services decline. In the light of the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking, Laval and Rueffert cases, it is not only the trade unions that fear that the social balance of the European Union is in a precarious position. The call of the trade unions for a social protection clause deserves our full support. Employee rights, trade union rights and social protection need to be given at least the same significance as – and, indeed, precedence over – the internal market and freedom to provide services. This needs to be clearly laid down in primary law. I am pointing out these facts because the relevant paragraphs merely look good – in reality, they change nothing. Human dignity cannot be ensured without minimum social standards. A social progress clause would improve the badly damaged reputation of the European Union amongst the populace and help to stem social fears. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have provided an impressive insight into the tasks of the various policy areas. Nevertheless, you, and all of us here, have to admit that the trust of European citizens is fading. Mr Verhofstadt has drawn our attention to this and so I will not address the matter in any more detail. These are reliable studies. Citizens have also seen rescue and economic recovery packages amounting to billions of euro flow to the so-called system-relevant banks, and they have seen dangerously high national debts pile up everywhere. Now they are asking themselves who is responsible for this, particularly when, despite a better economic outlook, they are being hit by the Member States’ austerity measures. These austerity measures will result in rising prices for public services, cuts in social benefits, cuts in education services, pay cuts, an extended working life in the face of uncertain pensions and often precarious employment situations. The protest goes far beyond the states hit by the crisis. Today, the unions are striking in France and on 29 September, strike action will be taken in many towns and cities in Europe against the Member States’ austerity policies. Citizens were promised that the Treaty of Lisbon would make the European Union more social and more democratic. The EU, including the Commission and the Parliament, would simply lose credibility if it now said that the Member States are responsible for the austerity measures. Effective financial market reforms, for example, like a ban on hedge funds, or a ban on speculation on raw materials and food derivatives, or even a financial transaction tax, but also the move away from the flexicurity ideology, are now most definitely the responsibility of the European Union. This is something that we all need to involve ourselves with over the next few months. The situation in the Union varies greatly for the different sections of the population and it is full of inconsistencies. The social division in the societies of the EU countries has, in any case, widened dangerously once again. In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, a large amount of money, billions of euro, have gone to rescue or to stand as security for the banks. It has not reached the people with real social needs or been put into education. No one would want to dispute or belittle the EU’s successes. However, papering over the very real inconsistencies in the European Union will not help anyone. I, too, would like to finish by saying something about the Roma in France. I believe that the European Union has a good tradition. However, anyone who wants to combat social anxieties at the expense of a social minority, and indeed using unfair means, is abusing his political powers. I want to make this very clear: the abuse of social anxieties is simply unacceptable for a Community that always makes a point of standing up for universal human rights and moral values. These moral values and human rights apply to French, Polish, English, Spanish or German people in the European Union, just as they do for all Sinti and Roma who live in Europe. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I would like to come back to what Mr Barroso so rightly said against racism and xenophobia. However, in this regard, I would like to say that I am still not satisfied with the debate about the Roma, which we will, of course, continue this afternoon. There are side issues being debated that are extremely dangerous. In Germany, for example, we currently have the Sarrazin debate, which is extremely problematic. In this regard, the fact is being overlooked that in Germany, there are poorly educated sections of the population – of Germans, immigrants and also of Roma and nationals of other countries – who are all relatively poorly catered for in schools and we have insufficient means and a lack of smart methods to be able to really help these children. This breeds racism. Finally, I would like to say that sometimes, racism can arise unintentionally. I would not like to forget the debate about Greece. In this regard, I have seen things in my country, which is not particularly xenophobic, that I had not thought possible. We must remain sensitive to nationalistic, xenophobic and racist statements in the European Union. (Applause) Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for averting imminent crises, involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy, which entail rescuing the banks, on the one hand, and cuts in social security, salaries and pensions, on the other, we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. In our view, these proposals from the Commission on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact are taking the wrong tack. The Commission, following in the footsteps of the working group headed by President Van Rompuy, does not want to modify the Pact’s content, but instead wants to tighten the sanctions and enforce compliance. Both the Commission and Council are calling for further controls and penalties for Member States in deficit. This has not worked in the past and will not work in the future. However, we in the European Parliament’s Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left are pleased, at any rate, that the harshest penalties proposed by the Commission for countries in deficit were not applied. Regulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency. We will do our part to resolve the situation. Europe’s citizens already have to pay; the Council now ought finally to swing into action as well. The problems with the Stability and Growth Packet are not down to lack of compliance or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit to the Maastricht target of 3% of new debt. This may stall growth in the euro area, which is still feeble and at risk. The current economic imbalances in the EU must be eliminated, as this is what speculators are making their living from. One of the ways to do this is for the countries with strong economies to drop their aggressive export strategies which have devastating consequences for the other countries. These countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead. Criteria such as the unemployment rate and the prevalence of poverty must be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. What is needed is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the results of the meeting of the European Council on Thursday of last week must be measured against the global and European challenges that we are facing. Will it be possible to eliminate the causes of the unprecedented crisis in European financial markets at the beginning of May or at least to start taking steps in the right direction? What proposals are being made to the citizens of Europe and the financial markets to rectify the malfunctions in the system? The Council has proudly stated that the banks, which are responsible for causing the crisis, must pay part of the costs and their activities must be more strictly regulated. I welcome this, but in the meantime, I have stopped believing that it will actually happen. You have decided first of all on an international bank levy which does not have unanimous support even within the EU and which has been completely rejected by some G20 countries. It seems unrealistic to think that this decision could ever be implemented. Secondly, in the case of the introduction of a general financial transaction tax, there is only a requirement to investigate whether it is feasible. I doubt that this will really boost the confidence of the players on the global financial market or prevent speculation from taking place or cause the G20 to adopt a resolution on this subject. Thirdly, the stricter measures taken against deficit offenders in a financial and economic crisis are more likely to put the recovery at risk, reduce consumer spending and, in particular, cause socially deprived people to tighten their belts even further. As a result, a greater reduction in the state’s revenue base is inevitable. This will lead to additional austerity measures, which will call into question the financial viability of the Europe 2020 strategy that we have just adopted. Fourthly, no one is taking the opportunity to reinforce the Member States’ revenue base by introducing an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds and green taxes, by raising taxation on high incomes and assets and by ensuring the socially just distribution of taxes. I find this very strange. My fifth point is that the crisis is undermining the democratic foundations of our society. The regulations imposed by the EU on the countries in crisis are also contributing to this. Cuts in social security spending, in wages and pensions and in public services, together with the raising of the pension age, are all causing the poverty gap to widen and the number of people living in poverty to increase even further. I am very much opposed to this. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticism from our group is not directed at whether we need the newly created euro rescue package, but at how it will be implemented. As in 2009, it is once more all about rescuing the banks and the financial sector. Yet again, they will not be helping to pay the cost of averting imminent crises. The EU countries that are in difficulty are once more being ordered to make cuts in social security spending, in public investments, in public services and in salaries and pensions and to increase the pension age. The plan to tighten up the stability pact is pure sado-monetarism. Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are being asked to pay for the crisis which was caused by the failure of European economic policy and gambling on the financial markets. However, this orgy of cuts will send demand on the internal market and tax revenues in Europe through the floor and, as a result, the recession will return. From our perspective, this policy is fundamentally wrong and will not lead to healthy public finances. We are hearing once again that structural reforms should bring about increased growth. More deregulation is to be introduced into the labour markets and the European internal market, while public services will be privatised by means of public-private partnerships. As a result, industrial relations will end up in an even more uncertain and precarious position. This will cause an increase in poverty and social exclusion in the very year when we are supposed to be combating these two phenomena. This is what the Europe 2020 strategy is allegedly intended to fight against. Where will the investment in education, research, green jobs and combating poverty come from if all the Member States are adopting austerity programmes? To put it bluntly, the Europe 2020 strategy is not worth the paper which its very modest objectives are written on. Our group supports the protest campaigns by trade unions and social movements against the catastrophic course taken by the European Union. We agree with the European Trade Union Confederation that an EU-wide tax on financial transactions, Eurobonds, green taxes and heavy taxation of high incomes, assets and inheritances will allow for investment in the environmental and social reconstruction of our industrial societies. Firstly, Europe needs a European social and environmental programme of investment in the future to overcome the crisis. Secondly, it needs decisive measures to break the power of the financial markets and, thirdly, it needs European economic governance and more economic democracy in the interests of the workers. We must have a social Europe or there will soon be no common Europe left. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, the most recent Council meetings indicate that far-reaching changes are under way. We are currently experiencing a process of governmentalisation of European policy. The Treaty of Lisbon praised the role of Parliament and the strengthening of that role. We have also spoken out in praise of this. Fundamental agreements are now being reached between the governments and inconceivably large amounts of money are being spent. Until now, the parliaments have had little say in the matter and we must put a stop to this. The method used by those in government has resulted in huge sums being spent to rescue banks which are themselves responsible for getting heavily into debt. These governments have saved casino capitalism using taxpayers’ money. However, they have taken a very hesitant approach to rescuing the states that are in debt. Somewhere, they managed to find EUR 750 billion. The question is whether the money printing press will save economic development. I believe that it is more likely to save the banks’ capital. However, the European Union must be more than just a free internal market with a single currency. Mr Barroso is right when he says that without an economic union, we can forget the monetary union. However, I cannot yet see any clear outlines. Persisting with the failed Stability and Growth Pact has relatively little to do with the sensible coordination of economic policy. What we are lacking is a social union. We are lacking the lasting and effective re-regulation of the financial sector. We are lacking a coordinated tax policy and wage policy and a tax on financial transactions. Although we have been talking about this tax for a long time, it remains just talk. It is time to safeguard the social state by means of the EU institutions, not to dismantle it. The Greeks and other nations are afraid because they can see the measures that are being taken on the social side. It is time to fight for the harmonisation of social standards at a high level. Hedge funds must be banned and tax havens abolished. We are making very slow progress in combating the crisis in the financial markets. In the light of the speed with which the speculators are acting, we are doing far too little. During emergencies like those that we are repeatedly being faced with, it is totally wrong to nationalise the billions which are being spent as losses and privatise the profits. The banks must not be allowed direct access to taxpayers’ money with the support of the state. Incidentally, one thing is clear to me, and that is that in the current conditions, we will have to redefine the term ‘bank robber’. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must, of course, provide assistance to Greece. However, the so-called rescue operation also has some absurd elements. With France and Germany acting like great powers, the process of reaching a decision on the assistance package was very expensive and protracted. For years, the financial markets have been increasingly deregulated and now everyone is surprised that it is expensive. Who will now pay the price for the political errors? The workers, ordinary citizens? Banks are not being placed under any obligation. No, once again it is the taxpayers who are to pick up the tab and dig deep in their pockets to pay for the profiteering of the banks. Once again, dependent workers are to have to accept pay cuts. With the dictates from the International Monetary Fund, any semblance of a democratic decision-making process has been eliminated. In the case of the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico, application of the polluter-pays principle has been called for. I believe that is right. Anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt. At the moment – at least in Germany – banks do not even have to pay back the debts that they have taken on and with which they are happily speculating against the euro – yes, against the euro. Furthermore, they are still speculating, even though we have been saying for a long time that something needs to be done about this. Proposals for what could be done are on the table. A ban on trading credit derivatives and on short selling, the introduction of a financial market transaction tax, special levies on bonuses in the financial sector, a legally binding bank and insurance levy – all of these proposals are on the table. Of course, Greece must also do its homework. Like other countries of the European Union, Greece should also tax wealth, combat corruption and reduce its arms expenditure. Mr Cohn-Bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this. I will therefore omit the facts in this regard and endorse what he said in his speech. I can understand people in Athens going out into the streets and protesting. What I cannot understand is the violence. I agree with everyone who has expressed sympathy for the victims, whose suffering is most regrettable. Violence will achieve the opposite of what the protesters and honest demonstrators want. We must call for an end to the violence. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the decision made by the aviation safety authorities not to put passenger safety at risk was absolutely right, even if this meant closing European airspace for several days and involved financial losses for the airlines. In my opinion, it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk. What does ‘at their own risk’ actually mean in this case? I welcome the fact that the Commission is considering authorising special State aid for the airlines, which would otherwise be in serious financial difficulties as a result of the current situation. We will be talking later about employment in the European Union. If the EU and the Member States can at least help to prevent things from getting even worse, this is the right thing to do. However, in return for the provision of State aid, the airlines must give a binding undertaking not to make staff cuts or salary cuts. They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation. It is high time that the Commission put in place a permanent common European monitoring system for aviation safety. This monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping. I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach. Competition and the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to take priority over the safety of human lives. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr Barroso, you have spoken about your work programme and it has been discussed in Parliament. You have said that you want to follow up on the critical remarks. I have one question. Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it. However, I have the impression that very little has changed in the way the banks do business. I would also be interested to hear the answer to another question. Do you think that we and the Commission have done enough? If not, what do you believe it is still necessary to do in order to combat the causes of the financial crisis in the longer term, so that the banks cannot go on doing business in the way they currently are? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr Barroso, I have another brief question. The chair of Deutsche Bank, Dr Ackermann, is a difficult man to make an impression on. He has recently said outright that he wants to make returns of 25%. Do you not think that this flies in the face of the measures taken by the Commission and the individual governments? He is not changing anything. He has said that he wants to make returns of 25% once again. This is what Dr Ackermann, the chair of Deutsche Bank, which is an extremely important bank, is saying. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, it is a good thing that the Heads of State or Government were able to agree an emergency package, but this is hardly a really European solution. The German Government has, for tactical electoral reasons – with regard to North Rhine-Westphalia – gone quite far down the road of populism. The agreement, then, was hanging by the thread of the conversation between Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. It is no package to cover the citizens. The objective of the funding mechanism is to consist, and I quote, of ‘incentives for the fastest possible return by the financial market to setting high-risk prices’. Economic policy coordination is to be built on the failed principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. The State and the citizens are to make savings, while the financial markets – the banks – are to evaluate whether enough savings have been made. I regard that as a dubious procedure. In the EU there is currently an unemployment rate of 10% – the highest since 1998. Over 20% of under-25-year-olds are out of work. There is a need to say very specifically where we want to make savings. Otherwise, I fear the worst. Why has the Council not agreed on an increase in the cohesion and structural funds or an immediate prohibition on trading credit derivatives? Why has it postponed agreement on specific targets to combat poverty in the EU indefinitely? I am not saying, incidentally, that they have done so deliberately, but to all intents and purposes the postponement will endure indefinitely. I consider that to be a scandal in this, the European Year for Combating Poverty. June this year is much too late. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, it is rare for me to agree with the President of Parliament and the President of the Commission. However, when they both call for solidarity with Greece and warn of renationalisation, then I can only agree with them, because what they say is correct. Moreover, recently in Strasbourg, we heard Mr Barroso thinking aloud as to whether the worst of the speculation on the financial markets should be banned outright. The increasing social chasm in the European Union and within the Member States can no longer be overlooked by anyone, yet the pressing issues associated with this are not on the agenda of the Heads of State at their first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The debate on the EU 2020 economic strategy is naturally already on the agenda. As you are aware, my group is not at all keen on this strategy as it has been drafted by the Commission, because it is based on the failed ideology of competition which led to the crisis. We want a strategy for Europe that gives social and ecological needs priority over competitive interests. EU 2020 is miles away from this. It is quite something, however, when individual members of the Federal German Government turn up and thunder against the few binding goals of the EU 2020 strategy, such as for the employment quota, for research and education and for combating poverty – and that in the European Year for Combating Poverty! I hope that this attitude will not prevail among the majority of the Heads of Government. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 Mr Barroso, last week you presented your proposal for an economic strategy. It contains important objectives. The Council has now imposed an austerity programme on Greece, which, in my opinion, makes the achievement of these goals impossible, with one State having 3% of the gross domestic product of the EU. However, you continue to persist with the failed Stability and Growth Pact. At the same time, several Member States are calling for a European monetary fund or even economic governance. My questions are as follows. Are you going to review your EU 2020 proposal again in order to integrate the idea of the monetary fund and economic governance so as to initiate a move away from tax and wage dumping and from the prevailing competitive ideology? Are you going to take measures immediately, together with the Member States, to prohibit speculation against the euro by the very banks that have just been bailed out using taxpayers’ money? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. 
– (DE)
 I am not entirely satisfied. The issue is that taxpayers’ money is being used to speculate against the Greek State. Some of this taxpayers’ money comes from German banks and it has also been lent out by German banks. Yet, while we are repeatedly told that some sort of measures will be taken, nothing actually happens. I am therefore rather disappointed that so little has been done to simply prohibit certain things in the EU so as to put a stop to such speculation once and for all and allow us to genuinely concentrate on growth and employment. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, in times of need, you discover who your friends are, as the saying goes. There are 27 governments in the European Union trying – each in its own way – to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries. This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens. The euphemistic wage restraint policy, reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age, family, sickness and desired education have all been mentioned. The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets. The banks have already made more progress than the states. Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank, which, in Germany, were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers’ money, are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of excessively expensive government bonds in Greece. Taxpayers’ money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal, honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer people are fleeing. (Heckling)
 Believe me, I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany. However, one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief, while at the same time, the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes. Who will have to find this money, though? I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet. Was it not Germany, formerly the world’s highest exporter, that years ago separated wage increases from productivity, thus resulting in social dumping? In ancient Greek theatre, a crisis means an opportunity – yes, the challenge of a turning point. In order to bring about such a turning point, we must demand that a statutory minimum wage finally be put in place. The same work in the same place must receive the same wage. We need harmonisation of tax types within the Union, but above all, we need genuine European regulation and control of the financial markets and a real European economic and finance policy, coordinated on the basis of solidarity, with binding social and environmental targets. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT agreement was negotiated on the basis of a dubious procedure and quickly pushed through only one day before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to circumvent Parliament. However, I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement. We have big brother’s little sister waiting for our approval. Mrs Clinton believes that she can persuade the Members of this Parliament to do something which we would not accept from our own governments. From my point of view, it is fundamentally wrong for alleged terrorism investigators to have such extensive access to databases, because this undermines people’s self-determination over their own personal data. Personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used. In addition, the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end. It will not be possible to take legal action to discover the whereabouts of the data or to claim damages for its illegal use by third countries. This gives the state precedence over its citizens, who will all be reduced to the status of objects of suspicion. The Member States are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the EU. To give some examples in Germany, should Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees? Will it now become the norm for the German Government to buy from tax investigators data that has been obtained illegally? We find ourselves in a situation in which Parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision. Why should Google be able to set data thresholds in future? It is important to combat terrorism and, in particular, its causes, and I believe that we all agree on this, but not at the cost of fundamental rights. In this context, I have heard many speeches which refer to the EU as a community of values. We are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, in September 2009, I had to tell you that your political guidelines were continuing a failed Commission policy. Your neoliberal guidelines do not reveal a strategy for more social justice, nor do they provide better protection for Europe against crises. They provide no basis for the work to successfully combat poverty and social exclusion in Europe. Now you are presenting to us the College of Commissioners that best suits your programme. You can expect no applause for this from my group. Already during this new parliamentary term, this Parliament has demonstrated that it takes democratic control and codetermination seriously, and I very much welcome that. I am thinking of the new Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission and of the rejection of one of the candidate Commissioners, and I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will once again be conscientious in its addressing of the SWIFT agreement. Transparency and fairness are vital in the agreements between the institutions – only when we have these can we begin to talk about policy. It is about the people of Europe and the rest of the world, it is about good jobs and more rights to a good education and fair pay, it is about their right to peaceful development and an intact environment. Therefore, Mr Barroso, my group will not support your guidelines or your staffing proposal. Prepare yourself for our harsh, but fair, exchange of views with you and your College. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group also participated actively in the hearings of the candidates. Some of them made a thoroughly positive impression on us. We are less enthusiastic about the new arrangement of many of the portfolios. That also includes the rather mysterious – although perhaps soon to be less mysterious – area of responsibility of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is also Vice-President of the Commission. However, we found many of the candidates disappointing in terms of their specialist knowledge. In this regard, all of our questions related primarily to political projects. In what direction should the European integration process go? Which measures are most important to the Commission candidate? There were far too many vague answers to these questions and answers that, politically speaking, we do not support. Despite claims of a more social Europe, they persisted in advocating a route towards deregulation, privatisation or the flexicurity concept. The flexibility of workers was the top priority and social security was right at the bottom. Climate protection is on the agenda, but we are not seeing a move away from coal-powered generation of electricity or from nuclear power. I do not see the EU taking a leading role in climate protection and in development aid. Nothing has been said about consistent disarmament, especially with regard to nuclear weapons within Europe. Mr Barroso, Mr President, as much as I appreciate the candidates coming forward for the hearing, my group is unable to give your College a positive vote. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Svensson, will speak on the subject of the Swedish Presidency. I would like to highlight two points from the conclusions of the first summit following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, I regret the fact that the European Council did not communicate any clear messages with regard to the future strategy of the EU. On the contrary, it fell into line with the old Commission, which wanted to hold on to the basic principles of the failed Lisbon strategy. However, even though it has been acknowledged that a new political approach is needed, where is it? I have not seen it. With the new Commission, the new Parliament and the President of the European Council, however, there would now be a chance to start a totally new debate. Of course, there is the new treaty and the still to be implemented opportunity for the citizens initiative, too. Our starting point is clear: our priority, above all others, in particular, above the interests of profits, must remain the social and environmental concerns of the people. That needs to become the new basic principle of the European Union’s strategies and legislation, as only then will the citizens perceive the EU as representing progress in the long term. My second point is that we on the Left in the European Parliament welcome the fact that the Council is finally fulfilling the request for a capital transfer tax. In yesterday’s debate, we were pleased to hear Mr Barroso promise that the new Commission under his leadership would table the relevant proposals in the near future. We will continue to bring this subject up and we remain of the opinion that the European Union can and must take the first step in cases of doubt. Waiting for someone else at a global level to take this role away from us is not something we can continue to do. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, I have a question for you about the Tobin tax. This tax is a worthwhile proposal, but as yet, no one has introduced it. Everyone says that it will never be introduced unless all the Member States do so at the same time. I am now afraid, after the decision at the European summit, which I welcome, that this will once again be postponed, because we are not all starting at the same time. I would like to know what your opinion on this is and what you think are the chances of the Tobin tax being introduced. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.
 – (DE)
 Mr President, I would like to welcome the two candidates on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Above all, we welcome the fact that a woman has been elected. We assume that the two candidates for the high offices will not only focus on the content of their responsibilities, but will also develop a cooperative approach to Parliament. We expect the Council to deal more closely with the social issues resulting from the crisis and to draw the right conclusions. Billions have so far been paid to the bankers, but there has been virtually no help for the ordinary people. Mr Schulz is right when he says that the casino is open again, but at the same time, poverty and, in particular, child poverty is growing. Four million jobs were lost throughout Europe as a result of the crisis. According to reports from the Commission, this figure could increase to seven million over the course of the next year. We know that estimates of this kind are often lower than the real figures. For example, 1.5 million people in Germany are on short-time work and it is important to emphasise this. However, growing unemployment and poverty are the first signs of even greater inequality of opportunity which will have a major impact on educational opportunities. We also need to discuss this subject. The question that arises is whether the Heads of State or Government will find ways out of the crisis which combine the European concept of integration with social progress and which have a real impact for the citizens of Europe. Instead of exit strategies for the economic recovery programmes and mandatory budget consolidation, we need a change of policy. I have just three observations to make about this. Firstly, we expect the Council to give a statement on its position on the plans for the 2020 strategy, which is intended to replace the failed Lisbon Strategy. Innovation and knowledge, combating exclusion, green economic strategies, a digital Europe – as a list of slogans, this does not sound too bad. However, we urgently need concrete proposals describing how all of this will be implemented. Secondly, the Council must finally commit to a strict control system for the financial markets. I have a number of legitimate questions about how the Council can bring this into line with existing treaties, because in some cases, restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments are not permitted or wanted. We are interested to see how you will achieve this. Thirdly, I would like to emphasise once again that the Council must give a clear signal after Copenhagen that a binding climate change agreement is needed. Voluntary commitments have never achieved the desired objective. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 What I found pleasing about the special summit was that there was a gender balance. We would like to pay tribute to that achievement. I would also like to add that we will continue to support you if you continue to maintain this gender balance. We now have two new figureheads for the European Union to deal with, about whom all sides have said that they will have to grow into their roles. That, of course, will always be the case. There is also talk of lightweights and heavyweights. I see it like this: today’s lightweights are tomorrow’s heavyweights, and vice versa
. Many a heavyweight one day is a lightweight the next. That notwithstanding, we also have a severe economic crisis to overcome. The social consequences, especially, are giving us lots to deal with. In Europe, tens of millions of people are affected by unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. The number of crisis victims is going through the roof. In the developing world, the consequences are much worse. Are you prepared, Mr Barroso, together with the new Commission, to learn the lessons of the wrong turns taken through radical free-market policies? Are you prepared to bring about an urgently needed change of policy to put people ahead of profits and social interests ahead of competitive ones? Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by all 27 Member States. Many will be celebrating this as a great success, but my group will not be joining in these celebrations. I have stated the reasons for this many times in this House and I do not intend to do so again. Unfortunately, the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply for the citizens of three Member States gives me doubts about the EU’s great progress in the protection of fundamental rights. I mention this specifically in view of our celebratory sitting today and Václav Havel’s speech. However, precisely because the Left in Europe wants a social, peaceful and environmentally sustainable European integration, we will also continue to use the framework provided by the treaty for this purpose. We have done this up to now, and we will continue to do so. In this connection, I can only welcome the fact that the European Parliament will now have more rights. Amidst all the rejoicing, the Heads of State or Government would also have been well advised to use their recent summit for more tangible policies. The greatest challenge facing the world is climate change. In the run-up to the world climate conference in Copenhagen, the European Union has, unfortunately, lost the leading role that it had set itself. For one thing, the substance of the commitments to reduce CO2
 emissions does not correspond to what is actually needed. Moreover, it is unacceptable that the EU Member States quite clearly want to avoid their financial responsibilities, even though this is a situation where we cannot afford to delay our action. It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine-growing region – although I do not begrudge you that. It is quite simply about survival and, incidentally, also about peace in our world. Climate change is already causing poverty and hunger and forcing millions of people to flee from their homelands. Everyone in this Chamber has surely spoken at one time or another of global challenges that cannot be overcome at national level. Climate protection, peace and combating poverty are just such challenges. If the European Union does not act in a consistent and exemplary manner in this regard, it will lose its acceptance as an international player. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Mr Barroso, there has been much speculation over staffing issues during the last three months and over the possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which my group has rejected for three good reasons. In simplistic terms, firstly we want priority to be given to a social Europe rather than to a radical market orientation. Secondly, we want disarmament instead of the development of military capabilities and, thirdly, we want more direct democracy rather than a Europe made up of elites. We should at long last be dealing with specific issues of content. While we are arguing over names and positions, more and more people are losing their jobs. The banks have, of course, been rescued. At the same time, Mr Barroso is calling for us to bring an end to the economic recovery plans soon – yesterday the deadline was set for 2011 – and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be reduced quickly. This will mean reductions in salaries and pensions, cuts in public services and social security provision, higher value added tax and a lack of collective agreements. One current example of this can be found in the German commercial cleaning industry where workers have been on strike for three days. These are the problems which are affecting people in Europe and these are the problems which the Council should be dealing with. Instead of this, the main subject of concern is adding clauses to the Treaty of Lisbon to encourage the Czech President to sign it. If this is really as simple as it seems to be in practice, I would ask the Heads of Government to think more carefully about a social progress clause in the Treaty of Lisbon. That would be much more appropriate. At the beginning of the parliamentary term, a series of positive proposals were made concerning a more social EU policy. This did not just relate to the social progress clause. It was also about a new economic recovery plan for Europe in order to create and retain jobs and about increased investment and sustainable environmental growth. A European Employment Pact for more and better jobs, for equal pay, for more rights for employees and better working conditions was called for. There were discussions about increased solidarity among the Member States and ensuring the sustainability of the social security and pension systems. I have not yet identified any strategy within the policies of the Member States or the policies of the Commission which might lead us towards these objectives. Of course, the Council must now consider the appointments to the new Commission and the possible changes to the Treaty of Lisbon. However, the focus must be on the problems I have referred to and on their solutions. My group’s vote on the College of Commissioners will be dependent on this. Lothar Bisky,  
Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group

 Mr President, you are calling for us to leave behind the economic stimulus programmes soon and for the budget deficits in the Member States to be quickly reduced. Yet even your most recent forecast promises growth in EU GDP of just 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009 as a whole, that would represent a 4% decrease. According to your own forecasts, unemployment rates in the EU will rise to over 11% in 2010. Do you not think that early, drastic cuts in public expenditure could stop the small beginnings of recovery in their tracks? Or do you believe that the financial sector, for the moment, has got over the problem and the ordinary people should bear the costs of the crisis? Already, you are forcing scandalous conditions for EU emergency credit on the people of Latvia, Hungary and Romania: lower wages, lower pension benefits, fewer public services and higher VAT. Is that your idea of a social Europe? Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated mandatory referendums on the Reform Treaty throughout Europe. Voters in Ireland were the only ones with the opportunity to make their decision directly a year and a half ago. If we want the people to decide, then we must accept the result, even if we do not like it. The government in Ireland went against the principle of democracy and conducted a second referendum, partly as a result of pressure from other Member States. Now they have the result they wanted. We on the Left abide by the principle of democracy, but our concern over the political orientation of the EU remains. The number of ‘no’ votes in Ireland indicates that we are not the only ones with this concern. Our three main points of criticism are, firstly, that the previous policy of liberalising the financial markets, tax competition, decoupling of financial policy from economic policy and the dismantling of the social state contributed to the economic and financial crisis. As a result, this policy has led to an increase in poverty and inequality in Europe. Other than declarations of intent, very little has happened so far in terms of the regulation of the financial markets. On the contrary, while the unemployment figures are rising, the big banks are once again expecting large profits. The Treaty of Lisbon will continue this market economy policy with free competition. This is something that we cannot support. Instead, we call for a fundamentally different approach to tackling social challenges. Our aim is the introduction of a social progress clause with minimum wages applying throughout the EU – the same pay for the same work in the same place. We must combat wage dumping. Our second point of criticism is that the call for the Member States to gradually improve their military capabilities is incompatible with the aims of the Left, as is the entrenchment of a European armaments agency in primary European law. We will not support global military missions in order to assert our own interests. We do not want this kind of treaty; we want a treaty of disarmament rather than armament. It is paradoxical to be referred to as an opponent of Europe for this reason. Anyone in Europe who is in favour of armament is classed as a friend of Europe, but anyone in Europe who is in favour of disarmament is classed as an enemy of Europe. That is politically absurd! So, the referendum in Ireland has taken place and, even if it did not turn out exactly as we would have wanted, we on the Left will continue to work to achieve more direct democracy in Europe. Lothar Bisky,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you represent the continuity of a policy, Mr Barroso, which has contributed to the greatest economic crisis in post-war history. While the casinos in the major financial centres are reopening, the citizens of the world are footing the bill. The consequences of the crisis are unemployment, poverty, lower incomes and less education. You maintain that the financial crisis came primarily from the US and that it was only the bankers who caused the collapse. We say that the political system, including the policies of the EU Commission, was responsible for promoting casino capitalism. The ideology of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation has led to the crisis. Continuing as we have done in the past will result in an even more serious crisis. The political system must take responsibility, learn from its mistakes and give up its neo-liberal ideals. European policy must focus consistently on the interests of the people of Europe. I cannot identify a focus of this kind in your guidelines. However, I am pleased that in your remarks today, social issues were given greater importance than was the case a year ago. I would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples. You want to adhere to the Lisbon strategy. However, the people of Europe need good jobs at wages which will allow them to live with dignity. We need to put on the agenda a reduction and not an extension of working hours. We expect the new Commission to restructure the Posting of Workers Directive. Europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach. For this reason, we have proposed, together with some others, a legally binding clause on social progress and a charter of public services, which will give precedence to social security and services of general interest over internal market regulations. From what you have said, I understand that you do not think much of this. In the Zimmermann report, the European Parliament calls for a minimum wage of at least 60% of the average income in all Member States. You maintain that you can do nothing about this. I think that you could, for example, by means of the employment policy guidelines. You are focusing solely on the Stability and Growth Pact which has proved to be an ineffective tool, in particular, during the crisis. We want a social pact to replace the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact. You believe that a few new financial supervision regulations will keep the greed of the financial world in check. We are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements. You, and I quote, ‘support every paragraph of the Treaty of Lisbon’. We want a social Europe instead of a continuation of the radical focus on the internal market. We want a commitment to disarmament and civil conflict management instead of the continuing growth in military capability. You see Europe as a leading power and we want to spread the ideology of free trade and marketisation of all areas of life throughout the world. We stand for intercultural, multilateral dialogue and the greatest possible support for developing countries in overcoming the economic, food, financial and climate crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, let us elect a Commission together which sets itself the objective of a social, peaceful, economically sustainable and democratic European Union. If we want to gain acceptance among the people of Europe for the EU project, we need a break with radical free-market concepts and more direct democracy. In this case, Mr Barroso is the wrong man for the job of president. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has presented an ambitious work programme which includes a proposal for more transparency. Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing. Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy. The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis. They are innocent parties. Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis. I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers. Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism. We are keen to see what happens with the Baltic Sea Strategy and I would be behind the President-in-Office of the Council if he were to focus on dialogue with Russia. We would also like the European Union to support the pledges of President Obama and President Medvedev with regard to the dismantling of nuclear weapons. The European Union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament. The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers. Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy. This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars. Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place. The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures. We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries. We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment. I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets. Lothar Bisky,

 Mr President, I am pleased that a neighbour from Poland has become President of this House. I come from eastern Germany and work near Słubice. Słubice and Frankfurt/Oder are both part of a united Europe. I would like to thank you for focusing in particular on the continued integration of Eastern and Western Europe. There is still much to do in this respect, as we are all aware. However, I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe.

I once had the honour of presenting the Andrzej Wajda film prize to the director Andreas Dresen and of making a speech to mark the occasion.

 I rejected the report because it advocates a further militarisation of the EU and demands military autonomy via increased investment in armament, defence and military sectors despite the financial and economic crisis. It also calls for the expansion of military (training) operations and further strengthens EU-NATO cooperation. It encourages the use of development aid (European Development Fund) to finance security operations, supports and encourages further civil-military cooperation and advocates subordination of policy areas under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), and fosters the Military Industrial Complex (MIC). It supports and presses for the ATHENA mechanism and use of battle-groups. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject this report because the mutual defence clause (Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union) turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) paves the way for military interventions within the EU. The explicit ‘obligation’ to react ‘by all means’ in case of armed aggression against a Member State goes beyond NATO’s mutual assistance clause since non-armed attacks are also covered. Within the solidarity clause, military support is also demanded in case of terror attacks, natural or man-made disasters, which implies military operations within the EU. Cyber attacks, pandemics and energy shortages can also lead to activation of the solidarity clause. I voted against the report since there is no clear definition of what falls under the solidarity clause and whether social unrest/strikes are also considered ‘man-made disasters’. Furthermore, the report prefers military to civil measures outside and inside the EU, and focuses only on EU defence and military solutions. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 I reject the report because it advocates the militarisation of cyber security and regards the existing civil approach as inadequate, even though the risk is relatively low. It also calls for a deepening of cooperation with NATO and the use of the solidarity clause in the event of an ‘attack’ (in other words, military means will be used in cases of doubt).

 Although the report is based on the correct assumption that climate change can exacerbate existing conflicts, it wrongly focuses on repressive and military counter-measures whilst advocating further EU militarisation. I reject the report because it promotes systematic implementation of military elements into climate policy, financing from the EU budget of military measures linked to climate change, and further closer coordination and cooperation of EU and NATO as well as a special focus on development of military capabilities, pooling and sharing, including the merge of civil and military assets and capabilities. Current conflicts in developing countries can only be solved effectively, also with regard to climate change, if the underlying root causes of global distributive inequity are addressed; the military is the wrong solution.

Mr President, the EU has won the Nobel Peace Prize, and I would not wish to question its achievements, such as its role in reconciliation after the Second World War. However, the reports before us speak a different language. The mutual defence clause, in effect, turns the EU into a military alliance, and the solidarity clause includes the option of military intervention in Member States in response to man-made disasters. Let me ask the House this: would a Europe-wide general strike constitute such a man-made disaster? Will soldiers from Germany soon be deployed against striking workers in Greece? The implementation of the demands set out in the Annual Report on the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) would mean a quantum leap in the EU’s military development and an expansion of military intervention worldwide, probably with a robust mandate.  Much of this, including Member States’ obligation to develop their military capabilities, has to do with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. Let me say this: the Left in Europe did the right thing by rejecting this Treaty and we will continue their tireless efforts to bring about an amendment of these Treaty provisions. Sabine Lösing,

Madam President, over recent years, the international arms trade has grown further, and the countries of the European Union can once again claim a dubious success: at 34%, they have the leading share of the trade. Many of these exports go to countries with – and I word this carefully – a dubious human rights record, and into conflict areas. That is why there needs to be a complete ban on arms trading, especially in relation to conflict regions. The current negotiations at UN level on an Arms Trade Treaty represent a step in the right direction. We continue to hope that the treaty will not later turn out to be a paper tiger as toothless as previous agreements. For that reason, following a successful conclusion of the treaty, implementation needs to remain on the political agenda consistently. The constructive, cross-group cooperation on the current resolution is a good sign, and one that I am pleased about. It is therefore all the more disappointing that we were unable to avoid the positive reference to the arms industry in paragraph 2 of the resolution. Aside from the moral aspects, I would like to point out that studies have concluded beyond doubt that the influence of military expenditure on jobs is very low in comparison with other public spending. Rather than jobs, it is mostly about ensuring the profits of this branch of industry, the more so given that disarmament and conversion could promote sustainable development, growth and jobs.

 Mr President, ‘yet another war over oil’: that could be the heading for an intervention on the current conflict in Sudan. Once again, the civilian population of both countries are enduring indescribable suffering. All violent attacks and assaults are naturally to be condemned, and naturally we must call for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, that does not absolve us from talking about the causes, or from looking back critically at whether the EU’s clear commitment to the splitting off of South Sudan was responsible given the current circumstances. There will be no quick solution; that much is certain. It is also certain, however, that the problems cannot be resolved by means of armed conflict. Right now, it is essential that we maintain the arms embargo that in fact exists, in order to prevent further escalations. I would like to remind you that in 2004, the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) imposed an embargo on arms supplies to Sudan and, in 2011, also to South Sudan, but this was unilaterally relaxed in November 2011 to support security sector reform in South Sudan. However difficult it may be, we need to push for diplomatic negotiations. If the international community wants to help end the conflict, it must do so in the role of a neutral mediator, not led by its own interests. The role that the EU has played has not been neutral. I am very concerned as to whether there will be more such scenarios in future, whether we will see more natural resource-rich regions of Africa splitting off and a spiralling of state disintegration. The foreign policy instrument of state building must not be allowed to be an instrument of such a development. Using access to reserves of natural resources to guide us in our foreign policy activities will bring not peace, but rather death and misery. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, nuclear weapons are among the vilest weapons there are and they should be abolished worldwide. Civil use of nuclear energy is impossible to control. We therefore need to do everything we can to ensure that there is a worldwide move away from nuclear power and towards global nuclear disarmament, and specifically in this case towards a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East – and we must do so in a peaceful way. Until then, the current treaties will apply. As worthy of criticism as the regime in Iran is, it should be noted that, unlike India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It therefore exercises the right to the civil use of nuclear energy guaranteed to all states that have signed this Treaty. That is dangerous – just as it is dangerous in other countries. No one thinks – quite rightly – of taking military action against all the states that have nuclear power plants, or penalising them with sanctions. Neither the secret services nor the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency provide solid evidence that Iran is building, preparing or planning nuclear weapons. Yet blatant threats of war have been made against Iran for many years on precisely this pretext. In addition, there is an increasingly aggressive economic war being waged with the intention of destabilising the country. This policy, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious danger to world peace and limits the opportunities for progressive opposition in Iran. As is so often the case, it seems very much as though peace and human rights are to fall victim to the global interests of the United States and the EU.

 Mr President, today’s discussion takes place against the background of the economic and financial crisis which has deprived many people of their livelihood, their rights and their democracy, and against the background of the thousands of people, in particular children, who are dying of hunger throughout the world. If we are to make savings in Europe, then we should cut our defence spending. Defence means defence against territorial attacks, so it is good that we can say: Yes, we can make savings in this area. However, even if I were to accept the prevailing logic and to assume that our defence requirements are at a very high level, it seems to me that the aim here is to reach a higher level of military capability under the guise of pressure on costs and to give the defence industry a better and more reliable source of income. I think that the scenario of a defence capability under threat is being exaggerated. I would like to mention here that it is not true that cuts in defence spending will lead to a rise in unemployment. That is simply not the case. However, high levels of defence spending do not only involve huge sums of money which are needed elsewhere. The proposals in Mr Lisek’s report also mean putting democracy at risk, for example, by means of the ATHENA mechanism, which is not subject to democratic controls, or by combining civilian and military capabilities. We will be voting against this report. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, have tabled a minority opinion, which calls, among other things, for radical disarmament and a purely civilian EU.

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I welcome the excellent cross-party cooperation and majority support for the joint resolution on banning cluster munitions. The resolution constitutes an important and strong signal in the fight against these deadly weapons. We must not forget that cluster munitions and bombs were used in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, and – I would like to remind this Parliament – also by EU Member States. There is no justification for continuing to use these weapons or to store or produce them – none whatsoever – not for defence and not for protecting borders. I urgently call on all Member States not to support the proposed draft text of the new Protocol VI to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects. This draft would entail a dramatic step backwards. This draft text prohibits – and this cannot be said clearly enough – cluster munitions and bombs made prior to 1980. That would mean that cluster munitions produced after this date would continue to be permitted and could also continue to be used in future. That is something that we must not accept. The Convention on Cluster Munitions that entered into force in August 2010 prohibits all cluster bombs and munitions, and that must be the benchmark.

− Sexual crimes against children constitute one of the most abhorrent crimes, and we must do our utmost to prevent them from taking place. This report provides tools to do just that, and I welcome many of the new provisions. The main reason why I could not support this report is because it also introduces provisions which allow for access to certain Internet web sites to be blocked. I wholeheartedly agree that the mass dissemination of images of abuse through the Internet must be stopped; however, this can only be achieved through the removal at source of such material. However, if we want to allow blocking as a complementary measure, we must ensure that the conditions and safeguards for blocking are stringent and in conformity with our fundamental rights. This is particularly important as such provisions are being introduced in EU legislation for the very first time, and therefore set a precedent. However, the current provisions fall short of these standards because they are not stringent enough and may, therefore, pave the way for restricting internet users on a wider scale, thus leading to the censorship of the Internet on the basis of intellectual property rights breaches or other minor offences.

 I voted against this report as I reject the notion that, if in doubt, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief should be tackled from within the framework of the common security and defence policy (CSDP). What is more, there must not be any mixing of civilian and military activities, something that this report would make possible. I furthermore strongly reject the introduction of security policy elements into the areas of civil protection and humanitarian assistance on the strength of any purported threat of terrorism. I advocate civilian disaster relief independent of security policy concerns and argue for the build-up of the necessary logistical capabilities, which must be independent of the military. Moreover, I would point out that the report refers to the solidarity clause in a positive light, a clause which, for example, also makes military intervention against striking workers possible.

 Mr President, in Israel, too, thousands are demonstrating for social justice and democracy and indicating the connection between their desperate social situation, settlement policy and the huge military expenditure. The policies of those in power in Israel are directed against the Palestinians and also against their own people. The establishment of peace in the region is therefore in the interests of the people of both Israel and Palestine and of world peace – and urgently so. Anyone who does not support the inclusion of Palestine in the United Nations is not doing what is necessary for the security of the people in Israel and Palestine. All forces in Europe must work to obtain a two-state solution, and political decisions must be taken. The recognition of Palestine’s diplomatic representations as embassies in all European States would improve the status of Palestine under international law. All European States must insist that the settlements, which contravene international law, be stopped. Only the equality of the Israeli and the Palestinian people can bring peace and social justice for everyone and marginalise radical forces. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, there is no other policy area where the European Parliament has so few rights of codecision as in the fields of foreign and, especially, of military policy. When it comes to EU military operations, it is the Heads of State or Government alone, meeting in the European Council, who make the decisions. When it comes to the key issue of war and peace, then, the European Parliament has absolutely no right to be heard or even to oversee. There is not even a binding rule that Parliament must be informed before the Union launches a foreign intervention. In light of the establishment of the European External Action Service, which, in practice, has become the executive arm of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), and of the start-up fund for military operations, which has a firm basis in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is a need for more monitoring powers for the national parliaments and for the European Parliament, and for these powers to actually be effective. The resolution on the table does state that the cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament needs to be improved, but there is a definite lack of specific proposals as to how that can be done. The interparliamentary assembly that we have proposed – to be composed of representatives from both national and European level – could pave the way for the resolution or at least attenuation of glaring democratic deficits. Such an interparliamentary assembly need not be composed of all the parties represented in the parliaments in order to ensure real and democratic supervision of European foreign and security policy. It would be nice if our amendments enacting this were to be approved tomorrow. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, in February, many people, including in this House, were full of both hope and concern about the future of Sudan. There were differing views on the continuing risk of violent clashes. It was clear that the people of Sudan faced major problems and need support. Now, the situation in Sudan is making the headlines again. The cause of the most recent events is the unresolved issues linked to the forthcoming independence of the South, and these problems cannot be resolved through guns. I therefore welcome the recent agreement between the North and South Sudan, brokered by the African Union, on a demilitarised zone along the future border between the two states. A 7 000 strong UN force modelled on MONUC could cause more harm than good, however. If we just look at the Congo, we can see what MONUC troops can get up to. Aid for Sudan must be impartial and not tied to any one interest group. It must put the interests of the people of the South and of the North at its heart, and this applies to both material and diplomatic aid. In order to prevent further fuelling of the conflict, all supplying of weapons must be halted. We are calling for an end to all civil/military collaboration and to the military training mission.

 Mr President, in a deeply divided country like Côte d’Ivoire, can a lasting peace be brought about by violent means and can the winner of the presidential election be legitimised? This seems extremely doubtful, especially as the real causes of the conflict have not been resolved. The country was destabilised as a result of economic problems brought about largely by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank. The sanctions which were rapidly imposed with the aim of weakening the Gbagbo government have exacerbated the situation and given rise to a humanitarian crisis in Côte d’Ivoire. The legitimacy of both claimants to the presidency is in dispute. The armies of both sides are responsible for massacring the civilian population. Once again, the West has taken sides and now the United Nations (UN) is waging war alongside French troops to try to ensure the victory of one side in the conflict. Will European powers once again be deciding the fate of African people as they did in colonial times, but this time with the support of the UN? What has happened to the principles of international law? Is this the concept on which the UN was founded? Instead of aiming for peaceful solutions to conflicts, the UN seems to be supporting civil wars or taking sides in them. Whose interest is this in? Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, the Belder report has been considerably improved by the amendments, and my group can agree with a great number of statements. Unfortunately, for all that they are correct, it primarily contains descriptions of the situation, but the underlying philosophy of a realistic future perspective has not been developed. The human rights situation in Iran is intolerable. However, sanctions will not bring about a lasting improvement in this situation. In order to promote democratisation in Iran, we must do everything we can to make the international situation less tense. Worsening international relations brings with it the danger that further anti-democratic measures will be taken inside Iran, which will result in weakening the opposition. A policy of detente would also have to put an end to every form of threatening behaviour. Negotiations and international relations can only be successful if diplomatic recognition of all partners is a given. Only in this way can meaningful compromises in the dispute on the nuclear programme be achieved. I have set out our ideas for a carefully targeted Iran strategy in an alternative motion for a resolution, and on the grounds that I have described, I shall call for the Belder report to be rejected.

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, will the situation now improve for the people in Southern Sudan or is the split more in the interests of the West so that we can get control of the oil reserves? In any case, the South has huge challenges ahead. Without a functional infrastructure and with the current disastrous economic situation, civilian assistance and humanitarian aid will be needed for a long time. Unfortunately, the danger of violent conflicts has probably not been eliminated for certain. However, experts believe that this cannot be resolved by military means. On the contrary, a focus on military means prevents a real solution to the conflicts being found. The necessary civilian assistance can be provided much more efficiently without military involvement. The transfer of civilian tasks to the military hinders the sustainable development of civilian structures. An example of this is Darfur. A massive military apparatus has now taken over the tasks of humanitarian and development organisations there, something that has been sharply criticised by these organisations. Our demands are that the focus be on purely civilian conflict management and assistance measures, in other words a reduction of the UN mission to the civilian components and no potential use of EU battle groups. In addition, in terms of a development perspective we call for Sudan’s debt be written off. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, many thanks to Mr Gahler for his report. It is clear, also from this report, that there is enormous interest in the natural resources of the Arctic region. As a result of climate change, oil and gas and other resources can be extracted increasingly easily. The issue of making better use of shipping routes has already been discussed. The logical consequence of this is that pollution will increase in the region. Industrial development – in particular, through the extraction of oil and gas, the expansion of commercial fishing and increased shipping traffic – will all necessarily lead to the disturbance, or perhaps even destruction, of this highly sensitive ecosystem, with devastating consequences. Unfortunately, this report deals in generalities and does not contain any effective strategies for combating these dangers. A point that is not mentioned is the fact that the EU is not alone in recognising the increased geostrategic significance of the Arctic. The bordering states of Russia and NATO members USA, Canada, Denmark and Norway have already begun militarising the Arctic region and intend to protect their interests there. Climate change has led to this situation in the Arctic. We need to prevent the catastrophic progress of this change, something that can only be achieved through a rapid changeover to renewable energy sources. However, this strategy takes a diametrically opposite approach. We, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot. In common with numerous environmental organisations, we are calling for a moratorium on new oil extraction projects in the Arctic. A treaty needs to be agreed – similar to the Treaty on the Antarctic – that prohibits the extraction of mineral resources in the region. Last but not least, we are calling for the immediate demilitarisation of the region and therefore for the establishment of the Arctic as a demilitarised zone. Because my group and I are unable to support the results of the own-initiative report presented here, the GUE/NGL has submitted an alternative report.

 Mr President, I am not in favour of that and, of course, it is not possible to impose this from above. The question remains, however: Who was consulted? Which states are involved? Which indigenous peoples are affected? Was there any consultation with the people who may benefit from the situation, or with those who may lose their livelihood? I think that further dialogue is needed. The talks held so far are not enough. We need to try to keep this dialogue as broad as possible, also consulting with wider sections of society, possibly including the indigenous peoples in particular. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, what is this all about? Is it about organised crime or about political and/or religious terrorism? This is an important question when it comes to assessing the situation. Experts on this region are of the opinion that this is more to do with crime than with religiously motivated international terrorism. Measures against terrorism often have fatal consequences for peace and democracy and can be used as a pretext for promoting other interests. It may be that this is also about Africa as one of the areas in which Europe is interested. In the words of Gilles de Kerchove, the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, it concerns Africa as Europe’s backyard. I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa. The Sahel region can only be made secure by improving the situation of the population. Increasing security and military budgets in countries where the population is suffering from an acute food shortage is a disastrous move. Finally, I would like you to consider the fact that kidnapping and other crimes are a business in which many people are involved in a confusing array of organisations. Western funding for security structures could have a counterproductive effect on efforts to combat crime and could continue putting innocent people at risk in future.

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, women and children continue to be disproportionately hard hit by wars and their consequences. However, women’s rights must not be misused in order to give legitimacy to military interventions. The example of the Republic of Congo shows that military measures do not help to protect, secure or establish women’s rights. Unfortunately, exactly the opposite is true. The situation of women in Afghanistan today is worse than ever as a result of the war. The promise made in resolution 1325 can only really be honoured by avoiding conflict and taking only civil measures in war and conflict situations. Therefore, I believe that it is completely unacceptable to distort this resolution with the aim of increasing the number of women involved in warfare. I am calling for the EU to stop providing support on principle, including aid for equipment and training, to regimes and military forces which send child soldiers into armed conflicts, violate human rights or commit systematic acts of sexual violence.

 Mr President, it is important to make clear at this point that, when it comes to the EU’s foreign policy financing instruments, the Treaty of Lisbon abolished the European Parliament’s right of supervision. In so doing, the competency for these financing instruments was fully transferred to the Commission and to the High Representative, and with her, to the European External Action Service. I find it completely unacceptable that Parliament and the Council are to be ignored, despite the fact that what is at issue is the European Union’s far-reaching foreign policy measures and their implementation. We support Parliament’s cross-group efforts aiming to re-establish parliamentary supervision of the financing instruments. Accordingly, we will support the amendments to the delegated acts in this regard, which, of course, were discussed earlier. All the same, I would like to close by expressing my major concern in respect, in particular, of the Instrument for Stability and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as I believe that these instruments are used in an undemocratic and non-transparent way and, in some cases, against the will of the countries in question, which gives them the character of an interventionist EU foreign policy.

 I condemn the mass rapes and serious violations of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the strongest possible terms. I very much welcome the inclusion and adoption of this condemnation in the joint motion for a resolution. I voted against the joint motion for a resolution, however, because, to a large extent, Congolese military and police units trained by the EU’s EUPOL and EUSEC missions since 2005 were, and are, also involved in these crimes. The joint motion for a resolution expressly supports and welcomes these training missions. I am in favour of the immediate cessation of these missions, as they have contributed in a negative way to the escalation of violence and to the situation in the country by training security forces that have been repeatedly involved in the serious violations of the human rights of the Congolese people. In addition, the army and police trained by the EU support the repressive apparatus of the corrupt Kabila regime. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in 2000, the European Union clearly stated in the Lisbon strategy its objective of becoming the leading economic power in the world by 2010. We have failed to meet this target in many areas, but not as far as arms exports from the EU are concerned. In the period from 2005 to 2009, the EU Member States overtook the United States and became the world’s leading arms exporters. I think that this development is highly questionable. Obviously, the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was never legally binding and which included a restrictive export licensing practice, consisted of empty words. Therefore, I very much welcome the fact that the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was converted into a common position in December 2008. However, we still have no effective sanction mechanisms. For example, long before 2008, Germany recognised the Code of Conduct as being legally binding. Despite this, Germany is now the third largest arms exporter in the world and supplies arms to crisis regions such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. In addition, the arms export reports which the Member States submit to the Council are not uniform and often not transparent. We urgently need standardisation in this area, so that all the relevant arms exports are traceable and can be subjected to critical evaluation. Unfortunately, almost no efforts are being made to standardise these reports. In any case, I doubt whether it is possible to have a system of ethically sound arms exports. However, one thing is certain and that is that the European Union is currently a very long way from achieving this.

Madam President, I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions, which I expressly support. As already explained, cluster munitions are indeed among the most brutal weapons in existence. They were certainly still in use by some EU Member States and the USA until recently. I could mention the former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. It is quite shocking that – as has already been stated – statistically, the victims of cluster bombs and cluster munitions are 98% civilians, 27% of whom are children. How are we to view the prospects for the continued use of these weapons? It is certainly remarkable that Deutsche Bank is investing in the production of these dreadful weapons through its subsidiaries. It has been proven that business relations exist between Deutsche Bank and leading suppliers and manufacturers of cluster munitions, including L-3 Communications and Lockheed Martin. I find it shameless and inhumane to knowingly seek to make money from the death of civilians. The use, production, storage and transport of these weapons must be prohibited; the same goes for the trade in such weapons. For this reason, all EU Member States, along with all other countries, must sign and ratify the agreement on cluster munitions in full by August of this year or, if this is not possible, as Mr Gahler has stated, they must do so at the earliest possible opportunity. There should also be a moratorium on the use, production and distribution of cluster munitions until the agreement is ratified and work should begin as quickly as possible to destroy the existing stockpiles of cluster munitions. I am very pleased with this cross-party cooperation and support for the agreement on cluster munitions in the form of this joint resolution and welcome it on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. We believe that this resolution represents a major success in the fight against these murderous weapons. Cornelia Ernst and Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– Bearing in mind that Frontex was, inter alia, set up to ‘protect’ the EU’s borders from so-called ‘illegal’ migrants, we oppose the agency and its objectives. However, we welcome the guidelines for an adequate consideration of international and European asylum and human rights law within the Commission’s proposal (COM (2009)0658 final). We especially welcome point 1 of Annex I (respect of the principle of non-refoulement, the consideration of the special needs of vulnerable persons and those who are in need of urgent medical assistance, training for border guards in human rights and refugee law) as well as points 3 and 4 (including consideration of the migrant’s situation, taking into account their possible requests for assistance or the seaworthiness of the ship, no disembarkation in countries where persons risk being persecuted and tortured) mentioned in Annex II. In addition to this, we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of Frontex according to these principles. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to make clear at this point that we are deeply concerned about the development of EU foreign policy towards militarisation and an increasingly interventionist policy. That is a dangerous development. I want to say, in all clarity, that we believe that a military approach to conflict resolution or to the supposed stabilisation of countries or regions is absolutely the wrong way to go to achieve greater security for the EU and the world. Military interventions – and Afghanistan, unfortunately, is a very current example of this – bring suffering, death and prolonged devastation, but no peace and no improvement in the situation as far as the resident population is concerned. The Danjean report lists what are referred to as key threats that constitute a challenge for the EU’s future security policy. One of these is climate change – something that has been overwhelmingly caused by the industrialised nations of the West. If people in the countries of the South have to take flight because they no longer have any water and food becomes scarcer and scarcer, they will represent a security problem for Europe. Such a view is cynical and inhuman. If States collapse as a result of neoliberal economic policy, they will constitute a security problem. What we need is not more military, it is a change, an end to the European Union’s neoliberal orientation. The European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the creation of a crisis management and planning directorate and the planned start-up fund to fund military operations are designed to make the EU a global player in military terms. We believe that moves towards centralisation in the European External Action Service are a dangerous and undemocratic development. The EU should assume a leading role in relation to demilitarisation and disarmament, especially in the field of nuclear disarmament. There needs to be a push for the obligation incumbent upon nuclear States under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which is to say, complete nuclear disarmament, to be honoured at long last. This was a key promise that constituted the basis on which many States signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and have, as a result, durably refrained from acquiring nuclear weapons. Reliable guarantees of non-aggression are the best means of preventing proliferation as, otherwise, countries threatened with intervention will attempt to deter such an attack by means of acquiring nuclear weapons. If nothing else, I would like, in this context, and in particular with regard to Iran, to point out and to warn that military operations or military activities of any kind to prevent proliferation are completely counter-productive and highly dangerous. We will be rejecting the Danjean report and have tabled our own resolution on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL
),  
in writing. 
– I am fully aware that international nuclear disarmament, and therefore the strengthening of the NPT and its ratification by all states, are of vital importance and that every effort should be made to implement the treaty in all its aspects. To ensure effective multilateral efforts, they must be set within a well-developed vision of achieving a nuclear weapon-free world at the earliest date possible. We must insist on the commitment of the nuclear weapons states under Article VI of the NPT to disarm completely, as it was a key promise and so many countries have signed the NPT and thus forego nuclear weapons permanently. We oppose the phrase in this joint resolution (Recital G): ‘... making use of all instruments at its disposal to prevent ...’. I warn, in particular regarding Iran, that any military activity to prevent proliferation is completely counterproductive and highly dangerous. I am convinced that the best way to deal with the problem of proliferation would be to abandon atomic energy once and for all, as its civilian use bears great dangers on its own and, moreover, it cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty that civilian nuclear technology will not be used for military purposes.

 Mr President, we believe that the item on Madagascar is not particularly important today. We would therefore ask that that time slot be used to discuss the case of Mr Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Afro-American journalist who was found guilty of murdering a policeman in 1982, following a trial based on circumstantial evidence. Mumia Abu-Jamal has been sentenced to death and has been waiting on death row for 30 years. Up until now, no satisfactory explanation has been found for the events surrounding this murder and the evidence has never really been properly investigated. In any case, the death sentence is one of the clearest violations of human rights we know. Although, in this trial, the death sentence could have been commuted to lifelong imprisonment, the prosecution rejected this possibility at the end of January. The life of Mr Abu-Jamal is now more at risk than ever. We would like this matter to be debated in plenary so that we can decide what action to take in order to ensure that his death sentence is suspended and that Mumia Abu-Jamal is given the opportunity to prove his innocence in a fair trial.

Madam President, the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror. At this point in time, however, the strategic options for the US and the Member States of the EU in Yemen and the Horn of Africa region are not really open. The fact is that the ruling elites surrounding President Saleh brutally discriminate against and suppress the Shi’ite population in the north of the country and are waging a war against the separatist movement in the south, in the area of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, that is causing a great deal of suffering to the population there. There is no real provable connection to speak of between the Shi’ite population and al-Qaeda and this idea thus merely serves the corrupt and de facto
 autocratic government as a smoke-screen behind which to obtain massive military aid. Supporting this government to build up security forces should be avoided – doing so merely pours further oil on the fire. Any aid provided must benefit all the regions, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political orientation. A reconciliation process including the UN and all local players, including in the neighbouring states – such as Iran – must be initiated and promoted. We must not provide one-sided support of the government against the rebels. Operation Atalanta should not be continued and expanded, and absolutely not onto the territory of the Yemeni mainland, because this would only serve the geostrategic interests of Western industrialised nations. We should focus all our efforts on ensuring that the EU does not go along with the US’s completely erroneous strategy of escalation in Yemen, too. Sabine Lösing,

 Mr President, in no other country in the world have there, as yet, been more European Security and Defence Policy operations than in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As always, the question arises of whose security is being defended. Is it the security of the Congolese civilian population, the women and children? The UN mission MONUC did not prevent thousands of people being killed, tortured and raped and hundreds of thousands of people being expelled – atrocities in which the government forces supported by the EU were involved. So what is being defended in the Congo? Humanity? Or are we safeguarding a regime that, between 2003 and 2006, for example, concluded 61 contracts with international mining firms, not a single one of which was judged by international NGOs to be acceptable from the point of view of the Congolese people? President Kabila changed course for a while and concluded fewer contracts with Western firms. This change was suspended when the war escalated once again. My question is, why are the people who pull the strings of the largest group behind the murders in eastern Congo – the FDLR – reputed to be in Germany? I am referring here to the resolution that I have tabled on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

– On 9 November 2009, the report on the request for the defence of the immunity and privileges of Tobias Pflüger (A7-0054/2009
) was voted and adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) in the European Parliament. This report is based on incorrect facts. The central point is that the report cites a judgment at first instance which has been repealed. The judgment is invalid, because the regional court in Munich http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=dismiss" ed http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=an" http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;p=5tY9AA&amp;search=action"  against Tobias Pflüger on 21 July 2009 in the second and final instance. A conviction was not made. For this reason, all reproaches are invalid. It is politically unacceptable that this report, which contains incorrect facts, was voted in Plenary today (24 November 2009). We have tried to get this incomplete and therefore incorrect report taken from the agenda, unfortunately without success. This kind of proceeding by the European Parliament creates the impression of supporting the persecution of politically active persons, in this case, the Munich II Public Prosecution Service against a former Member of the European Parliament.

Madam President, thank you for the report. As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I questioned the competent representative of the Commission in a debate on the role of this agreement within the framework of EU immigration management. He clearly stated that, when it entered into force, it would pave the way for cooperation with the border security agency (Frontex) and for numerous immigration regulations, such as within the framework of readmission agreements and border security with Afghanistan. The 1 200 km long border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has already been addressed here. It will then also become another target of the EU’s repressive policy to keep out refugees. Thus, the European Union wants to seal itself off from refugees far beyond its external borders. Yet again, we see that this is a fundamental component of EU foreign policy. As a result of such partnership agreements, refugees are interned in camps, in which, as we all know, inhumane conditions prevail, as is currently the case in Ukraine. The problem has already been addressed here in general terms. This form of so-called international immigration management involves serious infringement of the Geneva Refugee Convention and of international human rights. I therefore call on the EU to start fighting the cause of flight rather than the refugees. The European neighbourhood policy is one means of making fortress Europe even more impenetrable, which is why it is looked on very sceptically from our point of view, from the point of view of the GUE/NGL. Sabine Lösing  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, I think that this conflict is very often presented in a very one-sided manner. I agree with the previous speaker that in the present case it is frequently a matter of attacks on Han Chinese by Uighurs and indeed that some of these attacks are racially motivated. (Heckling)
 I read an interview with a Uighur woman, for example, who said: Would you like to be governed by yellow communists? The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region, for example they are allowed to have more children, they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples. Many of the local Han Chinese are also envious of them. We ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects. Sometimes problems do not lie where they seem to at first glance. We should be careful not to take a one-sided position. We ought to support the Chinese in solving their problems. The one-sided view that is so often presented in this House is, in my opinion, dangerous. The Chinese Government certainly has shortcomings in its policy towards minority groups and it has its failures too. However, it is also showing the will to improve in many areas. We should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation – and indeed also critical cooperation – based on trust. Sabine Wils,

Mr President, the most recent climate conferences have not produced any substantive improvements. The survival of the small island states and the least developed countries is still at risk from climate change. In Doha, the Green Climate Fund agreed in 2010 must be established, and a decision is also needed on the Kyoto Protocol, which expires at the end of 2012.  According to the World Bank, the global South needs USD 100 billion annually from 2014 to support adaptation to the impacts of climate change. It is clear that the industrialised countries must take responsibility for providing this funding. As long as the industrialised and emerging countries are at odds with each other and deploy blockading tactics, Doha will not produce any positive outcomes for the global climate. Climate protection must start at the national level and, in our case, at the European level as well.  The EU must increase its greenhouse reduction target for 2020 to 40 % against the 1990 baseline and make a firm and binding commitment to increase the share of renewables to 45 % by 2030.

Mr President, since it became clear that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy would each be preparing an own-initiative report, Parliament has been overrun by industry lobbyists. A whole string of shale gas events has been held since then here in this House, month after month, by the gas production companies – and with the active support of both conservative and liberal Members. There was only a single event here that was not organised by the disciples of fracking among us. This dominance of one-sided lobbying by financially powerful corporations should give us food for thought. It is unacceptable.  This perversion is particularly apparent when it comes to the subject of fracking. Companies want to protect their income; risks are played down and swept aside. Accidents are ruled out. Apparently we need shale gas for the energy transition. We are told the impact on the landscape will also be minimal, and so on. No, all this cannot hide the fact that fracking involves incalculable risks, is superfluous and only serves the profit interests of a small number of gas monopolists. I therefore ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 4, in which the Member States are called upon not to approve any more fracking activities.

Mr President, I believe these lobbyists are holding this event to influence us MEPs. This event outside Parliament today, before tomorrow’s vote, is particularly blatant. I think that most people will also be unable to escape the arguments being made there, as they are supposedly objective arguments. Nevertheless, I do not wish to imply that of anyone. I find it striking, however, that the industry thinks it can make an impression here with its arguments. Yet certain statements that we are hearing are actually influenced by them. That is why I do not think it a good thing that we are allowed to be overrun by lobbyists in such a way here in Parliament. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Mr President, Mr Krahmer, to my mind an open debate involves a podium discussion to which both sides are invited, where opponents and advocates of fracking are both given the opportunity to speak. The majority of events that have been held here in Parliament, however, were not of this nature. As I said, just one event against fracking was held, involving a non-governmental organisation from the United States. (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8)).

Mr President, I do not think an exhibition can influence your opinion, any more than a conversation with a non-governmental organisation can change my opinion. Nevertheless, I do not consider it right that it is possible now, before this vote takes place in Parliament, for these lobbyists to be there right outside our door and go ahead with this event, which has already been touched upon several times here.

 Mr President, it is time to put an end once and for all to the fact that, every year, tens of thousands of people in the EU die prematurely because of marine emissions. Outside the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), ships’ engines are more or less burning special waste. On this, the EU is lagging far behind the US and Canada, where only low sulphur fuel can be used in coastal areas. As far as I am concerned, this proposal to amend the directive represents a clear improvement, and this is partly down to the tenacity of the rapporteur. Better limit values are only half the battle, however. Equally as important is the fact that these are then implemented and enforced. There are certain loopholes, as a result of which it cannot be ruled out that shipowners will be able to evade the directive if, for example, a shipowner apparently proves that he is unable to store low sulphur fuels. It really comes down to the Member States and the Commission here. They must implement the regulations and impose painful penalties when necessary. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, in relation to the recast version of the first railway package, all the groups except my own appear to believe that more competition in the railway sector could be beneficial to citizens. In fact, the very opposite is the case. Or is all this perhaps really about securing profits for those private companies involved in the railway sector and bringing about a quick break-up and privatisation of what have, up to now, been national railways such as SNCF and Deutsche Bahn
? Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom, for example, shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy of liberalisation will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. The railway sector should not lose its economic, social and environmental role for the future, and therefore must not be broken up into individual free-market radical, profit-focused parts. My group is therefore on the side of the trade unions and clearly in favour of the idea of retaining integrated railway companies, which have crucial experience and skills, in public hands. These companies not only provide social security for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased volumes of rail traffic in future. In the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the majority from the other groups essentially followed the Commission proposal for a further liberalisation and privatisation of the railway sector. It remains unclear what competences the national rail supervisory authorities and the new EU regulatory body would each have in relation to safety matters. In any case, the safety of rail traffic must be prioritised above the supervision of competition rules. In Parliament’s negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the idea was always in the background that the fourth railway package would also herald the separation of networks and operators. This, too, is something that my group will resolutely oppose. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the fundamental tenor of the Commission’s proposal and of the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in relation to the Energy Taxation Directive would facilitate the uniform handling of all sources of energy by 2023 by following a technically neutral approach with a minimum tax rate for all traded fuels and electricity, based on CO2
 and energy content. At the same time, incentives would be established for the use of less polluting energy products for the transition to a low carbon economy. The proposed directive would provide three important tax incentives: firstly, for the reduction of CO2
 emissions, secondly, for the saving of energy, and thirdly, for the promotion of a changeover to more energy-efficient fuels and more environmentally sound energy production. The adjustment for diesel fuel to bring it into line with the taxation of petrol could place pressure on the motor industry to develop more energy-efficient engines. In the United Kingdom, both fuels are already taxed to the same level. The EU’s objective of minimum taxation establishes equal conditions for all. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the current vote on the Roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050 is of central importance. The lack of ambition in relation to European climate protection policy threatens the sustainable development of Europe’s economy. Dirty technologies, such as nuclear power and carbon capture and storage, are impeding a change in energy policy. The EU emissions trading system has so far failed as an instrument for climate protection and is undermining European climate protection policy. It shows that market-based instruments are not the way to combat climate change. Long-term climate protection means identifying binding targets for renewable energies and for the reduction of greenhouse gases. Binding interim steps for 2030 and 2040 as part of the move away from the use of carbon in economic activity by 2050 will give industry some certainty in relation to planning. Ambitious climate protection with a long-term goal of 95% greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 in comparison with 1990 levels will promote innovation and create new jobs in the area of renewable technologies.

 Mr President, the Member States and the industrialised nations have been living beyond their means for many years. It is nothing new when I tell you that we can only enjoy a lifestyle like this at the expense of the poorer countries of the world. The WEEE Directive addresses at least part of the problem. The open area of application is of decisive importance. This approach can and should set an example in terms of environmental legislation. I am pleased that a collection target of 85% has been set, particularly because the Council held out stubbornly for lower targets for a long time. I constantly find myself saying: Parliament needs to flex its muscles. After all, people will only invest in environmentally-friendly technologies and innovation will only be encouraged if legislators speed up their work. With this in mind, I also welcome the fact that solar modules are not to be excluded from the directive. It was right not to rely on a voluntary, self-imposed commitment by the manufacturers. All too often in the past, Parliament has bowed to pressure and given in to such deals. These deals have also often proven to be just another way for the industry to drag its heels. Nonetheless, I do not agree with the way the directive deals with nanomaterials. It is essential that waste equipment containing nanomaterials should be dealt with separately. The report simply invites the Commission to investigate whether this is to continue to happen in the future, however. This is an extraordinarily weak formulation that is not worth a great deal. Nanomaterials can be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear indicators stating that they are damaging to health. I am therefore calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. Overall, however, I am satisfied with the results in this context. The perseverance of Parliament in its negotiations with the Council has paid off. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for this. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the obvious point of the new version of the first railway package is to secure profits for private businesses in the rail sector. The integrated public railway companies are to be destroyed by allowing subcontracts to be awarded and marshalling yards and maintenance works to be privatised and operated by private businesses from outside the railway industry. Despite the fact that experience in the United Kingdom shows that this is the wrong approach, nonetheless, this is the direction that is to be taken throughout the EU. This policy will have a negative impact not only on those working in the railway industry, but also on passenger safety. I strongly oppose the suggestion from the Right in Parliament, contrary to the majority opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that the right to strike should be removed by invoking the vital services principle. The railway sector is an integrated network that cannot be divided up into radical free-market, profit-oriented parts. We must not allow this to happen because it must remain possible to control the railway sector in a social, economic and ecological context into the future. It is for this reason that my group sides with the unions and clearly favours the retention of the integrated railway companies in public hands. These companies not only provide social stability for their employees, but also offer a guarantee of increased transport volumes. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, Mr Oettinger, I am outraged. The stress tests for nuclear power plants in the EU give the operators an alibi to continue running their reactors and are intended to conceal the actual danger represented by the so-called residual risks, in particular, if the power plants do not have to be shut down when the results of the stress tests are negative. The failure to include the risk of terrorism in the stress tests means that the profits of the nuclear power companies will be protected against costly modernisation measures. Radioactive radiation does not stop at national borders. In order to protect the people of Europe and its neighbouring countries, the EU should develop a Europe-wide exit strategy, call on its neighbours to get out of nuclear power as part of its neighbourhood policy and, in this way, prevent new nuclear power stations from being built. The prerequisite for this is the dissolution of the Euratom Treaty, which is used to promote the expansion of the nuclear industry. In the past, loans of more than EUR 500 million have been made available to Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine alone for the construction of new nuclear power stations. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, the EHEC epidemic is making apparent the flaws in the system of industrial food production in the liberalised Internal Market of the EU. When profits take priority over the protection of health, then food quality and food safety suffers. So far, at least 22 people have died in Germany as a result of the EHEC pathogen and there have been more than 1 500 cases of infection. In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders. After more than two weeks, the source of this life-threatening epidemic is still unclear. If we had regional production of foodstuffs, it would be easier to determine the source of infection and the effects of the epidemic would be more limited. As a result of the long transport routes and the anonymous production conditions, it is very difficult to trace the origin of the food. However, traceability with regard to the origin of the food is essential when it comes to food safety. Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from. The Federal Government in Germany completely failed in connection with the EHEC epidemic. In the confusion between regional and federal competences, management of the crisis fell by the wayside. The monitoring authorities were not prepared for this situation. We need a radical rethink in agricultural policy. Our food must be safe. However, agricultural producers should also be protected against incalculable financial risks. The policy for promoting agriculture and rural areas must consistently aim at a clear decentralisation of the food production and marketing structures. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, following the disaster of Chernobyl 25 years ago, new investigations by the Society for Radiation Protection show that to date 1.4 million people have died from the long-term consequences of the nuclear meltdown. Even in Germany we feared for the safety of our children, as they were exposed to radioactive rain clouds and contaminated foodstuffs. The EU must now take the right steps in responding to the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. The fears that the promised stress tests for all nuclear power plants would simply provide an excuse for the continued operation of reactors have unfortunately proven to be well-founded in the light of the stress criteria announced. Other nuclear facilities will not be examined. Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population. We are calling for extensive, binding stress tests carried out by independent experts. However this can only be the first step on the way to a Europe-wide nuclear exit scenario. Sabine Wils

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, illegal waste exports and the illegal disposal of waste pose an increasing threat to the health and environment of millions of people in developing countries. The volume of toxic waste is continuously increasing in the EU. Because of the high cost of recycling and disposing of waste, there is an enormous temptation to ship this waste to countries with less stringent environmental controls and lower disposal costs. I am pleased to find that this problem is accepted by all sides of the House and hope that Parliament will take a concerted approach to this issue. The legal loopholes that permit these hazardous exports must be closed. The existing regulations on the shipment of toxic waste to developing countries must be tightened up and enforced. We need a legislative proposal for environmental inspections, something that Parliament already called for in 2008, so that ships can be inspected effectively by the authorities in the local ports. This must also be linked with the possibility of impounding ships in ports throughout the EU if there are grounds to suspect breaches of the law. We propose that this should be reinforced in a joint resolution by all sides of the House. The entry of waste into the EU must also be better controlled. Off the coast of Calabria, just a few miles away from the port of Cetraro, there is a sunken vessel known for carrying highly toxic waste. It is assumed that many other toxic waste transporters have been sunk just off the coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea. This example illustrates the need for transparency in the shipment of waste and for reliable official inspections. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, there have recently been demonstrations in Germany in which 250 000 people called for an immediate exit from nuclear power and a changeover to 100% renewable energy. Both of these things are possible. After Chernobyl and Fukushima, it is clear that nuclear power will always involve a residual risk. Therefore, it must be mandatory for the nuclear safety standards throughout Europe to be based on the best available technologies. Despite the adoption of the Council Directive concerning the nuclear safety of nuclear installations in 2009, the existing safety standards remain in place in the Member States. Therefore, we urgently need a revision of this directive with the involvement of Parliament under the codecision procedure which is not based on the Euratom Treaty. I want to see an initiative involving as many of the groups in Parliament as possible which will call on the Council and the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to this effect. I believe that we need a nuclear exit scenario covering the whole of Europe. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

Madam President, Japan is still under threat of nuclear meltdown. Radiation from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima is rising dramatically. This is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power. That is why we are calling for an immediate abandonment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy lines the pockets of the power companies, but when an accident occurs it is the people who pay the price. For this reason, the EU must immediately lay down a requirement for the operators of nuclear power plants to hold mandatory public liability insurance. Sufficient cover must be provided for all damage to health, property and other assets in all Member States. The European Union should finally halt the promotion of nuclear energy and terminate the Euratom Treaty. Billions in taxpayers’ money is still being poured into a dangerous, high-risk technology, while safe alternatives like renewable energies remain under-funded. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

The Left has supported the introduction of a financial transaction tax for many years. This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market. We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin discussing light commercial vehicles, I would like to remind you that European car manufacturers have achieved the EU’s CO2
 product targets for cars several years before the deadline in 2015, by taking the appropriate technical measures. It is now clear that the manufacturers were seriously exaggerating during the negotiations on the time period and the targets for the CO2
 reduction measures for cars when these were subsequently watered down. The manufacturers have taken the same approach in their lobbying activities concerning the CO2
 reduction targets for light commercial vehicles. I would like to know how a majority here in Parliament can knowingly repeat this mistake and give in once again to the demands of the automotive industry. In this era of climate change, I believe that the important issues are protecting the environment and safeguarding the future of the human race. If Parliament would at least support the Commission’s proposal, this would put the European automotive industry at the cutting edge of technical development and, therefore, allow it to remain competitive. The Commission proposed a reduction target of 135 grams of CO2
 per kilometre. Following a transition period, the manufacturers would not be required to reach this limit until 2020. In my opinion, that would have been feasible. Instead of this, under pressure from the Council, a poor compromise was reached behind closed doors, according to which car manufacturers must now reduce the CO2
 emissions of light commercial vehicles to only 197 grams of CO2
 per kilometre by 2020. This feeble compromise is a gift to the industry. Super-credits, phase-in periods and pooling will water down what is already a weak limit even further. Lobbying by manufacturers among Members of this House and pressure from the vehicle manufacturing countries, namely Germany, France and Italy, in the Council have produced this poor result, which contains a whole series of loopholes. This report is unacceptable. It conflicts with the climate objectives of the EU and will slow down the pace of technical innovation. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will be voting against this report. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, the amount of waste equipment is increasing dramatically. Millions of tonnes of electric and electronic waste are produced in the EU every year and this represents a genuine hazard for people and the environment. I am pleased that the report by Mr Florenz recognises this problem and that we were able to introduce some pleasing improvements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety which had the support of all the groups. The stricter export regulations for electric and electronic waste are important. I hope that you, ladies and gentlemen, will support this regulation which, above all, will help to protect the people in those countries which are affected. However, I still do not agree with the exclusion of solar modules from the directive. I take a very critical view of the voluntary collection of items by producers. A few manufacturers use cadmium, which is a toxic substance, in their solar modules. The fact that modules are frequently removed by do-it-yourself enthusiasts presents an additional risk. Nanomaterials can also be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear instructions stating that they are damaging to health. Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market. This is why we have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I would like to ask you to support them. These are Amendments 101 and 102.

 Mr President, the draft directive on patient mobility could quickly lead to healthcare in the EU being reduced to the level of the lowest common denominator, by means of a service-based approach. My group is strongly opposed to the ability to pay becoming a criterion for the provision of healthcare and to patients being turned into customers. The proposed directive will enable health insurance companies to send patients abroad for cheaper treatment. This will lead to high levels of competition and pressure on prices in the healthcare sector. If a specific treatment is available more cheaply a few hundred kilometres away, and if patients are sent there by their insurance companies, the result will be that this particular treatment will no longer be available locally. Therefore, the health sector will simply be following the neoliberal logic of the market, instead of giving priority to patients’ welfare. I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, whether you want to see health tourism in this sensitive sector. I am in favour of patients receiving healthcare close to where they live. This is a public responsibility as part of the provision of services of general interest, which must be available for everyone in their local area. Sabine Wils,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Madam President, grinding, mixing, cheating – these are the three buzzwords of the feed industry in Germany. Since 1999, there have been five dioxin scandals in Germany alone. Feed manufacturers and large food companies are clearly not concerned about EU directives and national legislation when it comes to making large profits with cheap food. Competition for the lowest price in the food market is fierce in Germany. Feed for intensive livestock farming is therefore intended to be as cheap as possible. State checks are rarely carried out on feed and food producers. The state has increasingly relied on self checking by the manufacturer and saved itself the expense of employing qualified staff. Under these conditions, technical fat waste contaminated with dioxins was able to find its way into the feed and foodstuffs chain. The current dioxin scandal could have been prevented if the fat had been tested for dioxins before it was mixed into the feed. The contamination would then have been detected in time. Numerous consumers have now been contaminated with additional dioxins once again. Eighty percent of our intake of dioxins enters our bodies via foodstuffs of animal origin – in other words, meat, milk and eggs. Foodwatch is rightly demanding that feed manufacturers be placed under obligation to test every batch of feed ingredients for dioxins and PCBs before they mix the feed. Absolutely no ingredients that do not comply with the limit values may be included in the feed. Highly contaminated batches must be destroyed, and it must be possible to prove that this has indeed been done. That is the only way to prevent further adulteration and dilution of contaminants. Laboratories must also be placed under obligation to report cases where the limit values are exceeded to the national supervisory authorities. We need to introduce a labelling requirement for meat to enable its traceability. The current and previous food scandals in Germany have shown that routine state checks on the feed manufacturers and animal producers are essential. How do you intend to implement that Commissioner?

 Despite the improvements to the European citizens’ initiative resulting from the compromise between the Commission and Parliament, it still involves unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. In addition, there is the risk that it will be used as a tool, for example by large companies and organisations, because although transparency is guaranteed, there is no limit on donations from businesses. For these reasons among others, we have abstained in the final vote. Some of our criticisms are as follows: 1. Businesses are not excluded from the initiative. 2. No decision has been made about whether younger citizens can take part from the age of 16. Instead this is dependent on national electoral law. 3. Third-party nationals who live in the EU cannot take part. 4. No compensation is available above 100 000 signatures (EUR 0.005 per signature). As a result, the initiative will be very costly for the initiators and, therefore, is not equally accessible to all. 5. There is no ban on company donations in support of a European citizens’ initiative and they have no upper limit. 6. No specific information is provided about the possibility of appealing to the Court of Justice of the Europe Union if an initiative is rejected. 7. If the European Commission rejects a related draft legislative text, it is not obliged to justify its decision. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the climate conference in Cancún must exert positive pressure on our states in order to make progress in terms of international cooperation and national climate protection legislation. As part of an alliance of responsibility, the EU must demonstrate political leadership, regardless of what the United States does, and allow itself to be judged by the principle of climate justice. This means that there must be a second commitment period for the industrialised nations under the Kyoto Protocol. Additional funds must be provided for financing climate measures. With regard to long-term financing, the EU must lay its cards on the table in the negotiations. The EU must present ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases. The global temperature must under no circumstances increase by more than 1.5°C. This target will result in technical innovations and create jobs at a time of economic crisis. Sabine Wils,

Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, who has done a good job and salvaged what was possible in the face of great resistance from the Council and the majority here in Parliament. One major success of the new version is the open scope. This approach is exemplary and I am pleased that we were able to agree on it. On the negative side is the fact that the list of six substances that were already banned has not been expanded to include substances such as chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, phthalates and PVC. Although there is sufficient evidence of the risk to health that these substances present, they will not be banned in 2011 when the new version is in force. Certain leading electronics manufacturers have been placing products such as mobile phones, televisions and laptops that do not contain these pollutants on the market on a voluntary basis for a number of years, and without any great increase in costs. We have passed up a great opportunity here to make the growing electrical and electronics industry a little more environmentally friendly. Leading manufacturers are showing us the way. Instead of supporting these manufacturers with good initiatives, however, the EU is behind the times. It is the poor of this world that will suffer as a result. After all, every year, we dump millions of tonnes of toxic electrical and electronic waste on them. The poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the European Union. Sabine Wils,

 Mr President, biocides form part of many cleaning products, disinfectants, insect sprays and other everyday products which people come into contact with in the course of their daily lives. There are currently more than 50 000 biocide products in the European Union. I would like to make it perfectly clear to everyone that biocides are mainly used by private citizens. Biocides are often non-biodegradable, in some cases, carcinogenic, highly toxic substances, and can cause harm to people, animals and the environment when they are being used and disposed of. People and young children in particular are especially at risk when biocides are used in the home, for example, in the form of wood preservatives and insect sprays. It is true that the manufacturers say that their products are not hazardous if they are used properly. However, given that 400 000 tonnes of biocides are sold to and used by private individuals in the EU every year, it is important that improper use and the occurrence of accidents are taken into consideration. As this has not yet been the case, I have tabled an amendment on this subject and I would ask you vote in favour of it. This is Amendment 352. Should the purpose of this regulation be to increase the free circulation of biocidal products within the European Union as the Commission has proposed? Or is this House more concerned with protecting people and the environment? It is essential that we introduce a strict ban on particularly hazardous substances. We must make a decision which supports the cause of consumers, otherwise we will be putting people’s health at risk. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, two phases of postal service liberalisation have already been implemented. The Commission has not, as yet, published a single study dealing solely with social conditions and the impact on postal workers of the opening up of the market. My question to you, Commissioner Barnier, is when will this study be made available to Parliament at long last? Yesterday, we heard from numerous postal workers from several EU Member States that entire workforces are already being dismissed by the new postal companies and re-employed under poorer conditions. Competition and competition policy must not be played out at the expense of the workers. If the Commission and Parliament really want to do something to combat poverty and exclusion in the EU, the third phase of the postal service liberalisation must now be discontinued. The consequences for postal workers and the quality of the universal service must first be investigated. We therefore call for a moratorium on the third phase of postal service liberalisation for the sake of customers and postal workers. Sabine Lösing and Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Unfortunately, the joint resolution’s recitals contain a positive reference to the European Security Strategy (ESS) and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which I and my group reject. But due to the very high importance of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries I and the GUE/NGL group signed the joint resolution on the entry into force of the CCM and the role of the EU, as this joint resolution must be seen as a great success in order to ban cluster munitions.

– I welcome the motion for a resolution on the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Kampala, Uganda, as it contains very crucial and important points and requests regarding the ratification and the implementation of the ICC. Therefore, I voted in favour. But I want to express my deep concerns about certain phrases in the resolution, which refer positively to the ‘Stockholm Programme’, the ‘EIDHR’ and to the European Union as a ‘Global Player’. In this matter, the ‘Stockholm Programme’ and the ‘EIDHR’ might have had a positive impact, but in many other areas, these two programmes/instruments are not used in a democratic and transparent manner. The European Union has indeed been acting as a ‘Global Player’ but, in my view, not at all in a positive way towards a more fair and solidary world order. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, the United Nations climate conference failed due to the hard-nosed political interests of the industrialised nations. As a result, the basis for existence of billions of people in developing countries and in the island nations at risk of being submerged is in jeopardy. There is no agreement on how we are to effectively limit the further warming of the planet. The EU played the game in the interests of its national undertakings and the profits of the large concerns. The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU Member States by a total of 30% by 2020 was not brought to the table early enough. Making better climate protection targets dependent on the prior concessions of other States is playing dice with the future of humanity. The facts are clear: in 2007, CO2
 emissions per person were 4.6 tonnes in China, in Germany they were 9.7 tonnes and in the US 19.1 tonnes. We urgently need climate justice for the whole of humanity. Next year in Mexico City, the industrialised nations and emerging economies must come to a binding agreement with specific and ambitious targets. Sabine Wils  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, in many parts of the world the consequences of climate change are visible. The most recent calculations assume a global temperature rise of up to 4° C by 2060, and up to 10° C in the Arctic. It is primarily Europe’s soot emissions that are responsible for the significantly faster melting of the ice in the Arctic – they are borne there by the wind. The rich industrial States of the EU are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change. USD 100 billion will be needed every year from 2010 to 2050. Of that amount, it is fair to say that USD 30 billion is not too much for the European Union. The transfer of technology must also not be linked to patents, or else some of the money will simply be flowing straight back to the corporations in the industrialised countries. The EU has an obligation to take a lead at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, Commissioner, I very much like your proposal regarding the productivity-aligned wage policy. When it comes to the minimum wage, however, you have given in to Chancellor Merkel, and I do not believe you when it comes to increasing employment in health care. How are new jobs supposed to emerge there when the Commission has already forced southern and eastern Member States to reduce their hospital capacities by a half? How are jobs supposed to arise in health care when the Commission requires some Member States to reduce their expenditure on health care further in the new country-specific recommendations for the European Semester? I fear that this point in this plan is pure gesture politics, not a real initiative for new jobs. On the contrary, there is already a shortage of drugs and medicines as a result of the austerity measures, and not just in Greece. I feel that if we are constantly designing new rescue packages for the banks, then we must now work for a rescue package for people and, in particular, to secure medical supplies in the crisis countries.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what should worry us and make us panic is not simply the sheer numbers of unemployed young people in Europe, but the way this is developing. Between 2008 and 2011, the number of unemployed young people rose by 26.5%, according to the International Labour Organisation. It is this development that necessitates urgent measures, for we are not only cutting off an entire generation from the labour market – we are cutting off an entire generation from a future worth living. If we allow our young people to feel completely useless, it is no wonder that young people are turning away from this EU because they have no reasonable prospect of work or life opportunities. I would really urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the measures decided on to counter this are initiated. I can see some things being done, but please ensure that the many years’ of mental doldrums are not now replaced by a flurry of activity. When I read that the Commission is starting a programme under which young people will now be given financial assistance if they apply for a job abroad, then we are starting a migration circus that will not solve the problem. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive; because technicians, doctors, engineers and care workers will then be poached by the richer countries that are not in this crisis. In this crisis, which is the cause of this development, what we need are offensive measures; namely, the phasing out of this lunatic austerity that is stifling Europe’s economy. We need a targeted growth policy, we need a strengthening of domestic purchasing power, and public investments in education, research and alternative energies. That would be the right approach. Combined with European subsidies, it would then be possible actually to develop an integrated concept that creates some prospects for the lives of young people. I have one final comment to make, and that is that this youth unemployment cannot be reconciled with the nonsense about wanting to raise the retirement age to 70. We need a different policy here that allows young people access to the labour market. That is what I am urgently calling for. Thomas Händel,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speculation was a major factor in triggering the crisis, while credit default swaps (CDSs) and short selling have been a major factor in heightening the crisis. These instruments have degenerated into purely speculative instruments. Some people in the financial sector seem to have incorrectly regarded or misused these instruments as a personal licence to print money. As a result, entire economies have suffered, along with nation states and, above all, the people of the countries concerned. To this extent, the fact that the Commission has finally taken the initiative and realised that regulation is necessary is to be welcomed. Whether or not the regulation will be strict remains to be seen. I expressly welcome the work and the efforts by the rapporteur, Mr Canfin, to improve the regulation tabled and to put a stop to the gambling. What is needed is a de facto
 ban on naked short selling and the prevention of speculation in the future. We also need strict regulation and, above all, a strong supervisory authority in Europe. I fear, however, that as the negotiations continue, the interests of the financial centres – London and Frankfurt in particular – will override the interests of the majority of the people of Europe. If that happens we will be left with little more than a Swiss cheese in which the holes are probably larger than what is left. That is quite definitely not something my group could support.

 Madam President, Mr Andor, ladies and gentlemen, I understand from what you have said, Mr Andor, that the European Commission is obviously taking notice of this subject. I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint. It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do. On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation. Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households. This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers. Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission. The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers. For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support. I would like to comment on four points. Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention. If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place. Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area. Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights. Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector. I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions. This is a good thing. We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Mr President, public procurement law and the awarding of public contracts are an essential part of the internal market. Mr Barnier, my response to your remarks about wanting to promote social integration in this context is that I have heard very little about protecting social rights or about protecting collective agreements. These are some of the fundamental rules which you, as you have said, do not want to call into question. If we want to protect the fundamental rules, we must ensure in future, during the process of awarding public contracts, that basic social standards are maintained, that collective agreements are not undermined, and that the use of cheap labour is prevented. All of this forms part of modern public procurement law. I would like to make it clear that we must no longer put greater emphasis on economic freedoms and free competition than on fundamental social rights. Either we want a social Europe or we want permanent conflict with the people who are turning away from Europe because it does not protect their interests. Thomas Händel,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rescue packages were intended to protect EU Member States from insolvency. However, they are overwhelming citizens with brutal austerity programmes and allowing the perpetrators to get off scot-free. On top of that, the Commission is now interfering in national wage policy, too. Mr Hahn, it is quite absurd and it brings tears to my eyes when I hear formal arguments like yours that this is not at all intended to be a socio-political measure. Such a position is utterly unacceptable. Wage policy is not the business of the EU. This policy on the part of the Commission is at complete odds with the idea of this European Union. The EU was never intended to be about competition in wages and social dumping. This Commission policy talks about the inflexibility of wages, which is to be reduced. It states that wages should reflect market conditions. This is like a blind man describing an elephant. People who write such things have no understanding of collective agreement systems. They interfere in free collective bargaining and reduce the much talked-about autonomy of the social partners and the social dialogue to absurdity. I would like to make it clear that this Parliament is called on to ensure that the autonomous collective agreement policy is retained, to protect the social dialogue and to prevent the further dismantling of social security. We need measures to prevent a counterproductive austerity policy, not punitive measures. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prosperity of a country is created through the work of its people. In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid. People want proper, secure pensions in their old age. One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable. In contrast, occupational and private pension funds have lost millions of euro on the stock exchange. It is ridiculous to increase the focus on private, capital-based pension systems when providing for people’s retirement. The public has financed the rescue packages for the major banks. The people are paying for a tough austerity policy which is under the control of the European Union. Now, they are supposed to turn around national budgets by taking cuts in their pensions and accepting a higher retirement age. Previous pension reforms are already leading to increasing poverty in old age. The only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension systems. Thomas Händel,  
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to this report, the Commission is following a successful policy on competition. However, we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment, so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider. In the European Union, free competition continues to take precedence over the social needs of our citizens. A fervent belief in free markets cannot mask the fact that these markets not only fail time and time again, but are also incapable of bringing about lasting social justice. A couple of procedures aimed at combating distortion of competition and price fixing will not be enough to resolve this problem. A fair and social internal market will only work with strong and just regulation. More work is urgently needed on this. For example, it is not acceptable for more and more institutions providing services of general public interest to find themselves exposed to private competition. The report sets down pointers for the Commission’s future policy on competition. There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels. It is also necessary to introduce a contractual clause that favours secure social progress and that is regarded with the same importance as the rules on competition in Europe. Thomas Händel,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have undoubtedly made progress in recent years on the issue of equality between men and women, yet there are still many women who are forced into low-skilled jobs. That applies not just to activities that are traditionally carried out within the family. The deregulation that has taken place in recent years has frequently resulted in employment that provides mandatory social insurance being replaced by employment conditions that are atypical, precarious and uncertain. Women, in particular, have been affected by this. The trend in employment in Europe between 2000 and 2010 is for 60% to be made up of new, precarious and atypical types of employment, primarily – two thirds – taken up by women. Women are frequently debarred from democratic participation in organisations by virtue of being employed on a part-time basis and on precarious conditions. Yet women are now much more committed and better trained than in any previous generation. Nonetheless, on average, they earn 25% less than men. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has looked into this matter intensively and has developed good proposals on the issue of female employment: inclusion in social security systems regardless of job status; the establishment of childcare facilities; aligning retirement pensions and social systems with independent living; and organising work according to ‘good work’ principles. All this is essentially contained in the report on precarious women workers. The Employment Committee is satisfied with the results of this work and urges the House to vote in favour of the report presented. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal for integrated guidelines for more and better jobs has been significantly improved by the work of Parliament. Despite a number of improvements, we are still a long way from achieving our goals. We do not deny the fact that improvements have been made with regard to the equality of men and women, but it would have been better to integrate a separate guideline into this set of guidelines. We will request this very forcefully in plenary tomorrow. Secondly, it is important that the evaluation of the results and the reporting obligations are firmly established within Parliament’s sphere of competence and that there are now more exacting objectives and sub-goals with regard to labour market participation and active labour market policy in the report. However, it would be important for Parliament to confirm tomorrow that the ILO principles relating to good and decent work as well as the question of a minimum income that is clearly above the poverty line are taken into consideration in the report. I am, however, of the opinion that this report still has a number of shortcomings. It is far too reminiscent of the old Lisbon strategy. The failed flexicurity principles have been repeated like a mantra and much of the wording smacks of the old deregulation policy. Secondly, if principles such as the compatibility of work and family life, social cohesion, sustainable economic management, investments and education are mentioned but there are no specific measures to follow this, it represents a weakness in the report. For more and better employment, it would be necessary to place the focus on reducing the precariousness of the current situation and to emphasise the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work in the same place’, to make the model of full-time employment the central focus once again, to limit the maximum working week and consider reducing working hours and, above all, with regard to cohesion, to incorporate social progress as a mandatory element and not permit any backward steps.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the responsibility in this European Parliament to regulate the financial markets firmly. All the proposals we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues. The Council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights. Mr Giegold is right when he described what is currently going on as ‘parochial’. The intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations, but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down. We will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets. Inadequate conclusions are being drawn from this financial and economic crisis, which means that the next crisis is already brewing. Many national economies, including those in Europe, will not withstand the blows to come, with all the social and economic repercussions this entails for people living in Europe. They are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored. If the CEO of UniCredit Bank, Alessandro Profumo, says as he did at the weekend that we need a strong, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority and a common set of rules for all Member States, calling for tighter capital rules, this is an appeal to this Parliament to actually draw up these rules. It is this European Parliament’s job to exert pressure on the Council and enforce effective regulation as a matter of urgency. This would be just the first step to a status quo ante
. It is finally time for the grandiose promises to be backed up by actions. My group supports strong European regulation. Any other situation, without regulations, would pose a danger to the euro, a single EU and democracy. Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have been debating the matter of driving time and working hours in road transport for months. I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths? What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work. As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘Let’s see what happens’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious. My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence. Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House! Thomas Händel  (GUE/NGL

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the G20 summit in Pittsburgh provided a good model. It demanded economic recovery plans in order to promote decent work, which will contribute to security and the creation of jobs, and it made the growth of employment a priority. I therefore call on Europe’s labour ministers to press the G20 members, firstly, not to go back on their economic recovery packages, but to work harder and to a greater extent to create jobs; secondly, to work to provide financially secure short-time work to prevent the loss of jobs; thirdly, to promote public investment for the creation of jobs and sustainable ecological growth and, fourthly, to strengthen and extend social security measures to enable access to these measures. That will also safeguard purchasing power within the internal market as well as employment and will help to combat poverty. Cooperation with the social partners is apparently very important to Europe’s labour ministers in order to strengthen the social dialogue to an even greater extent than desired by the Commissioner.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports. However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it. Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation. What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme – at best, it is a nanofinance programme! Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out. Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable. Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme. Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect. Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way. In this form, we will reject this programme. Thomas Händel,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share much of what the Commission has put forward here on the causes and the prospects for the car industry – overcapacities, the need to change strategy, new technologies. However, I would like to point out that there are a number of things that we do not share. Opel will probably not be the last case in the car industry, where there is 30% overcapacity across the globe. We are not only talking about the approximately 12 million people who directly or indirectly live off this industry but the roughly 30 million people throughout Europe who are involved in this industry’s economic output. In this situation, the Commission shares responsibility for ensuring that the European car industry is able to master this challenge. The Commission also shares responsibility for ensuring that Opel does not now become the sacrificial pawn of a free-market clean-up of the crisis. The necessary re-alignment of the management of free market forces in this Union will not automatically balance the anticipated job losses with new jobs. On the contrary, indeed, those in jobs and European national economies will pay the price. The general prevention of State aid will lead to the advent not only of distortions of competition but also social distortions. These will then take a much bigger toll on the coffers of the affected countries than they can afford and, above all, much more than those coffers would be burdened by the aid currently being offered, when you include the dismantlement of social services. The restructuring of the European car industry needs strong initiatives from the Commission, but also from the relevant national governments. We therefore propose a European industry council on the future of mobility involving politicians, businesses, trade unions and academics. It would have to develop possible courses of action for the necessary technical changes and define political measures and the associated funding. Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens. That applied years ago to the steel industry, and it must now apply to Opel and to the car industry in Europe as a whole. State aid can and, in my view, must also be linked to achieving an institutionalised employee participation with extended rights of codecision. All affected employees in Europe need security for their sites, they need new work and new, secure future prospects across Europe.
