The injustices committed against our fishermen are compounded by the injustice done to our oyster farmers and shellfish breeders in the Thau Basin and Bacarès Pond in the Aude département
. They are effectively footing the bill for the massive pollution caused during the summer by the thousands upon thousands of camper vans parked there by tourists from Northern Europe, who daily empty their waste water, infested with phosphates and even pathogenic bacteria, into the ponds of the Languedoc and Catalan regions. For the Mediterranean and for our fishermen, oyster farmers and shellfish breeders, Europe means restriction and pollution without compensation.

 For 20 years now the Commission’s political strategy in the area of fisheries and with regard to our fishermen has been clear; place limits on our boats, on our nets and on our catch. The justification appears to make sense; fishery resources, such as cod, are dwindling, so in order for stocks to be saved and for a sustainable recovery to take place, our fishermen have to reduce their fishing effort immediately. This has given rise to the measures that we have seen, which place restrictions on net size, on driftnets, on boat power, on building new boats and on total allowable catches (TAC), all of which forms part of the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP). Unfortunately, while our fishermen are hamstrung and their vessels in a state of disrepair, factory ships from Japan, Russia and elsewhere are plundering the fishery resource in French waters. In the waters off Sète and the coast of Languedoc-Roussillon, vessels smaller than 12 metres have been refused permission to modernise, on the grounds that this would breach the kWh limit, thereby jeopardising their safety. Meanwhile, France is buying more than EUR 2 billion worth of fish and seafood that Brussels bans us from fishing.

 Mr President, deriving its inspiration from the Greens and from the health fanatics, a majority has voted not only against the growing of tobacco but also – it is not clear why – against the cultivation of olive groves. All this is prompted by the simple logic according to which tobacco causes lung cancer, so all that needs to be done to do away with lung cancer is to stop growing the stuff. It is an unfortunate fact that 75% of the tobacco smoked in Europe, amounting to 540 000 tonnes, is imported, in particular from Brazil, and so banning our 350 000 tonnes of European tobacco, 25 000 tonnes of which come from France, will have no effect on cancer whatever. On the contrary, it will put a question mark over 50 000 French jobs, at Sarlat, Tonneins, Lille and elsewhere. In Europe, a total of 500 000 jobs are at risk, many of them being done by women – who, in any case have fewer resources and are hence less able to fight against cancer. What is the reasoning behind this hastily cobbled-together policy? It is that the European Commission has no love for tobacco-growers, winegrowers, olive farmers and the people who work the land. Brussels is all in favour of preferential treatment for foreign agriculture, and so it even prefers lung cancer to be imported.

 Cod is an example of how fishery resources are not inexhaustible. In order to conserve them, the Commission is constantly flanking our fishing effort with a variety of instruments for managing stocks and boats. Withdrawals from stocks are limited by total allowable catches, which are broken down into national quotas. The number of boats is constantly being cut by means of the financial instrument for fisheries guidance. The Regulation of 20 December 2002 on the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources takes up these instruments, but serves in particular as a basis for a third instrument of management proposed on 27 June 2003, limiting the fishing effort in kilowatt-days. If stocks are not to fall below the biomass limit, 100 000 tonnes in the case of Northern hake, for example, the number of days boats are absent from port would be limited on the basis of their power. Apart from this tool’s complexity, what is the use of setting our European fishermen aside if the stocks released in that way are overexploited by the Japanese, the Russians and other practitioners of industrial fishing?

Trains used to run, planes used to fly, the post used to arrive, healthcare used to exist, schools used to teach and there was light, all thanks to national public services. But the Commission of Brussels wants to privatise them, flying in the face of reason, fact and social concerns. Intelligence takes a back seat as we slip from the glorious notion of services provided to the public, in the name of the common good and the res publica
, to the wretched concept of services provided by general interest. Market integrationism flies in the face of facts when it refuses to see that private trains in Britain are derailing, that electricity in California is cutting out, that the planes of private airlines such as Flash Airlines are crashing and that American commercial schools are leaving souls helpless. Social concerns are sacrificed because with liberalisation, there is two-tier access to healthcare, university, transport or even water: services for the rich and services for the poor. All this is led by Mr Herzog, the communist rapporteur who has become ‘party to the rout’ of economic and social democracy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, my region, Languedoc-Roussillon, Provence, the whole of southern France, is again stricken by floods. It is true that we have benefited from the solidarity of German and Italian firemen, but the reality as I speak to you now, the reality there even now is that there are hundreds and hundreds of dead bulls and sheep that people are still unable to recover from the flooded pastures and farms. The reality is that in many small villages, like Codole in Gard, 98% of the houses were destroyed seven days before Christmas, hundreds of families are homeless, with definite budgetary realities. EUR 700 000 are needed for just one kilometre of dyke, EUR 150 000 in one small village to rebuild the roads, millions of euros to reconstruct public buildings, schools, multipurpose rooms, water treatment plants and sewer networks. The reality in a small village is EUR 5 000 every day to feed the homeless, the security services, families, even the military who are on guard to prevent looting; it is at least EUR 40 000 to 80 000 for every damaged house, and there are thousands of them. That is the most important of it. What is to be done? Who will pay? From which budget? Will it be the local authorities, the region, France or Europe? In theory, Mr President, Commissioner, there are solidarity mechanisms. There is even a solidarity principle in Article 2 of the treaty. There are mechanisms on paper: the ERDF, Objective 2, the EAGGF guarantee which came into play for mad cow disease, direct advances for farmers that were used after the August 2002 floods, the 2000-2004 programme for civil defence and the new Solidarity Fund. In this connection, we all know, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that the Fund’s strict eligibility criteria and the modest EUR 1 billion allocated to it, which, incidentally, has already been swallowed up by the fires in Portugal or the earthquakes in Italy, are leaving my compatriots of Languedoc-Roussillon very much alone as Christmas approaches. If, in the case we are concerned with, we have seen the coming of the floods but not of the euros, we must at least work for the future. First, by funding a real time information system, which does not exist since the mayors were not alerted. In these days in which we are living we need an electronic computer system from Lyons to Arles that will allow all the rivers, dykes, canals, arms and tributaries of the Rhône basin to be monitored in real time and the local elected representatives to be alerted in case of danger. The province of Murcia in Spain has done it, Mr President; we ought to be able to. The crux of the matter lies elsewhere, however. Beyond prevention, reconstruction and compensation we must see that the floods of water mask the reality of a demographic flood. The senior citizens of northern Europe, not to mention the executives of the Paris region, come and make their homes in Languedoc-Roussillon, in Provence and throughout the south of France. Land is expropriated, the ground concreted over, 150 000 hectares of vines have flooded, and this is why, to cut a long story short, the area is swamped. What is more, the Dutch, English, Belgian and northern active European seniors will become truly aged citizens and demand extensive health care infrastructures in our region. To conclude, the overhaul of the Structural Funds must anticipate this territorial justice: if populations are transferred from north to south, the funding must be transferred as well, otherwise we will become the Palestinians of Europe, seeing colonies of senior citizens from Northern Europe settled among us. We do not want to be a permanently devastated West Bank in the South of France!

 The European Commission is pursuing its efforts to construct an area of unbridled global free trade in which the workers of the South, with no competitive advantage but their poverty, are used as a weapon against the workers of the northern hemisphere. This regression strategy, which has already hit the men and women who work in our textile, leather, steel, coal and electronics industries, not to mention our rural populations, is now being applied to the service sector – all in the name of ultraliberal globalism. This is why Brussels has targeted port services, cargo-handling, pilots and dockers. Disregarding the need for safety and prepared to dismantle the social progress achieved through a century of struggles, the ideologists of Euro-federalism and the Talibans of free trade want to man their merchant vessels, many of them sailing under flags of convenience, with immigrant labour from Asia and the developing world that will undertake all the work and services currently performed by French workers in ports from Sète to Bordeaux, from Marseilles to Dunkirk, Le Havre or Anvers. And so I, who represent the town of Sète in the European Parliament, and the movement led by Jean-Marie Le Pen say no to this policy of the slave shippers of global free trade, which is the scourge of nations.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, changes, or new features, have clearly been added to the European budget for 2004: it has been described as a budget for a Europe of twenty-five, with a new nomenclature, based on activities, objectives and targets. This does not necessarily make the budget easier reading when, for example, we have 215 activities instead of the distinction previously made between administrative and operational expenditure. Furthermore, we will soon also have the new feature that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure will be removed and, one of these days, we will see the budgetisation of the European Development Fund (EDF). When that day comes, however, will we in this House still be able to complete a discussion on the matter in two hours as well as take a vote on EUR 100 billion’s worth of spending? There is, therefore, a deficit in budgetary democracy, ample proof of which is the fact that this Chamber is completely empty! There are also other budgetary deficits, first of all in the reliability of the forecasts. There are the figures for outstanding commitments: between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion of unused appropriations each year, and this is a problem, especially when, on top of this, we do not have enough money to give to beekeepers, sheep farmers, fishermen, and so on. There is also a deficit in budgetary justice: year after year – this is a truism – Europe has its winners and its losers and they are always the same people! The Spain of Mr Aznar, who preaches to the whole world about budgetary balance, receives royalties worth EUR eight billion every year and without this income Spain would enjoy no budgetary balance at all. At the same time, other countries that form a majority, pay up – France and Germany, for example. In France, we lose between EUR 2 and EUR 4 billion every year, which is the equivalent of one TGV line every year! Something is clearly wrong! There is also a deficit in the hierarchy of budgetary priorities: it is all well and good to earmark EUR 200 million for the reconstruction of Iraq, to give another EUR 200 million to Afghanistan, and EUR 240 million to Turkey to cover pre-accession costs, but should these really be priorities when the whole of Europe has only EUR 600 million in 2004, with which it can build the equivalent of a few kilometres of TGV line? Should we be spending EUR 640 million on Afghanistan, Turkey and Iraq – which nobody forced us to destroy – when we cannot even build high-speed rail links or major transport networks? The budget contains a perversion of solidarity, which in turn reveals a fourth deficit; a deficit of coherence. This is a Europe that, at Lisbon, stated its desire to be the number one world power in the field of knowledge, which Nikita Khrushchev wanted for his country as long ago as 1960, in order to beat the United States. This is a Europe of Erasmus Mundus, which wants to be a global university, a Europe of major works à la 
Pericles, a Europe of universal external policy, a Shiva with one thousand arms, in Cotonou or Mercosur, in Asia, in South Africa, ‘everything but arms’, for the poor and even for the rich. And yet, this Europe of global dimensions has a truly provincial budget of EUR 100 billion, in other words, one per cent of its GDP, and this percentage is not increasing. Given the contradiction between these global ambitions and this laughable budget, the question is raised as to where the truth about Europe lies. The answer is to be found in the budgets: year after year, Europe churns out impressive-sounding speeches which, in reality, fall considerably short of what is needed.

 Beekeepers keep on sounding the alarm. Bee populations have been falling for years in proportions that put pollination at risk. Why has this health disaster occurred? No doubt the acarid varroa parasite is partly responsible, as in Germany where, in 2002, it destroyed 40% of the bee population. Bayer’s Gaucho (imidaclopride) pesticide and BASF’s Regent (fipronil) pesticide bear a very heavy responsibility for these excessive mortality rates, however. The German company, Bayer dared in vain to sue the former vice-president of France’s Beekeepers’ Union for ‘defamation’ in June 2003. The facts speak for themselves. When melliferous, sunflower, maize or rape crops are treated with these pesticides in the vicinity of bee colonies, the latter show serious behavioural problems and die en masse
. The precautionary principle therefore requires that, at the very least, these two neurotoxic pesticides be urgently withdrawn in anticipation of serious in vivo
, and no longer in vitro
, studies involving biologists specialising in the life of bees and representatives of the beekeepers. It is necessary right now to compensate the beekeepers who have sustained losses and to put an end to the unreasonable imports of foreign honey, which is sometimes adulterated and always offered on a dumping basis.

Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, obviously one might well regret an error of analysis in the power relationships at Cancún. You spoke of two elephants; perhaps the third one escaped you. Fifty years after Bandung, we have Cancún and the return of the non-aligned, even if they have multiplied. More to the point, a mistake was made on 13 August 2003, with the EU-US agreement, which blurred the pro-development image which you wanted to create, especially with the ‘Everything but arms’ programme, and you gave the impression, to use your words, of a ‘duopoly’. It is certain that this preliminary agreement with the United States, which came in the wake of the 1992 Blair House agreement, put you and us in the same boat as the Texas cotton planters and their USD 3.5 billion subsidies, which are creating financial hardship for the 10 million small African planters. Europe is certainly not responsible for this failure, however, if stopping the drift of ultraliberalism can indeed be called a failure. During the election campaign, the American administration did not want an agreement any more than, in Seattle, the African countries could not accept the contempt of paragraph 27 of the final declaration, telling them to grow something other than cotton. You, on the other hand, you have made every sacrifice, you have sacrificed our farmers in advance, you have sacrificed two out of the four Singapore issues, you were even prepared to give them the shirt off our back, provided that the textile agreement was brought to a close, but they did not want our shirt in Cancún. What is to be done, then? Obviously we wait for the investiture of the new American president in January 2005. What is to be done about the common agricultural policy (CAP)? Good sense, justice, would want us to withdraw the rules on the CAP since it was the price to be paid for the Cancún goods which were not delivered. What is to be done about cotton? Do we sacrifice our 3% share of the world market or make the Africans a gift of what they wanted: a trust fund of USD 250 million per year organised by an international institution? What is to be done at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)? You say we have to change medieval procedures. You could say that of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), you could say that of the UN, you could say that, moreover, of the European Commission itself. Which means that the institutional question is much broader. How in future can we legally reconcile, on the one hand, inescapable globalisation at economic, media and technological levels with, on the other hand, the equally inescapable and eternal perpetuity of the political nations which, for their part, have the decision-making powers? Obviously, no one has the answer as to how to modify the WTO. At all events, however, it needs to be sought in teleology, not theology, because there can be no doubt that the theology of the ‘free-tradist’ sect, the madrasas of Washington or Geneva which train the market fanatics, the Taliban of ultraliberalism, constitute between them an ideological error of global proportions. This is because the right aims, which will bring about the right solutions, are not ultraliberalism, privatisation or the market, but social justice, political justice and national justice. This being so, Commissioner, we wish you good luck in your new office after June 2004, and I admit that I await with a little thrill of greedy curiosity to see where your golden parachute lands.

 With a right of withdrawal, recognised at the end of its first part, and with the need, recognised at the end of its fourth part, for ‘constitutional’ amendments to be ratified unanimously, the ‘European Constitution’ has in those ways incorporated two sane benchmarks into a document that, at the start, insanely took the law into its own hands by stealing the designation ‘constitution’ in order to cover up its intergovernmental nature. With more than 400 articles, progress is being made in the following areas: the classification of legal acts as European laws, framework laws or ‘delegated’ laws; and the creation of a Minister of Foreign Affairs and three Presidents – of the European Council, the Council of Ministers and the Commission – and of a whole orchestra of institutional instruments in which, although the conductor cannot be tracked down, it is easy to locate the big drum of the European Parliament which, once more, is gaining in volume without managing to gain in political credibility. While making a lot of noise with its institutional ironmongery, the European Constitution still remains silent, however, on two subjects of major importance: on the one hand, - the necessary protection of democracies crushed by the media power of empires ranging from Murdoch’s to Berlusconi’s; and on the other hand, - the protection of taxpayers against what will be ever more punitive taxes.

 Mr President, 12 000 people died in 10 days. That is three times as many as died in the Twin Towers. A thousand people died per day, alone, abandoned. The corpses were stored in refrigerated lorries, in army caissons, in a fruit and vegetable market in Rungis in Paris. Not since Neanderthal man, long before Antigone, has the law of burial been violated. Where is this Timisoara taking place? Under Milosevic? In Baghdad, under Saddam Hussein? In Haider’s Austria? In the camps under the guards mentioned by Berlusconi? In Somalia, in the Rwanda of 1000 hills? It is in France. The France of the World Athletics Championships, the France of human rights, the France of gold medals, the France of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the father of the Constitution, the first article of which recognizes the right to dignity, including dignity for the elderly. Where did all these deaths occur? Sixty-six percent of the deaths occurred in old people’s homes, hospitals and specialised centres. They were not given enough to drink. They died of dehydration. Why is that? Because there were no nurses, no staff, no doctors. Why? Because the budgetary Stability Pact demands savings and cuts have to be made. As a result, cuts have been made to the detriment of the weakest, who cannot protest, to the detriment of the elderly. Most of those who died were women. They did not die from domestic violence, as the women’s rights committee believes. They did not die from discrimination or unequal treatment, they died from dehydration. That brings us to the causes, namely the cumulative effect of collective errors made over the past 20 years. The collective error of ultraliberalism, economism – in the nineteenth century ultraliberalism produced Zola, Victor Hugo, the proletariat and millions of deaths, and ultraliberalism is starting to claim deaths once again. The collective error of ‘human rightsism’, which leaves no place for Lenin among official rights and genuine rights, not to mention the hypocrisy which proclaims rights only to the extent that they are violated. What, then, is to be done? Of course, Mr Barnier, we can announce funding, plans, a new economy and a new hierarchy. The truth, confirmed by statistics, is that not one of those who died came from the middle classes or the great bourgeoisie
. It was those at the bottom of the heap who died. It is just as well that we have banned meatmeal, for otherwise they would have ended up minced in battery pig farms, although it is true that pigs are not abandoned, unlike the elderly people of France.

 Up to now, public budgets have been drawn up on an administrative basis, with the credits being shared out between ministers. There are also, however, methods which show budgets according to major function, according to programme or broken down in economic terms. Since 1995, in the interests of seeking to achieve equality between men and women, it has been proposed that budgets should be drawn up on a sexual basis. This is known as gender budgeting, or budgeting according to sex, which is intended to respond to two questions. The first question is how the budget expenditure should be shared between women and men, in other words who gets the money, and the second question is who should pay, in other words who shoulders the tax burden. This brave vision must be expanded to include even more justice. We need generational budgeting. Which generations pay the taxes? Is it young people, retired people, working people or old people? Which generations gain the most advantage from public expenditure? Above all, however, we must have class budgeting, or category budgeting. Which social categories shoulder the tax burden? Is it the wage earners, or the holders of movable capital incomes? Finally we come to the great taboo, the question of who profits from the budget credits. Is it the rich or the poor? Is it the middle classes, old people, small farmers, the small man or the big man? This is a question about justice. It is a social question rather than a hormonal one.

 Everyone without exception is in favour of labelling foodstuffs containing GMOs in order to inform the consumer and ensure the traceability of these products throughout the production and distribution chain. These measures are mainly a matter of show, however, because it will be difficult for labels, controls and other inspections to prevent the propagation of pollen, the interpenetration of the two food circuits – the one with, and the other without, GMOs – and, finally, the victory of the biotechnologies of the multinational, Monsanto, and of the other giant American seed companies. This Pharisaism on the part of European leaders, who pretend to control the GMO phenomenon – for health reasons as uncertain as the would-be positive contributions of these genetically manipulated products to world agriculture – is made all the more ironic by its timing. Indeed, it was when the French farmers’ leader, José Bové – of symbolic importance throughout the world in alerting people to the real or overestimated dangers of GMOs – was imprisoned at excessive, disproportionate expense that the European Parliament pronounced upon this subject. Labelling for GMOs and imprisonment for those who oppose GMOs. Therein, in short, lies the ambiguity of these biotechnologies and of the European position.

 After salmonella, listeria and other food infections, Northern European health fundamentalists are now directing their attention to the allergies that might be caused by the ingredients present in foodstuffs. Hence, the need for a directive on the labelling of these allergenic additives. Since, however, wine is treated as a food, bottles of wine too would need to be labelled in the name of the right to information concerning the risks of intolerance, particularly to the eggs and fish cited in Annex 3b, which lists the 20 ingredients that present risks. It is true that egg- or fish-based glues are used to eliminate suspensions in wine during production. It is clear, however, that these glues disappear along with the deposits they cause to form in the flocculation process. There is therefore no reason for listing these processing aids on a label since there are no allergens left at the end of the process. Together with the champions of wine growers and of common sense, we have tabled the amendments needed to extricate wine from this phobic and neurotic demand for labelling.

 Madam President, Commissioner, with these two reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele, we are once again looking at GMOs, but through the wrong end of the telescope. We are talking, in effect, about traceability, labelling, zero tolerance, maximum thresholds, freedom of choice for the consumer, health, the environment and precautions. While all this is going on, who is looking at GMOs in Washington? The answer is, President Bush himself, who is urging the European Union to put an end to its moratorium and has even brought the matter before a panel of the World Trade Organization. Likewise, who, in President Bush’s entourage, is looking at GMOs? I can give you a list. There is John Ashcroft, the US Attorney General. His senatorial election campaign in Missouri was partly funded by Monsanto, a GMO multinational. Then there is Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defence, the President of a laboratory that Monsanto bought in 1985. There is Ann Vaneman, US Secretary of Agriculture, a member of the Board of Directors of Calgene, the multinational which created Flower, the first transgenic tomato. There is also Linda Fisher, Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, formerly responsible for the Monsanto lobbying bureau in Washington, and finally there is Clarence Thomas, a judge of the US Supreme Court, who was nominated to his position by Bush Senior and who used to be a lawyer at Monsanto. I could go on; the list is a long one. What does this mean? It means that the Bush administration is treating the GMO issue as a matter of sovereignty, in economic, industrial, scientific and agrifood terms. Just as it did in the case of bananas, hormones in meat, oilseeds, cereals and chickens, the United States is turning GMOs into yet another battle in the transatlantic agriculture wars. Meanwhile, what are we doing? Our legalism is up against their imperialism. Yet the real question, Madam President, is not a scientific one concerning health or the environment. It is the same question as it has been for forty years. Does Europe, with its 450 million inhabitants, want to be independent? In the Persian Gulf, it said ‘no’ while, at the same time, accepting the American war. In the Gulf of Mexico, at Cancun, on 14 September, if it says no it will be an agricultural and tropical Munich, but then Europe is female and loves to be dominated.

Commissioner Fischler, you are very talented, above all in that you have packaged your reform perfectly. You use the phrase ‘mid-term review’ to describe what is actually a mid-term liquidation. Indeed, you justify it with popular, I dare not say populist, clichés: animal welfare, strictly sustainable development, food quality and environmental protection. In reality, the rural development will not be sustainable as young people will not settle in the countryside. As for quality, it will be the quality of global food, and we will align our prices. However, the technical construction of your 2004 CAP is just as skilful. You present it as a new model, thanks to decoupling. Yet, back in 1992, farmers’ incomes were decoupled from agricultural prices, and now you are decoupling direct aid from agricultural production itself. In fact, the long and short of the reform is that you are paying for the sickle and even the bone. How long are you going to pay this direct aid that is decoupled, partially decoupled, modulated, controlled, audited, ‘ecoconditionalised’? That is where you have a great deal of talent, even extraordinary, Machiavellian talent.  The CAP is now 40 years old. Your objective is to make it last for another 10 years, until around 2013-2014, and all the curves stop in 2013. The CAP is only funded until 2012. The milk quotas stop around 2013-2014. In 2012, farmers aged 50 today will, for the most part, be retired. In the meantime, they are safe for 10 years, and if they are safe for 10 years, they are going to be paid for 10 years, quite apart from the young people. They have therefore no reason to protest, and if they do not protest, there will be no unrest in the countryside. If there is no unrest in the countryside, the French, who are the main opponents of the reform, have no reason not to back it. Even the United States, in Cancun, will accept your reform with the Group of Fifteen because it is a reprieve. Moreover, the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure has been removed in the European Constitution itself.. As a result, Parliament will have the last word on agricultural expenditure and there is an ultraliberal majority here. That means that, by 2013, a majority will do away with direct aid, whether decoupled, partially decoupled, modulated or not modulated. European farmers will thus become extinct as they will be operating in a market where US farmers are bombarded with funds.  Commissioner, we will be left with a caricature of agriculture, strictly Austrian in nature. That is why, Commissioner, you are the ideal man, you are the man for the job, you are Sissi the Farmer Empress!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing both enlargement and war. Both these events lead us to examine fundamental questions, such as who we are and what Europe actually represents. Europe represents peace but, with qualified majority voting and enlargement, Europe would have voted for war and, today, German, French and Belgian soldiers would be receiving posthumous decorations. Europe also represents the law, the people’s law, together with Grotius, Vattel, Pufendorf, Molina and Suarèz. Poland, however, is taking part in a war in violation of international law and the Charter. Europe represents, in particular, Emmanuel Kant’s law of nations. The Baltic States, however, which are neighbours of Königsberg, home of the philosophy of the categorical imperative, are failing to respect this law. Lastly, Europe represents memory, the memory of the tanks of the Empire in Budapest (1956) and Prague (1968). Václav Havel and Hungary, however, are supporting the tanks of another empire in Baghdad, which has been turned into a ghetto. Warsaw has forgotten Europe’s memories. Should we, therefore, enlarge the Union to include these governments which have accepted war, rejected the law that forbids it, ignored the moral case which condemns it and forgotten the history of invasion they have experienced? Should we enlarge it to include Turkey, on the borders of Kirkuk which is currently being bombed? That would mean a Europe of adventure with adventurer governments, which, doubtless, is all very well, but these are not the values laid down for us by Article 2 of the Constitution. Enlargement would mean a Europe of lies. That is going too far! Mr President, you are Greek. Apollo’s temple in Delphi bore the inscription: nothing in excess. Ten more countries is excessive.

 The return of AIDS, malaria and even tuberculosis is symptomatic of the poverty caused in certain nations by global free trade and uncontrolled ultraliberalism. These three pandemics have reminded us that the planet is like another Space Shuttle Columbia. When an atypical form of pneumonia breaks out in Vietnam in 2003, death is the result, whether in Hong Kong or in France. This shows that health is a global public good. The problem has been under discussion within the WHO for months. Washington stubbornly refuses to allow poor countries free access to generic medicines. The United States are vetoing intellectual property rights and patents on molecules that save lives. In 2001, however, when they were under threat from anthrax, they considered that the patent on cyclosporine, owned by the Bayer laboratory, should be waived. In other words, the partnership between Europe and the developing countries is clearly a positive but insufficient initiative. The world is suffering from a lack of social imagination. We need to realise that large-scale problems, such as pandemics, immigration or scarcity of drinking water, are global in nature, whereas the solutions can be found at country level. The challenge is to examine the solutions to these problems on a global level in order to prevent them from destroying those who are too short-sighted to think beyond their own country.

Services and, in particular, public services, are the key issue, not only because they represent two-thirds of European GDP, but also because they affect the very heart of the identity of a people and their culture. So should we privatise and commoditise the world’s public goods such as health, literacy, knowledge and water? According to the WTO, the answer is yes. Everything is a commodity. According to the European Commission, the answer is also yes, but a whispered yes, because, ideologically, Brussels subscribes to the philosophy of the ‘libertarians’ who believe in selling everything, even the police, the army and humanitarian affairs, through ECHO. People pretend that they want to preserve cultural diversity. It seems that culture and audio-visual media cannot be treated as commodities, while agriculture, which is the foundation of civilisation, has been in the hands of the market since the Uruguay Round. It has also been said that no liberalisation offer has been made by Europe in the fields of health, education or audio-visual media. However, US intellectual ‘fast food’ chains are already buying a university in Madrid. The audio-visual media of Berlusconi, Bouygues and Murdoch are a commodity. There is also water, which the former Director-General of the IMF, Mr Camdessus, says is a major factor in corruption, particularly in France with Lyonnaise des Eaux
. The confidential nature of the negotiations, the uncertainty regarding the services concerned and the hair-splitting regarding the distinction between globalised trade and nationalised regulation makes GATS an agreement made behind the backs of the people.

 Having opened maritime transport to ultra-liberal competition, with its known consequences: polluted beaches, French fishermen killed by a Norwegian tanker carrying chemicals, piloted by Sri Lankans, the European Commission is now going to deliver port services, from pilotage to dock work, into the hands of private services, in the name of competition between ports, competitiveness and cost reduction, as in the case of the air and rail sectors. The opening of the market, which will apparently be limited to large ports, although we do not know whether that means those handling 3 million tonnes of freight or those handling 45 million, will, for example, include ‘self-handling’. In other words the ship’s crew, who I imagine will be underpaid workers from South-East Asia, a reservoir of new slaves to world capitalism at the service of social dumping, will be able to carry out dock work, all under a flag of convenience. The debate is limited to ascertaining whether concerns for safety will make it possible to exclude pilotage and towage from port ‘privatisation’. That said, our dock workers in Marseilles, Sète and other large ports will be handed over to the pirates of ultra-liberalism. The destruction of port employment will be added to the destruction of fisheries employment. The rebellion and despair of these men in the face of a directive produced by the hawks of economic globalisation is understandable.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two new worrying developments have emerged in connection with the latest round of WTO negotiations. These developments concern the atmosphere of negotiations on the one hand and the subject of negotiations on the other. The atmosphere has changed due to the strong pressure exerted by the United States representatives on their European counterparts. Mr Robert Zoellick has referred to European partners such as France and Ireland as colonialists who are two hundred years behind the times. You are an exception Commissioner, as you have all but been awarded an honorary doctorate by the Bush administration. All this has taken place against the background of references to ‘Old Europe’, or even cheese-eating monkeys. We know that your opposite number Mr Robert Zoellick, signed an open letter from Mr Wolfowitz in January 1998 calling for a war on Iraq. You seem to be negotiating with a hawk Commissioner! You know him better than I do, however, so you must be best placed to judge if he really is one. The subject of negotiations has also changed. To date, we had been discussing subjects which lacked soul. Now, as we discuss agriculture, we are negotiating on quality, the environment, welfare, animals and consequently essentially cultural matters. The present round does not concern goods. It concerns knowledge. It concerns the very essence of people, and their very being. Hence the fear of nothingness, as the Louvain students made clear to you. Agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule. There is its unique structure, the AOCs and the countryside. Hence the deep-rooted fear that you might not stand up for this agricultural exception which goes right back to Mesopotamia. It is nothing new. Serious misgivings abound, and they are mainly of a political nature. We fear that Cancun will be a ‘Munich in the sun’. There are moreover precedents for this. There is the mysterious agreement of 2001 on bananas. Chiquita collapsed just like Enron. There is the failure to challenge the issue of dependency on oil-producing crops, even after the opening-up of former Eastern bloc countries and the consequences of mad cow disease. Above all there is Mr Fischler’s project, begun in July 2002 and confirmed in January 2003, which involved deep cuts in subsidies. At the same time, the United States established proposals to spend 190 billion over ten years from May 2002. Nonetheless, the de minimis
 rule would keep all this within the green box. Our fears are also based on an unfathomable contradiction. Surely it cannot be right to destroy our agricultural infrastructure and know-how when by 2020 there will be two billion more mouths to feed. This is the basis of my fundamental fear. Commissioner, we seem to be already condemned as we speed along on board the shuttle Earth which is as riddled with cracks as the shuttle Columbia. Yet here we are discussing commerce and global free-trade when we know drinking water supplies are dwindling and when two billion people lack electricity or medicine. I am beginning to wonder therefore whether the WTO, like the European Union, is a museum piece.

 Mr President, our fellow MEP, Mr Martin’s, report relates to an issue which is exciting and stimulating not only scientifically but also in economic and social terms and which is, in addition, extremely topical. The Prestige
 disaster in Galicia, where Spain is the leading shellfish farming nation, or Arcachon, where France takes the lead in oyster farming, have shown how very fragile an activity aquaculture in fact is, whether what is at issue is freshwater aquaculture – which our fellow MEP, Mr van Dam, seems to forget about – or marine aquaculture, which is to say not only fish farming but also oyster farming. One really has to be familiar with aquaculture in order to understand it, but it is an activity very closely bound up with the environment, within which it is in extremely subtle states of balance involving more than simply water, currents, chemistry or biology. Remember that, in closed environments such as the coastal lagoons, the Mediterranean or the Etang de Thau, the act of simply painting the boats can disturb the environment. That is why humble fishermen have always been unwittingly engaged in sustainable development. This is not a run–of–the–mill enterprise, but one of the future, entailing dignified, state–of–the art activities involving fish as noble as bass, bream and turbot. With obvious limits of which account has to be taken, it entails great scientific innovations and research into vaccines, genetically modified organisms and diploid or triploid oysters. Certainly, fish are used to feed other fish. The amount of fish meal is therefore greater than the amount of fish produced, and there is a danger of keeping the fish meal industry going. Hence, the need for research. Health problems are those involving not simply antibiotics or bacteria, but mysterious and microscopic algae such as dinophysis. Hence, the need to avoid intensive farming, to keep control of genetically modified organisms, in particular genetically modified salmon, and to have off–shore marine farms, as in Japan. The Bambi or Walt Disney syndrome needs to be avoided, however, with its talk of fishes’ well–being. Otherwise, a halt will have to be called to opening oysters, on the grounds that it is cruel, or to squeezing lemon on them, on the grounds that it causes them suffering. A need exists, therefore, to make it easier for young people to set up in business through training, through investment in purification plant and sandbars, through state–of–the–art scientific research, perhaps even in the form of nanobiology, and through the creation of quality labels (for example, for Arcachon oysters and also for oysters from Bouzigues, which are perhaps better, or from the Etang de Thau). Finally, with ten thousand years of catching up to do on those who work the land, consideration should perhaps be given to cultivating the sea.

 Europe has abolished internal borders. As well as the common market, we have the great Schengen agreement. We can move freely. In exchange for removing all the doors from the 15 apartments in the European building, the 380 million tenants were entitled to have an effective doorman at the common entrance. This doorman at the external borders, however, is not doing his job. In Almeria, Brindisi and, as of June 2004, in Poland, Cyprus and the Baltic States, drugs, pimps, immigration, human trafficking, criminals and terrorists all move freely. Security is no longer guaranteed. The rapporteur asks for radars, satellites, a common monitoring policy, continuous training with a type of ‘Frontalis’, following the ‘Fiscalis’ model of integrated tax control, and naturally the inevitable European body. In this case, a border-control corps, just as others want coastguards. There is even the traditional European agency to heal all woes going by the name of SCIFA+, a body responsible for coordinating border protection. In the meantime, the external borders are like leaky sieves, letting everything through. Which at the end of the day is the only effective solution. Once Europe has been swamped from the East and from the South, it will no longer be necessary to monitor entry through the borders since everyone will already be inside.

 Having brought upon itself severe demographic reductions as serious as during the two world wars, but this time in the name of freedom, fundamental rights and birth control, in other words birth restriction, Europe has now found that its population is ageing. This population now includes the third, and in particular, the fourth age, those over the age of 85, with loss of autonomy, motor and cerebral handicaps and extreme ageing. Furthermore, as the resolution notes that mental illness in the elderly primarily affects women, they have gone from mastering sterility in the 1980s to senile dementia between 2010 and 2020. In the face of this clinical, budgetary, economic and social situation, the rapporteur asks the right questions and then gets bogged down in a mire of vague solutions. The questions are financial. Where will we find the finances, a sum that varies between 4 and 8% of GDP, for the constant care and medical interventions needed by millions of Europeans who have lost their autonomy? The questions are also professional. Where are the specialists in geriatrics, the carers, the specialist care centres, the training required for this segment of the population? The answer to these challenges lies in the new economy of ageing, in inventing a new human planning sector with new diplomas for geriatric assistants and new branches of medicine and associated professions.

 The committee chaired by Mrs Redondo Jiménez is giving farmers a wonderful Christmas present by proposing to put an end to the shameful systematic slaughter of between 6 and 10 million animals struck down by the virus. Reintroducing vaccination, especially since we now have detection tests that are capable of distinguishing serologically between viral infection and immunological response to the vaccine, is the correct solution. There were 320 000 cases of infection in France in 1952 compared to 2 030 at the peak of the UK crisis in 2001. Ten years after vaccination was introduced, there were as few as 148 cases, and 30 years on, only 18. Vaccination is effective and objections based on the cost of vaccinating 300 million animals, like objections from world trade requiring countries to be free from infection, do not hold water. The costs incurred by the epidemic are greater than the costs of vaccination. As for the commercial need, it is extraordinary that this argument should be used when it is internal national consumption that absorbs most of the production. Unless, of course, foot and mouth disease was merely a pretext for getting rid of surplus meat and avoiding storage costs. Not to mention the market sectors opened up for New Zealand sheep, New Zealand being part of the UK-USA alliance of English-speaking countries, of which the US is also a member, and the US has benefited from BSE, which also broke out on the territory of its ally, Britain, which would officially declare that transmission to humans was feasible in 1996, in other words at the peak of the battle between Europe and the US on hormone-treated beef.

 We have the whole of ‘blue Europe’ stretching out before us waiting to be reorganised. The reality of the situation is that fisheries resources are being depleted, whilst the discussion focuses on the reliability of instruments used to measure the extent of the rarity of fish shoals. Our instruments for managing catches, the market, fleets and relations with third countries are criticised by professionals. The Commission wants to act as a substitute for the Council of Ministers in decision-making processes. It persists in its Malthusianism tactics by scrapping boats and even by refusing to fund modernisation. This is how, in addition to jeopardising the safety of fishermen, the problem of unfair competition arises. Whilst we undermine our own industry’s fishing possibilities, other fishermen from third countries are coming in their place. The margin for manoeuvre is, nevertheless, very small. Even aquaculture is not a genuine solution as, in order to ‘manufacture’ one kilo of farmed fish, you need to use between 4 and 7 kg of fish meal. This is the absolute limit of industrial fishing. The potential solutions are acknowledged: regionalisation of management for greater flexibility, more accurate scientific evaluation of resources to avoid disputes, greater involvement of the profession … (Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)

 Small farmers, at least in France, have the highest rate of suicide. This is due to the stress of their uncertain future. The reform of the CAP, however, only increases this uncertainty. After 2006, therefore, will twenty-five States be able to survive on an agricultural budget that was designed for just 15 and has not been changed? After the WTO Summit in Cancun in September 2003, what will become of the internal and export aid criticised by the line adopted in Doha? Granting the European Parliament competence for agricultural codecision and giving this House the final say on the agriculture budget, which stipulates that spending for our small farmers would no longer be mandatory, is placing European farmers in the hands of a majority of our fellow Members who, as we all know, are ultra-liberal, in favour of free trade and against small farmers. We can no longer accept that the future of small farmers should be at the mercy of Anglo-Saxon liberal fundamentalists who are the equivalent of Al Qaida in the crazy religion of trade. Moreover, I am not talking about the uncertainty that will result, in the draft of the new CAP, from decoupling production revenue, modulation or bureaucratic audits. That is why, when so many questions remain unanswered, our small farmers cannot plan their investments and their future. We must not allow our small farmers to be plunged into this abyss.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this 2003 budget is catastrophic, nostalgic and historic all at the same time. Catastrophic, first of all, because it is based on a whole series of things which are unacceptable. For example, the bargain or British cheque. One night, at Fontainebleau – Mrs Thatcher tells this tale in her memoirs – President Mitterrand said to her ‘Madam, you will get your cheque’. In fact, however, since then, the United Kingdom has become a net recipient. It is as if a millionaire continued to go to the soup kitchens and considered that this was actually part of the Community acquis. Second catastrophe: the RALs, for example, not only in the field of the Structural Funds, but also in the field of agriculture. The difference between the budget on which we voted and the appropriations actually committed, actually taken up, is such that, over ten years, European small farmers have lost out on almost the equivalent of an annual budget. This budget is not only catastrophic, however. It is also nostalgic. Everyone has said it, this is the last time there will only be 15 of us. As the Hungarian President rightly said to us earlier, in a Europe with 25 Member States, there is no question of having two speeds, with some countries receiving 100% of the agricultural subsidies and some, initially, only receiving 25%. The balance of political powers will be such that we will not be able to carry on this way. The 2003 budget, however, is an initial response to this need, and that is why it is historic. Not historic because of a number of pretentious things such as the APS – annual political strategy – or ABB – activity based budgeting. These things have existed since the 1960s with the planning, programming, and budgeting system. No, if this budget is historic, it is because it is the first to exceed EUR 100 billion, the first in budgetary history to reach three figures. And although it took 43 years to get there, it will take barely ten years to exceed two hundred and reach the EUR two hundred billion mark. In this respect, sooner or later, these two hundred billion will, of course, force us to establish a European tax. We must welcome this budget, it is the last easy budget, the last simple budget. In future it will be open season on taxpayers, although it is true that, for our British friends, this will replace fox hunting, which has now been outlawed.

 Madam President, Commissioner, at Doha, the fourth WTO ministerial conference had to set an agenda and a programme. It did this, so from that point of view it was a success. Yet for whom was it a success? It was, no doubt, Commissioner, a success for you, since you proved that you enjoy excellent health and the ability to work through the night. Talking of health issues, Doha was a real success as far as medicines are concerned, but it is chiefly due to Osama bin Laden that the poor people of the world owe their entitlement to access to medicines. In other words, if the USA had not been afraid of anthrax and had not, therefore, had to challenge Bayer’s intellectual property rights, they would not have given in. Apart from that, what did we get out of Doha? The answer is, two things, a few clichés and a reprieve. The clichés are piling up. First of all there are those clichés about world trade leading to growth, stability, and of course peace. We had already signed a trade agreement in Marrakesh, and everyone knows that that agreement brought about peace in Gaza and in Palestine, and even peace in Afghanistan. The second great cliché is that Europe would have held out, but was abandoned by Japan. The least developed countries, despite having been given everything except arms, also abandoned it. Korea has maybe stayed with it. The European Union is showing cracks. The French farmers are on their own again, apart from some support from Ireland. However, Europe did obtain a victory on the environment and social affairs. On the environment, the United States, which is not a party to the Kyoto agreement, did not associate itself with us, and on social affairs, all the European trade unions have expressed their highly negative opinions about Doha. In addition, Europe obtained a reprieve. First of all there was the agricultural reprieve. Until the end of the negotiating round, and therefore until 2005, our farmers will have internal aid and restitutions. After that, we agreed that these will be abolished. However, the French representatives Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin called for a stay of execution so that they can get through the presidential elections without any trouble. They obtained that stay of execution for the CAP, which was facing the death penalty, so well, in fact, that when Poland accedes to Europe, Polish farmers will be deceived because they will be joining the Europe of the CAP when in fact, from 2005 onwards, there will no longer be one. We also obtained a reprieve for foreign investments. The IMA was thrown out of the OECD window only to return through the WTO door. We also obtained a reprieve on pensions. The insurance companies will not immediately be able to appropriate this large market for themselves. After Doha, therefore, we are left with the following situation: the European agricultural model has been broken up, the European cultural exception has been forgotten, and the long-term European social model is at risk. What will remain of Europe? It will be merely a vast free-trade area, and everyone knows that, according to Adam Smith, free trade equals national poverty.

Mr President, Commissioner, in this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, there are technical areas of shadow, political certainties and strategic questions. First of all regarding the areas of shadow, how, far from the known endemic sources – Turkey, Asia and Thrace in Europe – how has foot-and-mouth disease, and its virus, managed to reach Great Britain, an island? Perhaps by swimming? Why this dogmatic refusal of a vaccine that is nevertheless effective. In 1950, before the obligatory vaccination between 1961 and 1991, France had up to 300 000 sources of infection per year, which disappeared with the obligatory vaccination. Why, in the same country, have we had the foot-and-mouth virus and the prion for mad cow disease? So many questions that lead to political certainties, if not lessons. In both cases, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the British authorities have reacted late and have been overwhelmed, because the ultra liberalism of the Thatcher years left only 220 vets compared with 8 000 in France. Just as for a developing country, Australia, Canada and even the French army had to send vets to Great Britain. A lack of vets and no epidemic monitoring, which is why the disease spread. It was also ultra liberalism that led to abattoirs being closed and meant that, from Carlisle, Hadrian’s Wall and Northumberland, sheep are taken to the south and the virus is spread. The virus is spread across Great Britain and, following the removal of borders, it is also spread across France. Freedom of movement is freedom of contamination. The third certainty, demonstrated in an investigation report from the French Parliament in June 2001: it was illegal purchases, at knock-down prices – less than 90 euros per sheep for the Muslim feast of Eid-el-Kabir – which led to the spread of the virus. Along with these certainties, however, there are questions for the Commission; and it is good that it should be Mr Lamy, the strategist, who is here. First of all, does the compensation system in Great Britain not end up becoming a bonus for contamination? The impression was given that the beneficial compensation meant that people perhaps had an interest in having contaminated animals. All the more so given that, collectively, four million animals were slaughtered, the majority of which were sheep, means that the surpluses will be drained. And finally, does New Zealand, the leading world exporter, not have an interest in seeing its potential market share in Europe increase as animals are slaughtered? And my God, if Anglo-Saxons were able to come to an understanding on the Echelon Treaty, they can exchange favours. For me, Great Britain, excessive individual compensation, for you, New Zealand, the possibility of more exports. The Cairns group would be happy. Doha would be a success. It would be good if Mr Lamy could clarify this for us.

 Commissioner, without waiting for 2002 and its International Year of Mountains, we twenty Members who are still here all agree that we should protect hill and mountain farming, which is said to represent 20% of our land. I myself come from a region where there are mountains and where transhumance is practised, in our case with flocks of sheep. It really is an ideal form of farming, especially for the European Commission. You have the countryside, forests, biodiversity and the environment, you are preventing soil erosion and producing high-quality products, honey, meat and fruit, you have the tourist industry, and you put the accent on quality of life. Above all, you are not practising productivism, you are not farming intensively, you are not annoying the United States in the world markets in wheat, oilseeds and animal proteins. Basically, hill and mountain farming is multi-functionalism without the quantities. It is the Austrian model that the 2006 reform of the CAP intends to generalise throughout Europe, including the lowland areas. It conjures up a picture of rosy-cheeked milkmaids, accompanied, of course, by Commissioner Fischler, frolicking among haystacks, cow-bells, marmots and alpine pastures, and stroking rare-breed cows, while Mr Bush’s Texans have a monopoly in the meat market. So let us say yes to hill and mountain farming, in the hills and mountains, but no to a European farming industry reduced by WTO negotiations to a series of theme parks with peasants dressed up by Mike Moore to look like Walt Disney characters, whose job would be to entertain Anglo-Saxon tourists and conserve the landscape.

The enlargement process is without doubt a great adventure. Yet up to this point it has been reduced to the rank of a commercial-style takeover bid or a company merger, instead of being a major event in history, reuniting all the Christian peoples of Europe at a time when the secular enemy once again is threatening the south. Within this framework of a camp of freedom and light, pitched against a camp of integrationist obscurantism, Ukraine and Russia, the advanced guard of the West, would have comfortably found their place. The result of this derisory technical fudging of a political issue at the summit is the expression ‘acquis communautaire’. In around thirty chapters, from agriculture to taxation, via the environment, SMEs, education and transport, the laws of the candidate countries, their administrations, their sociologies and even their morals are being closely examined with a police-style scrutiny that must remind these former countries suffused with a proletarian morality of heavy-handed practices that have still not been forgotten. Such states are also seeing their penal codes criticised as an obstacle to their accession, because they forbid certain sexual practices. Many have received lectures on their levels of fraud and corruption, as if European VAT has not been, since 1993, a major factor for serious tax fraud. Malta is even being reproached for attracting too many offshore companies because of its favourable tax laws. As if Ireland has not been guilty of this with the CSFs and as if the United States does not practice this system on an enormous scale; a practice condemned by the World Trade Organisation, but tolerated by Europe that will climb down as many rungs as is necessary in its submission to the empire. At no time has enlargement been the opportunity for a dialogue on experiences and the sharing of success stories. Poland has good reason to point our that its agricultural heritage will be open to a European heritage of 8 million animals slaughtered for foot-and-mouth disease or BSE and 136 000 people incubating the fatal atypical Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Instead of enriching and preserving the heritage of the vegetable and animal biodiversity of these Eastern countries, not to mention their heritage of social relations that have not yet been broken by this ultra-capitalist savagery, the European Commission debases this historic meeting to the level of an unconditional annexation. An Anschluss
, in fact. This explains why the dossier has been entrusted to a German Commissioner and the European Parliament report to a member who is, as if by chance, also German. Things are, it is true, clearer than ever. There is enlargement of course, but as in 1990, it is still German. The 1945 brackets are being closed. The Empire is rebuilding itself. Mitteleuropa
 is here, everlasting in its geography and its history.

 By multiplying free trade areas, abandoning customs duties in a system of generalised unilateral preferences, making gifts of customs duties to the 49 least advanced countries, under the pretext of welcoming everything ‘except weapons’ and above all submitting to the demands of the masters of the empire, from the GATT to the WTO, the European Commission has sawn off the financial branch the European budget used to hang upon – customs duties, which represented over 55% of Community resources in the 1960s, and only represent 14% of them now. In addition, with the abandonment of Community agricultural preference, the common agricultural levy on imports of agricultural products from the Commonwealth, Central America and elsewhere, which protected it, is on the way out. It only produces about 2% of Community resources now. So much so that only 17% of the European budget’s resources now comes from customs duties and that agricultural levy. As these two first historical resources are the only ones specifically belonging to the Community and able to make it financially independent of the Member States, their decline means the Community budget depends on payments from the Member States. That is illustrated by the size of the GNP levy, the fourth historical resource of the European budget, which has only been in existence since 1988. This constantly increasing levy already provides more than 45% of Community resources and in fact boils down to classic contributions by governments to finance an international organisation. We have thus arrived at the astonishing situation where the European Commission, the beating heart of federal integration, has pursued a world customs policy which has reduced the Union to financing itself like any other intergovernmental organisation under entirely intergovernmental international law.

The joint resolution modelled on the report of the European Council held on 15–16 June 2001 in Gothenburg is the combined effort of the green, pink and white liberals and the purple Christian Democrats, i.e. of a syncretic and political majority ranging from Messrs Schröder–Jospin to Messrs Aznar–Chirac, via the Greens, the Joschka Fischers and Dominique Voynets and the ultra-liberals of Alain Madelin. It is like a jumble sale of words, concepts and issues ranging from the death penalty (paragraph 32) to the ‘tax package’ (paragraph 25), via bananas (paragraph 30), Mr Léotard’s diplomatic mission to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has now become FYROM (paragraph 42), not forgetting residually the CAP, development aid, Kyoto, the US tax fraud via the Caribbean tax havens, enlargement and the need for a convention – in unsaid memory of Philadelphia in 1787 – to adopt a European constitution in 2004. But beneath all this apparent jumble of bric-a-brac lie the two key notes of the oligarchic sect that governs us, namely contempt for the people and the quest for an obscure world ‘governance’. The contempt in which the euro-federal oligarchy in Brussels holds the people is reflected in both paragraph 3, with the refusal to respect the clear implications of the Irish referendum, which is analysed as a kind of deadlock from which ‘a way forward’ must be found, and in paragraph 9, where the spontaneous rejection by the people of the excesses of globalisation – from Seattle to Gothenburg, via Prague, Nice, Davos, Washington, Salzburg and perhaps Genoa next – is condemned as ‘provocation’, forgetting that the right to ‘resist’ the economic pressure the global market is exerting on the women and men of Marks [amp] Spencer and Danone, not to mention Moulinex, Michelin, Vilvorde, Alcatel, Ericsson and AOM, is one of the basic freedoms that was established two centuries before the European Charter, which proclaims for the rich alone formal rights that the unemployed, the excluded young and the old and poor do not, for their part, regard as fundamental. Similarly, the nine paragraphs devoted to sustained development – even going so far as a world summit in Johannesburg in 2002 – can scarcely conceal, in the dark recesses of this vague concept that has become a kind of catechism, the quest for a global approach that would miraculously resolve the problems, facing Africa in particular, of under-development, the AIDS epidemic and the economic slavery and poverty so skilfully maintained by the free traders who do not pay the real price for cotton, cocoa, coffee and all the raw materials, i.e. the price of the life of the people whose labour they exploit.

 The European Commission is still clearing up after BSE. Having failed to deal with the root cause of the disease in 1990, which is what Jacques Delors and his gang refused to do so as not to interrupt the triumphant march, firstly towards the single market and then towards the euro, we have since adopted numerous financial and technical stop-gap measures to ward off the never-ending effects of what has been a disaster in health, trade and financial terms. This is the case of the new measure for the COM in beef and veal, which is the subject of Mr Sturdy’s excellent report. In order to save the market which it brought to the brink of collapse, the Commission is going back to its ideological Malthusianism. The special premiums for male cattle and suckler cows would once again be limited to 90 animals or 1.8 LU per hectare. The supply of beef would thus be limited in order to adapt to the drop in demand. Every Member State will set an individual ceiling for each of its farmers. Mr Sturdy is proposing a series of amendments to maintain farmers’ income, particularly for farmers involved in extensive farming. The report recommends, for instance, that the premium for steers be increased, and there are also calls to promote beef and veal by proposing an increase in the current budget of EUR 10 million, which is insufficient. To cap it all, a ‘Special Purchase Scheme’ is proposed for cattle over 30 months old, so that they can be stored and sold off at some point, like the terminally ill who have themselves frozen, in the hope that they can be resuscitated when a cure has been discovered. When we know that public stocks are increasing by 50 000 tonnes each month, that the Commission had already bought back 175 000 tonnes in April and that the beef sector used appropriations worth EUR 7 billion in 2001, you can see the scale of the financial disaster that Jacques Delors’ team made inevitable when it turned its back at the first signs of the BSE crisis. And the new measures proposed by Brussels, which are, moreover, completely ineffective, are seeking to further increase the debt by EUR 1 million. The matter is still not over.

 The Doha summit is approaching and is due to take place in November 2001. After the failure of Seattle, Doha must be a success for the WTO, and if this is to happen, the United States is not to be counted on. Never in history has the hub of an empire conceded its hegemony to its far-flung outposts. The American superpower is giving up none of its claims, especially now it has the Texan, Mr Bush, in office, the man who perpetrated genocide on the children of Iraq. Who, apart from Europe then, can give in? And this is exactly what is happening. First of all, we have reformed the CAP in order to cave in to the demands of the US Administration in the Uruguay Round negotiations. As consensus must be reached at Doha, however, giving in to the United States and the Cairns Group by abandoning our farmers to the productivist and ultraliberal global market is not an adequate approach. We also need the agreement of the poorest African and Asian countries, which also opposed consensus in Seattle. This is the whole point of the new Council regulation, which concedes our customs duties on bananas, sugar and rice for the 48 least developed countries. Between 2006 and 2009, these three products will become entirely duty free. In the meantime, customs duties will be reduced by 20%, 50% and 80% by 2009. Sudan will, therefore, be able to send us its sugar, free from customs barriers, by virtue of the fact that it is a poor country. Sudan is nevertheless able to find the resources to bomb its own villages that stand in the way of its oil wells and is also choosing to starve its inhabitants in the south of the country. The Council regulation, based on the slogan ‘everything but arms’, is therefore, the height of hypocrisy because the additional income that Sudan, for example, will make as a result of the additional exports that we are giving it the opportunity to make, will buy it additional arms with which to fight the Christians in the south of the country. The real problem, however, is the generosity of the socialists and the Christians, as combined in the person of our Commissioner, Pascal Lamy. Christian Europe is offering fundamentalist Sudan, which is of symbolic importance, the financial means to increase the martyrdom of its Christians in the south of the country. This is all the more shocking because the 48 LDCs will act as intermediaries, flooding Europe with bananas, sugar and rice from countries other than those benefiting from a wide range of preferences. A precedent has already been set with garlic from China, for example, which is appearing in Europe via Malaysia, Jordan and other Trojan horse countries. If we understand, however, that European integration is itself nothing more than a Trojan horse, in place to establish the ideological and trading empire centred on the United States, with outposts in every corner of the world, then we see that Mr Miranda has produced the report of a loyal servant of that country’s blueprint for the world.

 Mr President, Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, yes, I said ‘for Consumer Affairs’ and not ‘for Agriculture’, our current concern, the foot-and-mouth crisis, has arrived just in time. Foot-and-mouth disease has arrived just in time for eastward enlargement and for the WTO negotiations. First of all, it is in time for eastward enlargement, since we must, of course, cut our agricultural expenditure because the annual budgetary pie for agriculture will have to be cut into 21 slices instead of 15 and everyone’s piece will, therefore, be smaller unless the number of farmers is reduced. And it has arrived just in time for the WTO negotiations, since we must make room in our marketplace for goods from the southern hemisphere, for goods from the Cairns Group  as we already have for wine, fruit and vegetables – but there is also New Zealand and Australia, which, as if by chance, produce lamb. So, how can we now cut agricultural expenditure for Western Europe and make room in our marketplace for goods from the South? Quite simply by cutting our numbers of farmers and livestock. And how can we cut our numbers of farmers and livestock? Quite simply by making a drama of an everyday occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease, blowing it out of all proportion subjecting it to Apocalypse Now
-type media treatment, turning it into a spectacle, with butchers, mass graves, diggers, bulldozers, cordons sanitaire, the armed forces and mountains of burning sheep, cattle and pigs. For months now, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has been warning of foot-and-mouth disease prevalent in Anatolia, Korea, Japan, in South Africa itself and in Greece last year. The world is on red alert and yet the European Union does not flinch. Foot-and-mouth disease breaks out, and it breaks out, as luck would have it, in Great Britain, which has the most livestock in Europe. What we should do is vaccinate. So, what do we do? We do not vaccinate. And we do not vaccinate firstly because we have to come through this unscathed and vaccination would involve three million pigs, sheep and cows, secondly because this would cost EUR 100 million, and finally because we could no longer export anything  even though we are not exporting anything at all. And so the disease spreads further. And what is the outcome of all this? Farmers aged 55 and over, whose herds have been slaughtered, are forced into retirement. Farmers who suffer unavoidable financial problems due to a fall in sales go out of business. But then, although farmers leave farming, the budget savings that we need can be achieved. Although British herds are haemorrhaging, there is room in the marketplace for lamb from the southern hemisphere and then New Zealand and Australia will, as a result, agree to sign up at the WTO. Eastward enlargement can go ahead, since, in terms of the budget, agricultural expenditure has been slashed. In the wake of the BSE crisis, foot-and-mouth disease has given rise to a total of three miracles. The first miracle is that there are fewer budgetary obstacles standing in the path of eastward enlargement. The second miracle is that the Cairns Group is satisfied with the sacrifice of European livestock and is happy to sign up to the WTO. The third miracle is that we can also reform the CAP at the expense of our farmers, who are made out by the media to be poisoning cows and infecting sheep. All of this happened by chance, of course. It was also by chance that Stephen Dorrell admitted in 1996 that BSE could be passed on to humans, at the exact time when there was the scandal of US hormone-treated beef. It is by chance that we have allowed the disease to spread. It is by chance that, for ten years, we have done nothing to combat BSE. It is by chance that the United States has a stranglehold over the world’s media. So, Mr President, you must appoint Mr Chance European Commissioner alongside Mr Pascal Lamy. Having given up on soya at the Blair House negotiations, he will be successful at the WTO negotiations and next on the list will be the farmers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, after the BSE epidemic it is the turn of foot-and-mouth disease. This is not a coincidence, it is a combination of the ideological errors made in European integration. The first error is the ideology of globalisation, which Mrs Auroi spoke about. The virus arrived from India; it could have arrived from Pakistan; it could have arrived from Zimbabwe. When everything is allowed to move around freely, even the foot-and-mouth virus moves around freely. The second error is the race to achieve profitability. In the name of health precautions, we wanted to have abattoirs which were like laboratories at the Pasteur Institute. Abattoirs were integrated and animals were sent there from the length and breadth of Britain. That is how the virus spread throughout the whole of Britain. The third error is that of immigration. The 20 000 sheep imported into France, which introduced the British virus, were destined to have their throats slit according to the sacrifice of Abraham as part of the Muslim festival of Aïd el Kebir. With the carotid from these sheep we got the virus for free! The fourth error is that of the race for profits. Vaccination was suppressed in the name of Adam Smith and in the name of profitability. And in the name of Adam Smith British trains go off the rails, British cows go off the rails and British sheep go off the rails! So what are we to do in the face of such serious errors? Well, the solutions seem to lie in two directions. The first is that of justice, taking responsibility for compensating innocent farmers. The second is that of moderation: a sense of moderation for animals, who do not need to be slaughtered as they recover after a few weeks; a sense of moderation in the media, who are playing a game of Apocalypse Now; a sense of moderation in terms of health with vaccination, as in Argentina; and a sense of moderation for the European industrial agricultural model, which should achieve greater moderation and balance.

 The European Union cotton consumption stands at more than 4 million tonnes while its production capacity is only approximately 1.5 million tonnes. We therefore have to import the balance. Apparently there is nothing too shocking about this, given that, after all, we already import cars, fruit, vegetables, etc., and so why not cotton too? It would be unbelievable if, given the shortfall in cotton production, the European Commission actually banned further cotton production, but that is in fact the case! There are quotas and penalties in place to limit European cotton production to approximately 1 million tonnes, instead of the 1.5 million tonnes that we are capable of producing. There is a ban on cotton production in Spain and Greece, with hundreds of small farms in Andalusia, Thrace and Valencia. To make matters worse, there are plans to increase the so-called “coresponsibility” levy to more than the current penalty of 50% of the overshoot of the quota. And all this benefits the United States and Australia. In this instance, unlike the case for sugar and rice, it is no longer a matter of sacrificing our own farmers in order to assist the poor in – for instance –the Sudan, a country responsible for exterminating the Christian population of the south. Oh no, there is no such excuse in the case of cotton. It is not like the milk sector, where quotas can be justified due to overproduction. Our sacrifices are not justified in terms of assisting the 48 least developed countries. Europe is blocking production and the only beneficiaries are the United States and Australia. We saw this in the case of oil- and protein-rich crops which we nonetheless need as substitutes for meat meal. We saw this in the case of Californian almonds, and in the case of bananas. Now we have cotton too. What good, then, are the European defence system, the euro, the European Constitution and all the other folderols about the Europe we must have, if Europe is the specific entity which is stopping us producing, however modestly, the cotton we need, so as not to ruffle the feathers of the United States, a country we are also freely allowing to spy on us day and night through the Echelon system.

 Protecting copyright and related rights, which plays a part in the creative process, is in itself a problematic issue. It becomes more critical in the new information society, as it is called – inaccurately, for that matter. The new technologies, symbolised by the Internet, appear to grant absolute freedom, which favours the consumer but prevents creative artists and industries receiving all the due profits from works of art and reproductions. That is why it is difficult to reconcile the divergent interests of consumers, industries and rightholders. How can the profits of the so-called cultural industry be protected without putting an end to the freedom that allows people to collect all the works of arts they find whilst surfing the Internet? For an industry that is making a profit out of information technologies, as they are pompously known, the Brussels proposal for a directive on copyright is a fair compromise. For authors and composers, this compromise weakens copyright protection. For instance, radio broadcast archives would be excluded from protection, as would short-lived reproductions and works of art referred to in libraries or multimedia libraries. Authors are quite rightly demanding fair compensation for the losses they will incur because of the exceptions. In the case of authors, compromise will have to be reached between the three parties by way of contracts. Exceptions to protection would, in fact, be subject to expropriations for which there should be compensation.

 In 2003, Blue Europe, with its common fisheries policy, will be changed. 2001 already marks the end of one of the fisheries management instruments, the MAGP IV, or the Multiannual Guidance Programme. We have two years before 31 December 2002 to consider and make a decision on a common policy which, according to the European Commission’s tally, raises 18 questions, ranging from free access to territorial waters, the control and management of the market in fishery and aquaculture products to international fisheries agreements, scientific research into fish stocks and the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean. The CFP is being reviewed, and even overhauled, against a complex, multi-sided context. Firstly, resources are finite. Stocks such as hake, cod, sardine and tuna, are endangered or at risk. There is wastage. Every year, worldwide, over 15% of fish caught are thrown back into the sea, particularly in the EU, on the pretext of maintaining prices or in order to respect restrictions, whereas countries such as Norway make the most of fish that fall outside the permitted limits. They make up 20 million tonnes of the total global catch of 122 million tonnes. International and regional organisations are also concerned about fisheries management, from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean, to the North West Atlantic fisheries institutions, in which the EC participates. Europe has also passed 25 bilateral agreements with countries including Angola, the Seychelles and Madagascar and is attempting to come to an agreement with Morocco, no mean process and one that is currently in difficulties. More importantly, globalisation, and the associated problem of cheap imports, is now affecting the market. Essentially, the CFP, which often contains too many excessively obscure regulations, must reconcile contradictory objectives, i.e. conserve fish stocks, according to the precautionary principle, while protecting coastal communities and economies which sometimes depend on the fishing industry for employment, as in the case of the Manche region. Similarly, we need a clear CFP that is flexible enough to take into account specific regional characteristics, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and even, as the Italians hope, those of the Adriatic or other sub-regional “seas”. In particular, we must reconcile the major opening up of the European market, importing 60% of consumption, with the need to protect our fishermen, who see the Japanese, American and Korean markets closing. In order to handle such diverse problems, the European Commission has used an effective method that involves extensive consultation of fisheries and environmental organisations as well as producers.

Mr President, we are debating the third agreement with Morocco, which above all concerns French and Portuguese fishermen, who make up the bulk of the fleet, even though a small number of French and Swedish fishermen are also concerned. It is clear that, together with Morocco, Mauritania a little further to the south, and Senegal, we are dealing with some of the richest fishing regions in the world. With the second agreement, things were very clear. Our Moroccan friends and I were in no doubt that this was going to be the final agreement. Now we have reached the moment of truth for all concerned, first of all for Morocco, which has a right to permanent sovereignty over its natural resources. But that is not what I heard just now, when talk was of fishing off the coast of an occupied territory, the Western Sahara in this case, which will be of great assistance to us during the negotiations. The Moroccans have the right to sustainable development and to a major small-scale industry, just as they have the right to create a food industry based on their fisheries and their fish. On the Spanish and Portuguese side, I understand they are invoking a certain historic right. The Spaniards have put forward the case of an established practice and presence, and of an economic and human problem affecting 20 000 people who work in the fisheries and supporting industries. I understand all that. And on the European side, we have the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which is being put to the test. In fact, all our fishing agreements are being called into question not just those with Morocco, as there is also Mauritania and soon there will be Guinea among others to consider. As for our Socialist Members, what a delight! Champions of generosity and of the third world, they are discovering what Chairman Mao called ‘the difference between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions’. They have to reconcile defending jobs with their universalist and globalist convictions, which are being put to the test. It is actually easier to defend the suburbs than it is to defend Morocco. So do we really need a third-generation agreement with mixed enterprises involving a significant return for Morocco and privileged relations? I think we should first of all pay a fair price for the resource. By paying one franc, or less than one euro, for a litre for oil, we have acquired bad habits as far as oil and for that matter, cocoa and the other natural resources are concerned. But we must also understand that nothing lasts forever, not even fish stocks. Morocco is a great nation, but it also has major demographic and economic problems. His Majesty, King Hassan II, is no longer there. Let us add, in conclusion, the problem of their natural and historic province, the Western Sahara, which has not been completely resolved. Today, Morocco is faced with factory ships which are coming to pillage its natural resources, and which the small vessels and small Moroccan industries are in no position to resist. There comes a time in life when we must learn to give in. This must not stop us from protecting our own resources. I am thinking of the tree growers and the market gardeners that we have sold out and also of the interests of southern Europe. To the Spanish and Portuguese Members of the House, I would say that in life everything has to come to an end, even fisheries agreements with the third world.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to embark on a historic vote on a highly symbolic document, namely the European Constitution. Yet it really would be a pity if we voted on a report littered with legal implausibility, with formal trash. That cannot be our legacy to history. I therefore propose, Mr President, that we refer this report back to committee, for cleaning up, so that this historic vote is not polluted by formal inconsistencies.

 Leaving aside the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which, in an ageing Europe, where we will see more than 50 million people aged over 75 in two decades' time, has made no provision for strengthening the right to economic, social and human protection, Biarritz was concerned mainly with axing the number of issues requiring unanimity, the only procedure that can respect the interests of the people, and with the curious invention of closer cooperation, also known as the Europe of circles, the Europe of pioneers, the à la carte
 Europe, vanguard Europe, ‘variable geometry’ or two-speed Europe. From 1951 in Paris, to 1997 in Amsterdam, via 1957 in Rome, what has been going on? Europe was created by Treaties concluded, obviously, between equal states. Moreover, over and above the legal aspect, Europe is a great family of civilisations in emotional terms. We all have the same home. Now, the idea of closer cooperation means that in crucial areas, such as money, defence and taxation, some members of the European family would have more rights and obligations than others. In other words, among those sitting round the table of the common European home, some would eat à la carte
 while others would get the dish of the day. Some would have a say about money while others, like Denmark or Sweden, would have to hold their tongue. As we saw before the existence of total, universal suffrage, there would be active “peoples” and observer “peoples”. There would, in a sense, be “males” with the right to talk war, taxes and money and, as in pre-1945 France, “females” sitting round the table with no right to decide. Moreover, in this ‘variable-geometry’ Europe, the number of guests with the right to eat à la carte
 would vary depending on the subject under discussion in the European Council of Ministers and this state of affairs would create further complexity in a Europe whose way of operating is already quite obscure. In other words, the philosopher's stone of closer cooperation, which would allow the rule of unanimity and the right of veto, which protects national interests, to be circumvented on the sly, would achieve the amazing feat of violating the principle of equality between states, excluding minority nations from key issues, thus opening up cracks in the democratic foundations of European integration, making the European institutions even less transparent and spreading confusion, if not disarray, within the Council and the Commission. Once again, the technocratic smokescreen and verbal fog are conceal machinations intended to foist on the peoples a military and fiscal Europe that they do not want and to deprive them of their right to say no to the loss of their national freedoms.

 The rather bureaucratic term ‘outermost regions’ encompasses women and men from New Caledonia, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Reunion, Mayotte, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and all our territories in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic, which form a bridge of intelligence, solidarity and beauty between Europe and other continents and other civilisations. The Europe of Brussels, with its mania for levelling out and standardising, has acted unfairly and even stupidly towards our compatriots who live according to European values thousands of kilometres away from Paris, Madrid or Lisbon. The technocrats, the European judges, wanted to abolish the ‘dock dues’, which provide resources for our municipalities in the French overseas departments and, in particular, protect our traditional workforce. From this distance, Brussels has put our Martinique rums, our rice and our tropical fruits at risk. Most especially, this has resulted in the planned destruction of our banana industry, in Guadeloupe, Martinique, Madeira and the Canaries. The European Commission has kow-towed to the banana multinationals. Every year, EUR 2 billion in customs duties are given away to Chiquita and Del Monte. How then can we refuse to give our remote departments and territories the funding they need to make up for the costs involved in transportation, dealing with cyclones and investing in universities or hospitals? When our regions, in the West Indies for example, or the Pacific, are tax havens used by the American multinationals, from Kodak to Microsoft, Boeing or Cargill, for massive tax-fraud exports, then the right to geographically equal competition, together with the right of all Europeans to equality, requires that we devote part of the European budget, in which taxes make up 17% of revenue, to developing the economic, social and cultural life of our compatriots who live in regions that may well be outermost in terms of geography but are central in terms of civilisation.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the market organisation in wine and olive oil we now have the market organisation in fruit and vegetables, which is also of concern to the southern countries. In fact, the majority of speakers have been Spanish. Our friend and colleague, Mr Jové Peres, has produced an excellent report, which deals with a subject that is both extremely serious and extremely symbolic. It is serious not only because of the numbers involved – almost two million families, or 500 000 jobs are, as we have already heard, affected – but also because, behind the failure of the 1996 reform, there are nevertheless women, men and rural regions which, Mr Fischler, the European Commission has deliberately condemned. In France, in Provence to be exact, for a holding of 40 hectares of apples, production costs are twice the sales price, which means that a holding producing 40 000 apples loses EUR 320 000 per hectare per annum. This holding will disappear. To whom shall we apportion the blame? It is not the fault of the tree growers; they have tried to form producer organisations and to build up part-financed operational funds. But in order to do this they need to have revenue and in order to have revenue they must sell. But they do not manage to sell because the powerful purchasing and distribution groups buy outside Europe – obtaining pears from Argentina and apples from Chile, New Zealand and South Africa. Supplies are acquired from these countries because they are cheaper, because workers in the southern Mediterranean or the Pacific have no social protection, because customs duties have been abolished, and because the European Commission is suffering from mad diplomacy disease, that is, the disease of global free exchange! In the name of a global foreign policy, Brussels has sacrificed our tree growers, our market gardeners and our horticulturists, who have become a currency of exchange in the free exchange culture. The deal is well known: fruit and vegetables, flowers and wine in the southern hemisphere and, perhaps, industry in the north. So, in the words of Comrade Lenin, ‘what is to be done?’. Obviously we must adopt the excellent relief amendments put forward by Mr Jové Peres, who has produced an outstanding report, and those of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, without the pretext of budgetary neutrality. There is no lack of money to throw at Kosovo, at the Balkans, at Indonesia and at Asia. But if we do not put an end to the global drift in European integration, little by little not only will the farmers disappear, but the whole of Europe will drown in the ocean of the global market.

Madam President, I speak with regard to Item 14 of the Minutes on the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira’s parliamentary immunity. We opposed this waiver, Madam President, which answers the question that you were just asking, in the name – to quote from Paragraph D of Mr MacCormick’s report – in the name of the “independent nature of European parliamentary immunity compared with national parliamentary immunity”. I would remind you that the Greek word for such independence would be ‘auto nomoi’, which means ‘having its own laws’, and as the rapporteur says “its own rules”. It follows that, if the Parliament has its own rules concerning the waiver of parliamentary immunity and if its discretion is not limited when the national authority requires that immunity be waived, then it is even more true that, this being so much more minor an issue, it also has its own rules when it is required to terminate a Member of Parliament’s mandate. It has its own laws, its ‘autonomy’, it has discretionary powers and its discretion is not limited. Yesterday, Madam President, you had discretionary powers, as did Parliament, and there were no limits on this discretionary power. That was the legal error on your part, Madam President.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has very real problems, such as poverty, unemployment, taxation, and lack of security, yet what is proposed instead of addressing these issues? A constitution! That is strange enough in itself, but what will this constitution bring? In its form, so much hot air! In its content, nothing but jiggery-pokery! As to the results it will achieve, a disappearing trick! The hot air as regards the form is to be found, for example in paragraph 11 of the French version of the Duhamel report, a constitution against, I quote, “a backward step” going backwards. But a backward step is always backwards! Paragraph 20 speaks of a constitution to discuss, and I quote, “their shared future together”. But if this future is shared, then obviously they are together. Paragraph 8 states that the constitution will deal with, and I quote, the “issues not settled”. Well, outstanding accounts may be described as ‘not settled’, and there may be answers outstanding, but not issues. According to paragraph 4, we need a constitution because the Treaties are “unreadable and invisible”. If it is unreadable, people must have attempted to read it, so it cannot be invisible, and so forth. What is so serious about Mr Tautology’s report is the fact that he is proposing a constitution based on jiggery-pokery. First our nations are abused by this sort of constitutional rapist fiddling with their equality. In the enhanced European house, some nations will be sitting at the military, monetary, and possibly tax, tables, and others will be left out. In an à la carte
 Europe, we will then have some nations eating from the set menu. That is why reinforced cooperation means reinforced exclusion. As nations cannot withstand this attack on their equality, democracy is being abused. Paragraph 8 of the constitutional resolution states that Europe’s constitution must be adopted, and I quote, “with no risk of the process being blocked” and, as paragraph 7 of the Duhamel report says, “without a referendum” there can be no democracy. And that is where the jiggery-pokery becomes abuse. The rule of unanimity with the sanction of a veto, if required, is the last bastion protecting the smaller nations and sovereignty. Because it proved impossible to simply do away with the rule of unanimity, it is being sidestepped by means of reinforced cooperation, which is nothing more than the abuse of sovereignty. Who stands to benefit from this? The unemployed? Pensioners on EUR 700 a month? Street children? The Palestinian children of European society? No, it will be the elite that profits from this, the caste which goes by the name of Olivier, Pierre, Dany, all their fathers’ sons, the oligarchy. That is why men and women prefer Zidane and Schumacher, because at least with Zidane, they have the dream of breaking out of the social Palestine in which you imprison them, whereas, with Prodi, the prospect every morning, every evening and every day is gloomy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our budget for 2001, with its EUR 92.5 billion in payment appropriations adds two new items to the traditional features. As far as new features are concerned, in the first place, it is the first time the budget has been presented in functional terms, classed by programme and not just according to administrative divisions, with 19 policies covering 200 activities, which is the system currently used in most countries. France is currently carrying out reforms to this end. The second new feature is the shift in the battleground the budget war is waged on. What we have had so far is a war over compulsory or non-compulsory expenditure or over the maximum rate of increase. Now the war between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the two budgetary authorities, is tending to shift towards the revision of the financial perspective, which has, in fact, been revised 38 times since the Delors package, and towards a battle over category 4, i.e. external action. As regards the traditional features, apart from the problems of ensuring that the projections are honest ones, we have, first of all, the problem of budgetary cuts for European farmers, with EUR 300 million of agricultural aid and EUR 225 million of appropriations for rural development cut. There is nothing for beekeepers, who were asking for a mere EUR 15 million, even though it is possible to increase expenditure for the Balkans by 30%. The second traditional feature is the way ideological allies are fêted. We have the whole kit and caboodle of subsidies for associations working with drugs, xenophobia, immigrants, the Jean Monnet House, the exile council, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, even the PRINCE campaign. EUR 38 million are being cast away on the campaign on the euro. Finally, the third traditional feature is the budgetary funds poured into foreign preferences. There are poor people in Europe too, even if only retired farm workers. It is shocking to see Mr Wurtz and Mr Fodé proposing amendments to give appropriations to Chile, Australia, South Africa. Charity begins everywhere except at home. We are even throwing EUR 250 000 away for the WTO ‘world parliament’. I hope, Mr President, and this is my concluding remark, that we are at least going to cut the EUR 50 million budget lines financing the Israel-PLO peace agreement. I hope that not one single euro will go to the Israeli army so that they can buy bullets to kill Palestinian youths on their own soil.

 Just because, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are supposed to be discussing the order of business does not mean that we have to take orders as to our business. A number of Members of Parliament have had a fantastic dream, this I can understand. They have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by Chairman Spinelli, for instance, or turning our Treaties into a constitution. Well, today, acknowledging that the jurisdiction of the European Parliament is subject to a State, regardless of which one this is, and has a bounden duty to terminate the mandate of one of our fellow Members, would be to admit that Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and must yield to national legal or government authorities. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream, one I do not, however, personally share. Simply by acknowledging that the European Parliament has the discretionary power to settle the matter of the termination of the mandate, you will have gone some way towards achieving your federal dream. Otherwise, Madam President, in yielding to the authority of others, you are effectively taking a step backwards.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the issue of the composition of feedingstuffs for animals, if we are to eliminate mercury, lead, arsenic, DDT, etc., we must address the question of the way in which these products are marketed. This is, of course, all due to the BSE tragedy that turned into a real saga, with several episodes. Mr Böge dealt with the episode of the committee of inquiry in 1997, there was the episode of the ban on British beef, the episode of the labelling of meat and now we have the episode of labelling animal feedingstuffs. Of course, farmers have the right to know what their cows are eating and the right to know whether their pigs are eating car sump oil, which contains dioxins. Food must therefore be labelled to show the precise contents. This is a simple thing, but for ten years, we have sat and twiddled our thumbs. Admittedly, there are labels that tell half the truth, stating “contains oil”, but that could mean fish oil, vegetable oil, tallow or grease. Common sense, as our rapporteur said, would suggest that labelling should make a clean sweep and list all the ingredients. On this issue, however, we have been told that the intellectual property of manufacturers’ formulas must be protected, that monitoring compliance would be difficult, that the label would be covered with the list of nutritional values and raw ingredients and that the contents would vary according to the market in which they were sold. In short, then, people have tried to win some time. Today, we have found a good solution, although nothing has been said about animal feedingstuffs containing GMOs, such as soya flour. Nor has anything been said about the responsibility of manufacturers, particularly in Britain, who were primarily responsible. Even if we are pleased with this progress, however, how can we forget that before we finally adopted measures it took ten years and 80 deaths, and in two years’ time we may well yet discover a zoonosis, a health disaster? I do not know, Mr Byrne, if the European Commission is at risk of dying from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, but given the slow pace of your lives, I can take pleasure in the fact that you will surely not die of a heart attack.

 The enlargement of the European Union to include the ten countries of Eastern Europe plus Malta and Cyprus is a great project. For indeed, who could deny entry into the European House to States such as the Poland of Copernicus and John Paul II, the Hungary bullied in Budapest in 1956 or the capital that has become a symbol, Prague, when popular democracies threw the Head of State out of the window and crushed the nation of Jan Palach, sacrificed in the name of freedom. It is, however, precisely because of this harrowing past that our affection for our European brothers in the East, might induce in us some unease at seeing them, having just emerged from the bureaucratic totalitarianism of the Soviet Empire, fall into the clutches of another form of totalitarianism, just as bureaucratic, that of the free trade empire of untrammelled ultraliberalism. Is it really in the interest of farmers in Poland or Hungary to condemn themselves to becoming redundant within two decades of entering the Union? Is it really in the interest of the Greek Cypriots, who, like their fellow countrymen in Thrace, have known for more than a century what Turkey signifies, to become members of a European Union which will tomorrow allow their former torturers to travel freely and reside freely in their land? This is why I and my fellow Members of the European Parliament from the Front National
 would like to spare the nations of Eastern Europe the mistake of being ‘disintegrated’ within the American-European Union. Everyone has free will, however. We are warning them, as friends. We shall welcome them, as friends. As friends, however, we are too dubious about the wisdom of their decision not to refrain from putting them on their guard.

 Mr President, my Group and I identify as victims of discrimination, on the grounds of our beliefs, in this very House, since we are prevented from forming a political group as everyone else is authorised to do, and we therefore wholeheartedly applaud the opportunity to set up a programme to combat any form of discrimination. Not just discrimination against men and women at work. In France, for example, men are not allowed to teach in primary education. That is a case of blatant discrimination. The question is, however, far more significant in philosophical, legal and sociological terms. Legally speaking, there are general texts condemning discrimination everywhere. Yesterday, for example, the Charter of Fundamental Rights condemned discrimination, not just racial discrimination but even, according to the Charter, discrimination on the basis of birth. In affirming the principle of equality, all the constitutions of the world virtually establish a principle of constitutional jus cogens
, since discrimination is prohibited everywhere. On the other hand, however, for forty years there have been texts in existence which are actually based on discrimination. In Geneva in 1963, the first of these, UNCTAD, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, established the principle of compensatory inequalities or, in other words, discrimination. Our own Lomé Convention itself is based on discrimination in favour of the Caribbean and Pacific States. Our entire dispute with the United States, moreover, has arisen because we wanted positive discrimination in favour of our own ACP banana producers whereas the United States wanted an egalitarian system which would serve the interests of multinationals. Europe itself, with the GSP, the System of Generalised Preferences, which leads us unilaterally to give up our customs duties to the benefit of a whole series of States, is based on discrimination. And the national laws in our 15 countries also practice discrimination, including the Socialist France of the Socialist Mr Jospin. In 1999, with regard to New Caledonia, a preference was established with regard to employment on the basis of ethnicity, on the basis of race. So New Caledonia operates a preference based on skin colour. In the urban suburbs of French cities, there are tax free zones, based on ethnicity once again, for these areas are dominated by specific ethnic populations. And that is without mentioning the United States where, thirty years ago, the Supreme Court invented the principle of ‘affirmative action’. On a sociological basis, moreover, there is discrimination according to birth. In this House, Mrs Ana de Palacio Vallelersundi has a sister who is a Commissioner in the European Commission. If she were not born Ana de Palacio Vallelersundi, do you think the two sisters would now be in these two places? Not everyone in the Olympic Games gets through to the final. There is no right entitling a person to go to the Olympic Games. So, in sociological terms, there is the risk of abuse. The principle of non-discrimination is a fine one, Mr President, but it also has a flip side. I must therefore warn you, the situation is not as simple as you may imagine. This principle of ….

 Mr President, Mr Prodi, Mr Moscovici, it is precisely the Charter of Fundamental Rights that will, at Biarritz, provide the solutions to institutional problems. Granted, this text may seem commonplace at first sight, but it takes on great meaning in the light of topical events. The protection of human dignity and liberty, cited in the preamble, would resonate loudly in Palestine, for example. And in Article 21, it may seem like verbiage, especially in our 15 Member States, to worry about discrimination on the grounds of religion or ethnic origin, when elsewhere twelve-year-old boys are being shot like so much vermin precisely because of their religion. It could even be seen as insulting to these adolescents, who actually face discrimination and death. We need a sense of perspective, a sense of the proportionality set out in Article 48 of the Charter, before voicing off from our own standpoint as relatively well off in human rights terms. It is, moreover, this sense of perspective that will provide the solutions at Nice, since it will at last be possible to enlarge the Union to include, for example, the Poland of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II or, at a later date, orthodox Russia, the eastern sentinel of the Christian world, and it will be possible to do so without disrupting operating procedures. All we need do is apply the philosophical principles set out in the Charter. Therefore, in the name of the respect for national identities set out in the preamble, there must be a Council of Ministers which unanimously agrees with the fundamental freedom of nations. In the name of respect for the equality of all men, living together as a State, there must be at least one Commissioner per Member State and, lastly, in the name of prohibiting the types of discrimination set out in Article 21 of the Charter, there must be no two- or three-speed Union, because all the members of the same family living in the house called Europe must move into the future together without leaving anyone behind. That is what the Charter stipulates. Let us not violate it before it is even applied.

 National accounts are magical. With a few aggregates, GDP, GNP, consumption, income, capital formation, etc. They provide a small-scale model of the economic life of a country, making it possible to calculate tax pressures and the percentages of public deficit or indebtedness. This is to say that it is a major instrument in managing economic, budgetary and fiscal policy. It is the means by which the Maastricht criteria find application, and by which, above all, the European Community identifies the VAT own resource and especially its fourth resource based on GNP. It is, however, essential for the procedures for drawing up these national accounts, both in the transactions described and the institutional sectors summarised, to be identical from one country to the next. Otherwise, quite obviously, it is not possible to make a comparison. Hence the need for common principles for recording taxes and social contributions within the Fifteen. That, in a nutshell, is the subject of the Regulation being discussed here. It standardises the mechanisms of the integrated economic accounts within the European system of national and regional accounts. This European System of Integrated Economic Accounts, which dates back to 1970, was amended again in 1995. A great many problems arise. Should one assess revenue, for example, on the basis of the taxable event or on collection of the tax? It is known that in France, for instance, the figure for tax receipts varies according to whether you use the statistics of the Direction générale de la comptabilité publique
 or those of the Comptabilité nationale
. It is therefore all the easier to imagine the possible variation from one country to the next. Especially since it is in States’ interest to ‘cheat’ and understate their basic taxable amount for VAT or the GNP levy. Indeed, the reports of the European Court of Auditors continually comment on understating of this type, from Greece to Portugal. In the case in point, the amendment of the 1996 Council Regulation before us, the Commission proposes to register taxes and contributions by taking account primarily of the revenue actually collected, rather than the tax calculated as due on the basis of the taxable event. The Commission also proposes to apply a coefficient to the ‘non collectable’ percentage in order to avoid understating the true level of deficit, compared with the Maastricht requirements. While it all seems purely to do with technical matters, there are nonetheless considerable political implications.

 At a summit in Davos, Zbigniev Brzezinski, President Carter’s adviser, spoke about the need to use sport, show business and entertainment as a pressure valve for the millions of marginalised people that unrestrained free trade produces every year in a general free market economy. A word was even coined for this new version of ‘bread and circus’. It is ‘tittytainment’, formed from the American slang for breasts and the word entertainment. The lesson was learned and the idea of sport as an entertainment, as an industry and as the opium of the impoverished masses of the world, took off. There is an endless succession of world cups, European cup finals, Grand Prix competitions, the Olympics of Helsinki and Sydney, football, tennis, races, car rallies and horse races. All this is done in the name of the social function of sport, which produces healthy minds in healthy bodies, to the point that the Treaty of Amsterdam now includes a declaration on sport emphasising “its role in forging identity and bringing people together”. Indeed, we all know that, thanks to sport and to the Olympic Games, the Peloponnesian War never happened, that Athens and Sparta truly loved one another and that the circus brought the gladiators together. From the evidence of the Heysel stadium, with its death toll, to the British hooligans at the UEFA Cup in Copenhagen and elsewhere, not forgetting the case of Nivel, the French policeman murdered by German supporters, let alone the Turkish ‘tourists’, the French PSG and others, it is quite obvious that sport makes people more sociable, tolerant and cooperative and fosters all those other qualities which have been promoted so well by the French suburbs and inner cities, since the World Cup, through the festive bonfires created by setting fire to cars. Nor did high-level sport produce dozens of cases of rape and sexual attacks in the Olympic village in Atlanta; and French tennis champion, Nathalie Tauziat, who wrote a book criticising the very emotionally charged atmosphere behind the scenes of the tennis courts, was obviously eliminated from the French team selection in Sydney in the name of the team spirit and significant social values fostered by sport, according to Mr Mennea, the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. Once this balm and these nice sentiments have been applied to the galling wounds of real life, our rapporteur becomes well aware that sport is not a cultural phenomenon but a political and strategic instrument used to enslave the citizen, who is made to forget the loss of his civic powers through a form of televisual training developing age-old instincts. Share-capital companies, sports-club factories, from Manchester United to AC Milan, not to mention the US basketball and golf circuits, doping, the industry of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, which have left Pankov’s Germany and the Soviet Union to spread throughout the world, Adidas, Nike and other sponsors who want to see results, transfers to the tune of dollars beyond our wildest dreams, the EU Court of Justice’s judgments, including the famous 1995 Bosman judgment that everyone criticised but that ensures the free movement of young sportsmen and women and sports merchandise, the huge commercialisation, the alleged re-broadcasting rights and the collusion between sport and business – that is the real face of the industrialised world of sport that comes under our Community legislation. It is from that manipulated world that we must protect real sport, the amateur sport practised in thousands of clubs, which have limited resources and survive thanks only to the devotion, ability and generosity of a huge number of voluntary workers. That is where we must put our public funding, instead of investing it for the benefit of the tin gods of world stadiums.

Europe is going to expand eastwards. This is written in Agenda 2000. But Europe has a fluid border to the south, conditioned by its geography. Boats and rafts arrive along its borders in southern Italy and southern Spain. They are loaded and sometimes overloaded with Albanians, Turks, Muslims – men, women and children from all the countries around the Mediterranean. It is a tidal wave that is going to grow year by year. Europe is going to be submerged, even though at El Elejido in 1999 and in just a few other places, the settled populations have reacted against this flood of nomads. Not wanting any roll back and unable to achieve containment, European leaders are logically seeking to prevent these nomads from leaving their home countries. And this is the aim of the common-sense MEDA programme. Sketched out at the European Summit in Cannes in June 1995, established by the Barcelona Conference of November 1995 in the form of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership, and implemented by the MEDA Regulation of 23 July 1996, this Mediterranean policy of the European Union is based on a few regional and national investment projects. It is a meagre amount: EUR 3.3 billion from 1995 to 1999, from Morocco to Gaza and the West Bank, even if, by adding to it the EUR 3.6 million in loans from the European Investment Bank, the financial contribution is greater than the EUR 4.4 billion given by the World Bank. It is a meagre amount, not only because, in reality, these EUR 3.6 billion in commitment loans are in fact reduced to a collective payment of just EUR 648 million, but also because this step is not commensurate with the size of the problem. Admittedly, it is good to have moved from bilateral aid to a global, multilateral approach. Admittedly, for 2000-2006, MEDA II will increase loans of less than 47.1% to arrive at a financial package of EUR 8.5 billion. European farmers would be happy with an increase that was twice, three times less than that. But that does not constitute a Mediterranean policy. A Mediterranean policy is not more programmes and more officials in Brussels to manage them. A Mediterranean policy that is up to the demographic, environmental, climatic, Islamic and cultural challenge is a grand strategic vision, establishing, integrating, stabilising and organising the Mediterranean around original and intergovernmental institutions with major common sectors to explore: water, the environment, migration, deforestation and so on. Under these conditions, and with a method and integrated institutions such as a High Secretariat for the Mediterranean, one can talk of a budget, as there will be strategic projects and not tactical sprinklings of small amounts. But we must act quickly, very quickly, before a colonised Europe has nothing more to share than the decline of peoples who have been deprived of their culture.

The United States is spying on us, using a network of satellites, aerials and super-computers, via ‘Anglo-Saxon’ relay states such as Australia, New Zealand and even Great Britain, one of the Fifteen, one of the Member States of the European Union, which allows its territory and Gibraltar to be used so that the 14 other Member States can be spied on, despite the principle of Community loyalty. It has been established from and confirmed by numerous sources that this wholesale bugging of all telephone signals has had considerable economic and commercial repercussions, to the detriment of European companies such as Alcatel or Airbus, which have lost huge contracts to American multinationals privy to privileged information obtained fraudulently and illegally. Conditions of fair international commerce, with fair competition, have therefore been damaged, while within the WTO, on agricultural procedures, for example, the United States continually accuses Europe of undermining healthy international competition by granting aid, income support, export subsidies and certain production subsidies. This state of affairs cannot simply be ignored by the Commission, by the Council of Ministers or by Parliament, which is always anxious to apply the principle of precaution which, in this case, would allow us to protect Europe's economic health and its financial interests. How are we to explain this curious conduct, with 15 States agreeing to be spied on, 20 Commissioners agreeing to be spied on and a huge majority of the 626 members of the European Parliament, who are always calling for more transparency from the Council, still agreeing to cloud the issue of this American Echelon network which is spying on us? How is it that all the European institutions and the people in them agree to what, under the laws of the 15 Member States, constitutes a serious criminal offence, in the narrow sense of the word, and is liable to punishment as such? Instead of which, what threats and what pressure have persuaded several hundred European decision-makers, ministers, Commissioners and Members of Parliament to become accessories to the crime of espionage and undermine state security? This question is fundamental because it conditions the very raison d'être
 of the European structure. Why, in fact, are we constructing Europe? To be stronger, more independent, richer? Obviously, the answer is yes. Then why accept the Echelon system, which makes us dependent and poorer as the result of lost contracts? Anyone can see that this is where the ambiguity of the European construction lies. And we, the French members of the Front National, the Flemish members of the Vlaams Blok and the Italian members of the MSE, are alone in defending the need for a committee of inquiry into this global spy system. We must defend the true Europe, the truly European Europe!

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, having done so on 16 December 1999, we are addressing the problem of identifying cattle and the problem of labelling. And all because, for the past 14 years and, officially, for the past 4 years, there has been a zoonosis, i.e. a disease which can be transmitted from cows, in this case British cows, to humans. Not knowing how to cure this disease and not having had the will to prevent it when we could have done so from 1989 onwards, we are now reduced to bidding to reassure the consumer. Just as the Americans invented happy pills in the 1950s, we have invented consumer sedatives, i.e. labels. As soon as consumers are worried, anxious or afraid, we give them a label. We put labels on tobacco for them, we put labels on chocolate for them, and when they are upset because they no longer have any cocoa, we put labels on GMOs for them, not that this prevents genetically engineered soya, cotton and tomatoes from arriving by the boatload. We put labels on wine for them, not that this prevents bogus port from South Africa from landing in our ports and, finally, we put labels on beef for them! I must admit, Commissioner Fischler, that you have slammed on all the brakes – if I may put it thus – both skilfully and in bad faith in order to delay labelling. But unable to delay it all the time, you decided to drown it and the draft regulation has overloaded the label to the point at which it is illegible. You have even arranged to add the approval numbers of the slaughterhouse and cutting plant, all of which is incomprehensible to the consumer, of course, who does not have the equipment to read the barcode. And in the case of kebabs, stews, sautés and ready meals, pieces of meat may come from the whole of France or the whole of Europe. So with a calf born in France, fattened in Italy and slaughtered in Ireland, the label will be a real geography lesson! As a result, the meat wholesalers, the SMEs referred to by Mr Souchet, have denounced the increased costs and, at the same time, compulsory labelling has given us an insight into the curiosities of the meat market: 40% of beef derives from animals which have done the rounds of Europe; when you buy a steak at the butcher's, little do you know that it has travelled 3000 kilometres, taking in 4 countries on the way: the country in which it was born, the country in which it was raised, the country in which it was slaughtered and the country in which it is consumed. In my country, 1.5 million animals a year take a trip via Italy and Spain. So in that case, what do you put on the label? The whole itinerary? Or just ‘Origin: European Union’? But if we put ‘Origin: European Union’, that conceals the fact that the meat may derive from an English cow, riddled from top to bottom with a prion courtesy of their gracious ultraliberal majesties, Adam Smith and David Ricardo. So, today, we are offered a compromise. We are told that labels will state the origin of the animal and the category: is it a calf, a heifer, a cow or a bull? But what we want is a compromise which will make life easier for SMEs, for small companies, not that any of this need prevent us, Commissioner, fellow members, from taking brief stock. It all started with milk quotas back in 1984. In order to increase their yield, the British stuffed their cows with bonemeal. To save money, they lowered the cooking temperature of the bonemeal and the prion survived and contaminated their cattle. Without free movement, it would have stopped there, but with no frontiers, they contaminated Portuguese and French cattle and we have known about it, even here, since 1986. José Happart, a Socialist, and I have been warning of the risk of a zoonosis since 1989. But the Maastricht Treaty had to be ratified, so nothing was said and the truth was hidden. A committee of inquiry chaired by Mr Böge was set up, but the Amsterdam Treaty had to be ratified and nothing was said. The Commission was not held to account, Mr Fischler, and for 14 years, nothing was done. When five German Länder wanted to protect their consumers, you instituted infringement proceedings against them. The moral of this tale, quite apart from the labelling saga, is that it is the nation states that have protected their consumers. For its part, the Commission has protected free movement. Real subsidiarity means ensuring that consumers, with the help of their country, can each protect themselves. The label only comes along when the fork is poised; but the best solution would be to label when the pitchfork is poised. The intermediate solution lies between fork and pitchfork, i.e. at the frontier, the only place where animals can be protected against unreasonable transport and consumers can be protected.

 Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, we spent this morning discussing institutional affairs with President Jacques Chirac and this afternoon discussing budgetary matters which really amounts to one and the same thing. Firstly, the budget with its EUR 93 million in payment appropriations represents a 5% increase, whereas national budgets are subject to greater austerity. However, the European agricultural budget is also experiencing a period of austerity, even though outwardly it appears to have grown by 7%. Agricultural revenue has dropped and so this 7% is a mere illusion; we have simply moved from a price support policy to an income support policy. We are witnessing the continued, and wholly scandalous, misappropriation of EUR 300 million of agricultural funds for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as though the Balkans formed part of the CAP! The CAP is being drastically cut back to the advantage of the CFSP and, as you will see, this is being carried out with no modification to the Treaties. We are here as part of a consultation procedure that the Treaties do not provide for and we are operating within the framework of an Interinstitutional Agreement of May 1999 that the Treaties do not provide for either. Over the past 20 years, non-essential expenditure has increased from 5% to more than 45% of the total budget expenditure without any modification to the Treaties. We have carried out an institutional revolution, to Parliament’s advantage, without an IGC. Does this mean that the institutions are to adapt spontaneously or that the European Commission and Council will be able to operate with 20-21 members just as they do with 15 and, empirically speaking, solutions will be found? If at the IGC in Nice we tried to make enlargement conditional upon deepening, this would be viewed as a pretext for delaying the entry of the countries of the East, and Poland has recently voiced its displeasure at this. We are all aware that the accession of the countries of the East would mean a budgetary revolution and increased taxes. In other words, the revolution that looks set to take place in European affairs over the coming ten years is not an institutional one but a budgetary and tax one.

 Mr President, President Gama, Commissioner Barnier, in Feira, France will take over from Portugal to complete the IGC, the impossible reform of taxation on savings, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, defence policy, and sanctions against Austria.  Portugal has had a difficult presidency, with the collapse of the euro, and the collapse of the new economy, and, in Lisbon, had to deal with many problems like unemployment, the loss of Macao, the arrival of imitation port from South Africa, and even the arrival of the great criminal Rezala in your country, Mr President. But you finished up well, 3-2 against England, which, after all, is the most important thing for the people.  Perhaps we should launch a plan for a transatlantic football cup in Feira. It is perhaps our only chance of beating the United States. Mr Bayrou and Mr Cohn-Bendit might have a problem deciding which team to play for, but in the end there could be a juicy transfer contract. The broadcasting rights could be paid to Kosovo, Iraq or the victims of the construction of Europe. Then Europe could be some use for once.

) Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, there are not many of us, just the little Mediterranean family, trying to defend the crops that Brussels does not like. We have had the honey problem – Mr Fischler, you refused a few handfuls of euros for hive subsidies – the olive oil problem, and now it is the turn of walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts. Brussels does not want to be involved. We are told: there was the 1989 regulation, but it was provisional. The fixed aid for hazelnuts in 1996 was temporary. These measures have run their course and must come to an end. But to put an end to Community funding is to spoil what has been achieved. In the name of the principle of continuity, coherence and protecting the financial interests of the European Union, the aid that has already been committed must not be ended, especially since another aberration may be added to this one, the fact that we are in deficit. We are importing. And if that is making profits for Turkey, then fair enough, but making profits for California! You tell us that it is expensive, but you are not telling the whole truth. It costs EUR 250 million, but that is for years to come. You are avoiding giving the annual figure, which would represent 0.0 something percent, a tiny fraction of the European budget. In other words, Commissioner, action must be taken, first in the name of quality, in the name of seasonal employment, but also in the name of common sense, rurality, the environment, beauty. I do not know whether you have seen an almond tree in February, well it is truly a thing of beauty! And as we have told you, we are dealing with regions in Spain, in my native Languedoc-Roussillon, in Greece, where the land is arid. We must prevent a rural exodus. As a minimum, since extending the COM for fruit and vegetables is not a solution, we must set aside a few euros from the European budget to finance this activity. But on top of that, Commissioner – you and I were both in Seattle – there is the problem of Community preference. Our honey over Chinese, Canadian or Mexican honey. Our olives instead of North African olives and our Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Languedoc-Roussillon and French Mediterranean before Anatolia and California, Commissioner. Not for a fistful of dollars, but for a fistful of euros.

 Mr President, as far as debates go, Parliament is familiar with some absolute classics which crop up regularly: human rights, bananas, mad cows, and now tobacco. We are here involved in revising three directives on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco, cigarettes, snuff tobacco and other tobacco products. And, at this point, we have yet another classic debate, the one which concerns the legal basis: is this a matter to do with the market, in which case Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community applies, or the rules of operation or indeed health policy? The matter has been referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities. The rapporteur from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market suggests kicking the ball into touch by referring the debate back. Whatever the case, we are required to examine the content of the report before us. Regarding the content of the report, then, an accurate observation is made and the rapporteur makes some sensible proposals but, in the final analysis, the sideways shift sets in. As everyone recognises, the observation that tobacco causes disease and ultimately death is perfectly accurate, in the same way that the poverty generated by ultraliberalism is also ultimately harmful to health. Cigarettes contain tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, additives, citrates, tartrates, acetates, nitrates, sorbates, phosphates, even fungicides, and all these end up causing lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and cot death in infants, with 500 000 people dying every year. Of course, many more people die too. On the basis of these facts, then, some sensible proposals have been made. Tar content must be limited to 10 mg per cigarette and nicotine content to 1 mg per cigarette. There are even sensible suggestions to prohibit ammonia, which increases nicotine ingestion and thereby also dependence, and to earmark 2% of the profits made by tobacco multinationals for scientific research. These are intelligent and reasonable suggestions. There are also plans to provide information on the dangers of tobacco, and to protect children and even the infants at risk from sudden infant death syndrome. This, however, is the start of the sideslip into lack of realism, self-righteousness and fundamentalism. In other words, from an accurate observation and reasonable proposals, we move towards a problem that is even worse than tobacco itself. What is this sideways shift? In the first place, there is the bureaucratic sideslip with the business of the label. We are putting labels on everything. Indeed, the ecologist’s neurosis is revealed by the fact that the subject of labelling is raised. We have labels on meat, wine, GM products, chocolate. It is the trump card that beats any freedoms. And now, labels on tobacco but, mark you, for labelling tobacco we are talking serious business. The label must cover 30% of the packet surface, 35% if the wording is bilingual, and 12.5% of the outer surface of the wrapping for pipe tobacco. The label must be printed in black on a white background and the borders must be at least 3 mm and at most 4 mm wide, an average of 3.5 mm. The labels must feature text, but not just any old text, it must be printed in black Helvetica bold type, 100% intensity. Thus proving that tobacco affects not only the lungs but also the brain. The label must also feature a free telephone number for a body which the smoker can call to ask what dangers his habit involves. There must also be a slogan like ‘smoking kills’, ‘smoking is harmful to those around you’, ‘smoking impairs fertility’, and ‘smoking causes impotence’. So, seeing how impotent our governments are to deal with immigration, lack of security, tax problems, and unemployment, we can only conclude that they are heavy smokers. This is clearly not, however, a sensible measure. Let me give one example: tobacco was introduced into Europe at the same time as the potato. Tobacco farming was started immediately but it took several centuries for the potato to catch on. That is how irrational things can be. Even if there had been a label on the apple to say that there was a risk of being thrown out of Eden, Eve would still have bitten into it! What does that prove? Well, it goes to show that slogans are not effective, just as a price increase would not be effective, as it would only increase smuggling and crime. This is the sideslip into self-righteousness and hypocrisy. We are told that there are social costs. Yet the smoker pays excise duties of between 75 and 85% included in the price of tobacco. In my own country, revenue from excise duties is greater than that from recording rights. In other words, by smoking, the smoker is paying for the cost of his own cancer treatment. People have said that it is inconsistent to allocate a billion to tobacco farming and then pay out for the campaign against tobacco. True, but it is just as inconsistent to bomb Kosovo and then pay to rebuild it, or to eliminate internal borders and lose customs duties and then set up OLAF to defend the financial interests of the European Union. In demographic terms, is it not inconsistent, ladies and gentlemen, to permit the loss of 5 million Europeans per annum due to abortions and then to weep over 500 000 deaths due to smoking? Then there is the puritanical sideslip. The rapporteur sends a shiver down my spine when he speaks of social aberrations, social instincts. What I hear is: the Social Democratic Sweden of the 1960s sterilising fifteen year old adolescents because they were social misfits. I hear: moral order, the Salem witches. I hear: the Puritanism of northern Europe, these reformers desperate to reform everything, including the way we eat and drink. I hear: northern Europe banning wine, on the pretext that wines are harmful to health, but not banning injecting oneself with all sorts of substances. It is the same puritanical streak shared by Robespierre, Pol Pot, the Greens and the Quakers. Our rapporteur is a Liberal and should not forget the lessons of laissez-faire Liberalism: let them live, let them be born, let them drink and let them smoke.

 Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Böge, Commissioner, we have before us a proposal for a regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, which is to say degeneration of the brain in bovine animals, sheep, primates, antelope, cats and even humans, since there have been 53 cases of atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob in Great Britain, all fatal. So now we are going to adopt regulations to prevent an epidemic that we have known about since 1986, i.e. for fourteen years. It is rather late in the day to react, but even so over the last fourteen years we have done a great deal. Last month, for example, we decided to stick labels on meat to warn consumers. The Commission told us that it was impossible to enforce such labelling before 2002, sixteen years after the outbreak of the disease, but we have done something all the same. We have had discussions with Mr Delors, with Mr Santer, with Mr Prodi, with Mr McSharry, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, then Mr Steichen, and Mr Fischler. We have set up a committee of inquiry chaired by our fellow Member, Mr Böge, a temporary monitoring committee; we have even tabled a motion of censure, against Mr Böge’s wishes. We have heard expert opinions from Mr Dirringer, the German virologist, Mr Picoud, Mr Dormont, Scottish specialists, our Portuguese fellow Member, Garcia, was a specialist. We have had debates, topical and urgent questions on the embargo, etc. After fourteen years of discussion, there are few survivors of this war of nigh on twenty years – Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, Mr Cunha, Mr Böge, and myself. Mr Happart left us and Mr Pagel died. So I think it would be useful for the more recent Members, in the end, if I gave a sort of debriefing on the subject, quite apart from the problems with the legal basis under Article 100 A or BSE monitoring problems. The starting point for this business was the 1984 milk quotas. To improve their milk reference, our British friends drove their cows like some sort of engines, overfeeding them, and, in order to save on the cost of fodder, they fed their cows on meal made from carcasses. Then, again, to save fuel oil when manufacturing meal, they reduced the cooking temperature, thereby enabling the pathogen to survive. BSE is the tragic product of the race for profits and the British farm model. The disease has been identified since 1986, but nothing much was done until 1996. Why not? The public could not be thrown into a panic because the Maastricht Treaty had to be sold to them. So the press, the Commission and the European Parliament all knew about it, but did not say a word. So when, in March 1996, the British, via the British Ministers for Agriculture and Health, admitted that the disease could be transmitted to human beings, the necessary measures were not taken. Why? Because this time the reason the public could not be thrown into a panic was no longer to sell the Maastricht Treaty but the Treaty of Amsterdam. So, met first with silence and then with lies, the epidemic spread and we all know what the outcome of that was. In the first place, BSE has not been eradicated in Great Britain, and will not be eradicated. Secondly, the belated ban on meal did not serve to eradicate contamination. Thirdly, either contamination crossed over to the meal fed to poultry, or there is a third transmission route. In addition to maternal contamination, there may be transmission via the fields, the grazing land, the grass, and there may be badlands, as in the case of ovine scrapie, where the prion would be encysted and would return as soon as bovine animals were put to pasture there. Fourthly, Great Britain and the industrialists causing the contamination have not, as polluters, paid. It is innocent farmers, grain farmers, who are paying the price, in the same way that the farmers are paying for Kosovo. All in all, then, the directive and the regulation are all well and good, but they are somewhat hypocritical. We all agree that we need regulations on prevention, we are all agreed on adopting the amendments from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to whom the matter should have been referred. We all agree that scientific measures are needed, methods to be used in abattoirs to remove the ilia, the ganglia, the duodena, the inguinal, medial, lateral, renal, prefemoral and cervical lymph nodes, but this is not the key issue. In the BSE crisis, at the moment of truth, when protective action had to be taken, it was taken by the national states. That is the main lesson to be learnt from the TSE business. Firstly, protection is always led by the states. Secondly, the precautionary principle means safeguarding nations. This is no obstacle to the construction of Europe but, like children making tree houses, it is just a game. That is what we are doing here, Mr President, all playing out together.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, seven out of every ten bananas eaten in Europe come from Central America via three multinationals, all with reduced customs duties of EUR 75 per tonne instead of EUR 850. We are giving the United States a marvellous present there! Well, it is not enough! The United States wants more. Technically, what does it want? It wants the end of import licences, because the B licences give Community bananas and ACP bananas priority sales over dollar bananas. But, most of all and politically, the United States actually wants the monopoly of the future Eastern European market for their multinationals. What is Europe doing to face that challenge? It is divided and getting bogged down. We are divided from our German friends. Indeed, because of the ancient links with the 1945 German diaspora to Latin America, Germany has eaten 100% dollar bananas since 1960 – though at first they were ‘armband’ bananas. So much so – it is an open secret – that the three American banana multinationals put their banana butter on SPD and CDU parsnips. But we are also getting bogged down in technical proposals. Thus the Commission proposes, before surrendering totally to the United States, a six-year transition period when, in essence, there would be three quotas, including the ACP quota and the dollar quota. From 2006, there would no longer be anything but a common customs tariff which would have equal impact on the bananas of the poor of Africa and the bananas of the rich, the multinationals. We could undoubtedly challenge that, and our excellent rapporteur, Mr Dary, does challenge it. He proposes that the respite of six years be extended to ten years. Another four years, Mr American executioner! And we have tabled amendments too. We call for regionalisation of aid, because Guadeloupe is further away than the Canaries; quarterly payment; cyclone compensation; the maintenance of the ACP quota; historical guidelines for imports, instead of first come, first served. Well, all that is very fine, but the battle is elsewhere. The battle is for Community preference, first and foremost. We have to choose: either the Canaries, Madeira and the Antilles – or Chiquita. It is regional policy that is at stake. Do we want the outermost regions which depend 100% on bananas, like the Canaries, to survive, or do we want Dole and Chiquita to accumulate more wealth? It is cooperation policy that is at stake. We have to choose: either Africa and the Lomé Convention, or the WTO. We have to choose: either Europe’s social policy and human rights, or the multinational slave-drivers who produce with social costs totalling 8% instead of the 42% social costs in the Canaries, Madeira or the Antilles. This is about protection of financial interests, because when OLAF disputes a few centimes of Members’ taxi expenses yet is not interested in the annual present of two billion dollars from Chiquita, there is a problem. The United States was found guilty of two billion dollars’ worth of fiscal fraud and it has changed nothing. When the United States alters its policy, we will discuss the mere 191 million for bananas. When the United States stops cheating for the benefit of Boeing, Kodak, Cargil and Ford, we will discuss bananas. In the meantime, we need long, global, political negotiations. We must talk about Iraq, Echelon, Serbia; put everything on the table. Sanction for sanction, retaliation for retaliation. The banana is a moment of truth. Europe can either surrender or stand up and be counted. There is a saying that bananas can be eaten from both ends. Does Europe want to stand up or be eaten from both ends?

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are debating a tragic issue – a source of shame to all of us – and Mr Ford is not here. Not one of Parliament’s noble spirits is here, and yet the sanctions against Iraq are already ten years old, ten years! People think the war, the missiles and the gassings are over, but the filthy effects of this war, which was never clean, go on. There is still bombing in the North and in the South. Cornfields are being burned in a country which invented agriculture; date palms are being burned daily. In the Strasbourg newspaper yesterday, there was an interview with a priest who risked his life just to go to the Babylon area, in Ur. For people who go there, taking ambulances and medicines, like me and the National Front, Iraq is a vast concentration camp. 18 million women, children, old people, men, a whole Arab people, are being held captive in their own country by the West, with millions of deaths every day, hundreds of children dying, a systematic, scientific, meticulous, planned, cynical, perverse genocide. It is not just their bodies which are under attack by being deprived of food, milk, meat and fruit. Their minds are under attack as well. There are no books. Even pencils are banned, on the pretext that their graphite could be used as coolant in the nuclear power stations. There are schools but there is no paper. There are doctors, but there is no medicine. There are hospitals, but there is nothing inside them. It is perverse. They were promised food in exchange for oil. But they are asked to practically give their oil away and then buy food. Ladies and gentlemen – especially Members who are not here – by what right is this happening? Do not keep silent! Do not be accomplices! UN officials are resigning. We should not have to go there in thirty years time, like the Belgians in Rwanda, and say sorry, or like the Holy Father, who is prostrating himself all over the place. The honour of Europe depends on our speaking out for these young Arabs, for this great people being consigned to the night. It is all very well being afraid of imaginary dangers in Vienna, but it is in Baghdad that the violation of human rights is taking place. Let Washington’s Nebuchadnezzar let these people go, these slaves in their own country. They must be released from this poverty. I appeal to your consciences! Europe is denying itself! Just as people kept silent about Spain in 1936, just as people kept silent about the camps, they are keeping silent about Iraq. There is no time to lose; this people could cease to exist. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to act quickly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the 1960s people used to say Africa was not on the right track, and now, in 2000, Africa has still not arrived. And why not? Because no destination was established. Where do you expect to get if you do not know where exactly you are heading? Africa’s initial objective was to achieve independence, with nation states instead of ethnic tribes, and the result was Rwanda, the Hutus and the Tutsis, Nigeria, the Ibos, and Biafra. The next objective was Socialism, the fair-haired comrades. Black Africa was supposed to turn red. The result was famine in Ethiopia, Algeria’s agriculture destroyed, not to mention Guinea under Sékou Touré. The white man, Mitterand, then offered Africa parliamentary democracy, parties instead of tribes. The result was a permanent situation of coup d’état, even in the Ivory Coast. The present objective appears to be liberalism, the market, the IMF, the World Trade Organisation. The result is rebellion by the poor people of Tunis and the poor people of Casablanca at the rise in prices, European meat destroying the Fulani’s livestock farming in Africa, the Latin American banana destroying the Cameroon or Ivory Coast banana, and fats extracted from GMOs are about to destroy the Ivory Coast’s cocoa. All in all, from Socialist Africa to ultraliberal Africa, from the European Development Fund to the World Bank, from the summits in Bujumbura, Addis-Ababa, Nairobi, Casablanca, and now, on 3 April, Cairo, it is always the same assessment, the same threesome of poverty, epidemic and massacre. Even so, on 4 January, the UN found the final solution, or the miracle cure: a proportion of the 800 million Africans would have to emigrate. They even set a figure: 159 million Africans were to be unloaded on Europe by 2025. In the same way that the problems of the inner city are not solved by building towns in the countryside, Africa’s problems will not be solved by shifting part of Africa to Europe. The logical thing to do today is to apply to Africa what has worked elsewhere, what has worked wonders in our countries, in the United States, in Europe, the solution which in our countries created heavy industry, agriculture, the textile industry, the solution which in our countries created growth and sustainable development. There is one word for this solution – protectionism, and there is one instrument for this solution – customs barriers. This solution has been worked out in theoretical terms, and called ‘self-centred development’. And, what is more, the new Senegalese President is inspired by this, telling the young people that they should get involved rather than waiting for the billions to arrive from Europe. In practical terms, Africa will achieve the first stage in growth according to the Rostow model if it protects its agriculture, its livestock farming, its self-employed craft industry, and its emergent economy. Opening up to the world market, on the other hand, will expose it to the law of the jungle and to the plundering of the natural resources of Africa, wood, oil, minerals, the flora and even the fauna, by multinationals. This is, moreover, what we have seen, ladies and gentlemen, with the privatisation of specific key sectors in Africa. For the Africans it was a negative outcome. Africa does not therefore need either the cut-throat world economy or the economy of world charity, with the Holy Father and the Blessed Jacques Chirac, or the cancellation of a government debt of EUR 300 billion. The watchword of the solution is customs protection on the African side and, on the European side, intelligent intergovernmental cooperation, of which the Lomé Convention was a prime example. In this respect, the Mediterranean could serve as a test bench for a Euro-African policy which respects identities. We in the Front National
 proposed a practical working method which involved dealing with the individual issues – water resources, soil erosion, desertification, the management of fisheries resources, livestock farming, pollution, control of migration flows – in a Marshall plan for the Mediterranean and Africa which would be funded from customs duties, reimbursable to African states in the form of open credit accounts in European banks. We have proposed an international organisation, with an intergovernmental high-secretariat of the Mediterranean. This would have its headquarters in Cairo, Tangiers or Tunis. An interparliamentary assembly, like that of the ACP. I feel that Athens would be the ideal site, or perhaps even a university in Valencia, Montpellier, Nice or Barcelona. And there perhaps the words of Raymond Loulle would hold sway. The practical implementation of these Euro-Mediterranean projects, respecting the identities of both shores, north and south, and involving around twenty Euro-Mediterranean states, would open the way to greater ambitions. It could then be extended to relations between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. This is a great project, Mr President, on the scale of humanity as a whole, and humanity needs both Africans and Europeans. All the more reason not to flood Africa with the unregulated world economy and not to flood Europe with an influx of people. Humanity needs Africa where, it is said for the first time, in Kenya, man first stood upright, and humanity needs Europe where, for the first time, in Greece, thought first stood upright.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fourteen years after BSE first appeared, we have finally got around to doing something about labelling meat in order to protect consumers and ensure traceability. This protection is undoubtedly belated in principle but, above all, illusory in practice. Firstly, in the draft regulation, 50% of European meat is effectively exempt from compulsory labelling if it is minced or cut. For the remaining 50%, labelling is not compulsory until 2003, which means that we have three years to dispose of British surplus stocks. And after 2003, the designation of origin may be limited to a simple indication of ‘EC origin’ with no mention of the country. What is more, to bury the prion under even more details, the label is laden down with indications of: the place where the animal was born, fattened, slaughtered and boned, with the Member State of origin, the region of origin, the farm of origin, a total of twelve items, plus the price and the weight, making a total of fourteen items, which is simply too much to read and take in. So, Mr Papayannakis is improving the system, the deadline for compulsory labelling has been brought forward from 2003 to 2001, since 2000 is out of the question; labelling is to be simplified, the national labelling systems mandatory in France, Belgium and Finland are to be retained. This is a good move. The amendments will be adopted. The unwillingness of the Commission is, however, with apologies to the Commissioner, apparent to everyone. As a solution, labelling is a good idea only at first sight. Labelling is no safeguard against GMOs, chocolate containing vegetable fats or, tomorrow, GMO fats, or, at a later date, American hormone-treated beef, or prion-infected meat. The only effective protection would be checks, and this requires States and frontiers. We have, however, eliminated frontiers, and this is the price we have to pay for Europe: freedom of movement at the expense of safety. I just hope, ladies and gentlemen, that no one will have to be punished in future. Previously one could be punished at the stake, now punishment would mean a steak, a British beefsteak.

 Madam President, so the country of the Statue of Liberty, Jefferson, Lincoln, and human rights is listening in on all world communications by cable, satellite, telephone, fax, e-mail or mobile phone! That is obviously a shock, not in terms of our technical knowledge of encryption, but in terms of our political beliefs. We have believed in the great market as if it were God, and competition and competitiveness, all under the governance of the WTO. With Mr Monti, and Mr Van Miert before him, we have done everything possible to keep competition pure and perfect, even against the interests of our own businesses, our banks, our airlines, our insurance companies, Crédit Lyonnais, Rhone-Poulenc. And now we find out that people are cheating and spying on this market, creating distortions of competition. This Parliament, which wanted to use OLAF to spy on Members for the sake of protecting Europe’s financial interests, is discovering that we are being spied on by the United States against our financial interests, even as regards the WTO negotiations. We thought Mr Haider’s Austria was endangering our freedom. But it is through Mr Tony Blair’s Britain, Glyn Ford’s Britain, that fifteen thousand agents, stationed in Gibraltar, Cyprus, and even on British territory, are spying on us. So, Madam President, are you still prepared to go to London? Will you ever go to Sydney again? Will you ever go to Ottawa or Wellington again? And we thought there was solidarity in Europe. Now we find that Britain’s solidarity extends across the Atlantic and across the Pacific Ocean. We thought we were building Europe, making Europe stronger. But stronger than whom? Stronger in opposition to Iraq? In opposition to the Serbs? Stronger in opposition to nations and nationalism? But with ‘Echelon’, we find that Boeing belongs to a specific nation, Rayton belongs to a specific nation, and they are having people spy on Airbus or Thomson because those companies do not belong to the same nation. ‘Echelon’ brings us face to face with nationalism, but it is the ethnic nationalism of the Anglo-Saxon ethnic group, which includes Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. It is an ethnic group with a religious base, the holy alliance of Adam Smith and Calvin. So is the Catholic Europe of Gasperi, Schuman and Adenauer going to apologise? Apologise to the people spied on, for all that evangelism? ‘Echelon’ is the French word for rung, and I am afraid this ‘Echelon’ is taking us down to the bottom rung and we will end up at dignity level zero. Poor old European Commission! Poor old European Council of Ministers! Poor old European Union! We are conditioned by the circumstances of our birth. Something born of a Harvard University lecture theatre under the presidency of the American, General Marshall, is bound to end up obeying its creator.

 In the last half century, after several centuries’ pause, massive migrations have started again on the planet. From south to north, from east to west, across Europe, these ceaseless waves of migrants destabilise the economic, budgetary, social, urban, religious and cultural balance.  Security, the first fundamental public freedom, is no longer guaranteed in European towns, the scene, since the 1970s, of drugs, muggings on trains, in the streets, on public transport, cars set alight, schools vandalised, murderous new crimes, lawlessness in the suburbs, town centres emptying and fear seeping in and taking over. Observation of the facts shows that these two phenomena, migration and insecurity, are linked in time and space and involve the same persons. It can therefore be legitimately concluded that this is a case of cause and effect. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, Europe has been in charge of the regulation of asylum, refugees and migrants. So what is Europe doing? Europe is drawing up plans and developing measures, 108 to be precise, with unspecified funding of course. Faced with a planetary phenomenon of migration, we counter it with plans, budgets and information campaigns. No doubt if Rome, Byzantium, Spain and Europe had had such plans, then Alaric, Attila, the Saracens, Tamburlaine, the Ottomans, the sack of Rome, the fall of Constantinople, the raids on the Mediterranean coasts and centuries of fear could all have been prevented. What it all adds up to is that, once again, the decision makers of the European Union are not dealing with either the causes or the scope of the problem. In the end, if there is a migration towards the European continent, that is because this continent is emptying fast. Italy, for example, will lose 17 million people from the workforce between now and 2050, and you are happy to conclude, along with the UN population division, that 159 million non-Europeans will have to be imported between now and 2050. But between now and 2050, two generations could be born here, in Europe, with the right demographic policy for the same budgetary cost as has been allocated to importing non-Europeans. With population growth relaunched, Europe would create the internal market, the new demand and the additional dynamism needed to resolve at a stroke the stupid problem of unemployment created artificially by a policy of recession, immigration and ruinous taxation. But for that to happen, we would have to deal with causes and the European Union is all about treating symptoms, prescribing palliatives and nursing care for an extremely elderly continent which is being allowed to sink into an Asian and African demographic lagoon.

 Mr President, for centuries, cows have eaten grass and chocolate has been made from cocoa. Then, a few years ago, Great Britain, which gave the world meat served with jam, hooligans and Adam Smith, started to feed cows on cadavers and to manufacture chocolate without cocoa. These aberrations should have remained confined to the British Isles, but doing away with borders within Europe has allowed adulterated chocolate to move freely, to the extent that today, in seven out of our fifteen countries, without being aware of it, consumers are swallowing chocolate that has been tampered with, and that includes Mr Haider’s Austria which, in that respect, has something in common with Mr Guterres’ Portugal. In order to reassure us, we are told that the imitation cocoa is restricted to six tropical products: illipe from Borneo, butter from shea nuts – which are also used to manufacture aircraft engine oil – etc. As we go from directives to amendments, however, these six products become seven, eight, nine, up to and including soya, oilseed rape and GMOs. We are also told that the cocoa fraud will be limited to 5% to begin with, then to 10%, not to mention that no check will ever be carried out, in the same way that, for example, the boxes of Chiquita bananas are not checked, which are supposed to weigh eighteen kilograms and in fact weigh twenty. The checks are pointless in any case, as we are told that the margin of error is 1%, whereas scientists tell us that it is in fact 40%. We are told above all to ‘eat and drink without fear, you are protected by the label’. Yet the label is a deception in graphic terms because it is illegible and a hypocrisy in scientific terms because the mention of ‘palm oil’, for example, is drowned among the list of ingredients. Just as in the case of port we are not told ‘South African counterfeit’, for cocoa we are not told ‘counterfeit’.  Then, lacking arguments to justify the chocolate fraud, the multinationals say, ‘You must accept 5%, or there will be wholesale fraud.’ What then? All you have to do is call the product ‘shea-late’ if it is made from shea nuts, or ‘soya-late’ if it is made from soya, but not ‘chocolate’. The 388 000 tonnes of French chocolate, for example, must be made from cocoa, and the French turnover of FRF 19 billion, for example, must be earned honestly by small specialists.  It is a legal obligation with regard to the Ivory Coast and African farmers. We are linked by the Lomé convention and by the convention on commodities which the European Union has signed, with reference to cocoa. It is also a financial obligation. If we do not fulfil it, then we shall be forced to compensate for the losses in these countries under the Stabex system. It is an obligation in terms of health and food safety, since the substitutes for cocoa, such as Brazil nuts, may cause immunological reactions. Finally, it is a question of honesty, of morality. Let us put an end to this widespread dishonesty, where you begin with a product incorrectly described as chocolate and you end with a Commission incorrectly described as European, whose members are Americanically-modified organisms and whose standard is a flag of convenience concealing a globalist cargo.

 Mr President, many disasters do admittedly take place, sometimes with reports which make one’s blood run cold, including, for example, the  35 000 deaths in Caracas. The disturbing thing about the Erika
 disaster, however, following the Amoco Cadiz
 disaster and so many others before it, is that it was all so predictable. It was all perfectly avoidable since the same causes produce the same effects, and we had identified the causes. The causes are not the trivial details, the lack of technical measures, double hulls, all the petty details that the Greens are so fond of. Just now Mr Piétrasanta offered us an anthology of these petty details. The causes are: the lack of a merchant navy, forcing people to resort to slave ships; the floating wrecks which are to be found in the waters off Athens; the lack of shipyards, causing us to go to Montenegro for ships; the lack of a fiscal and social policy enabling us to compete in the globalised system, and the maritime imperialism which dates back to the time of Grotius of Holland, which involved obstructing everything else in order to preserve Rotterdam. And what does Brussels do instead of bringing in changes? It accepts Malta, the world leader in flags of convenience, as a candidate, in the same way that accepting Turkey would be a sensible course of action in terms of the fight against immigration. I am therefore fearful on behalf of the shellfish farmers, the fishermen, the coastal communities, the wild birds and nature. Yet more Erikas will be wrecked because natural disasters and Erika-type disasters are the offshoots of globalisation, and globalisation is the hidden cargo sailing under the European flag of convenience.

 Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move. We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice. It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase? What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d’Yeu 
or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch? What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it. What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide. Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset. Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing – although it plays a serious and negative part – but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence. But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats. For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen. Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity. That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.

 Mr President, I am the speaker for the TDI Group, even if I am speaking on behalf of just one of its component parts. We are dealing with the matter of ballast in fluorescent tubes. Now what does this actually mean? The electric current in fluorescent lamps, such as those providing the lighting above our heads, is regulated and stabilised by small devices called ballasts. For fifty years, these ballasts have been made from a copper coil in a sheet metal box. They are called “ferromagnetic ballasts”. Nowadays, however, we have electronic ballasts. The traditional ferromagnetic ballasts are said to entail a certain loss of energy, particularly due to resistance. The loss would be up to 8 watts an hour, whereas the electronic ones would lose only 3 watts. They would therefore allow for a saving of 5 watts and, multiplying that by 130 million ballasts, you would save millions of tonnes of energy, there would be less CO2, the greenhouse effect would be reduced and mankind would breathe more easily. Consequently, in eight years time, we would have to abandon ferromagnetic ballasts in favour of electronic ballasts. Unfortunately, Mr Turmes does not tell us that the electronic ballast has a shorter service life than the ferromagnetic one. Therefore, more of them will have to be manufactured, with more energy consumed and the savings just mentioned will partly disappear. Furthermore, these electronic ballasts are made with transistors that contain heavy metals, such as tantalum, germanium, and even arsenic, not to mention plastic, that is to say, non-biodegradable pollutants, whereas the copper and sheet metal of the ferromagnetic ballasts are biodegradable. In other words, for a saving of energy that is not as clear cut as it seems, our Green colleagues are prepared to release heavy metals and arsenic into the environment. At the same time, in addition to increasing pollution, unemployment will increase because the components used in the manufacture of the electronic ballasts and the machines that make them are not European. So, in order to avoid import costs, our manufacturers are going to relocate and thus reduce the number of jobs. In the final analysis, in wishing to make a modest saving of energy by using electronic ballasts, at a time when our manufacturers are demanding simply a gradual and selective ban, what we have at best is a saving but also the release of pollutants and increased unemployment. Nor are we tackling the real problem of waste, that is to say, incandescent lamps that show losses of up to 50 watts in comparison with fluorescent lamps. But it is true that incandescent lamps are manufactured by two multinationals, Philips and Osram. And so maybe there is a connection between the internationalists of the European Commission, the internationalists of the nebulous green multinational and the transnationals of industry, but I am not asking that we shed light on the whole business.

 Mr Gama, we are delighted that you hold the first presidency of the new millennium. This is because in Brussels, in light of the events in Timor and Macao, you informed Europe that its fate could be as an organisation of the past without any future. The opportunity afforded by the timetable gives you a role you are familiar with, as your namesake, Vasco de Gama, was also an explorer. You are to start preparations for the IGC, but first you must deal with some other outstanding issues. For example, there is the cooperation agreement with South Africa and the special agreement on wine. Port, ouzo, grappa and sherry are being pirated by South Africa which refuses to respect its undertaking. What are you going to do? Another issue to be dealt with is the euro which is working as a common currency. So why change something which works? With VAT, the transitional period has been extended. Why not do the same for the euro? Among the new issues is the employment summit in March. If we do not fight against excessive globalisation, immigration and taxation, these problems will not be solved, unless we wait for a miracle of Fatima. What are you going to do in this respect? Then there is the Intergovernmental Conference. We anxiously await its results, particularly as some want to move towards establishing a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. You are going to make justice a priority, yet you have in your country the murderer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, who France allowed to escape and Spain released. We will closely monitor the decision you take regarding him. Finally there is the opening up to the East. In the West, Europe starts with you but how far east will it go? To the border with Iran, to the Caucasus, from Lisbon to Moscow? You must ask some solid questions on all these issues, Mr Gama. We will see whether your French socialist comrades who will assume the presidency after you can provide some solid answers.

 Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason. Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General. Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF. All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible. And indeed there is a twofold shift. Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor. All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact. Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us. Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.

 The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources. The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences. Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources. Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as. This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us. It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission. Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States. This is a long way from offshoots such as the “Community criminal code”, the “European Public Prosecutor” or a European police force, with OLAF. There is as yet no federal European tax. All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.

 Mr President, the President of the European Parliament has just signed this budget for over EUR 90 billion. It would be good if she could also sign the rather more modest payment orders for the taxi drivers who bring Members here to this House. I would remind you that these taxi drivers earn about FF 10 000 per sitting or roughly EUR 1 500. However, they do not receive this payment until three or four months later! During this time they have to pay VAT at 20.6% and so are effectively giving Parliament a cash advance. Over three or four months this amounts to about EUR 5 000. By not being able to invest this money, given the free movement of capital which we have authorised, they are losing in the order of FF 1 500 per month. I am delighted that everyone is rejoicing, including Mr Colom I Naval and Mrs Fontaine, but our taxi drivers and chauffeurs cannot rejoice. I would remind those who were driven here by these taxi drivers in November that they will not be paid until March. Mr President, I believe this affects you as much as the rest of us. It would be good if the taxi drivers, like the beekeepers, could also participate in the joy of Mrs Fontaine and the European Parliament which has achieved what we could call a victory over the Council.

 The beef labelling proposal is now before us as the labelling of GMOs was previously. Labelling has become the wonder tool. Through it, food safety will reign, the consumer will be protected and our Green colleagues will be satisfied at having ensured the survival of humanity, at least in terms of food … In reality, labelling is one of those tricks so well loved by the leaders of Europe for calming people’s anxieties without actually solving any problems. The labelling of GMOs should already be ringing alarm bells. We have no idea what to put on the labels. For example, do we put ‘product of biotechnologies’? If we put both ‘bio’ and ‘techno’ on a product’s label, consumers will fall over themselves to buy it.  This beef labelling proposal is therefore revealing the length of the Commission’s nose like a Community Pinocchio. This is the Brussels institution which, in 1997, decided on labelling for beef. Yet it is only now telling us that it is not technically capable of identifying the origin of bovine animals. If the origin of bovine animals cannot be identified, how can we be sure that British beef presents no risk? We have to go one way or the other. If we know the provenance of bovine animals, then the lifting of the ban on British beef can be guaranteed and these animals can also be labelled. Yet, if we cannot label these animals because we do not know the origin of the meat, how can we then lift the ban? In other words, in the same week, France cannot be forced to lift its ban because the meat is traceable to a certain extent, while the request for labelling has been turned down on account of the technical impossibility of tracing the animals. Who can actually believe that in the three years since 1997 we have not managed to label meat by indicating the origin of the animal? Despite the fact that we can already indicate the location of the slaughterhouse, we cannot give the provenance of the slaughtered animal. The European Commission really does not care about consumers or the people. Brussels wants one thing only which is to ensure the free movement of products, capital, people and now contaminated British beef, at any price and without any obstacles. It is clear that labelling would result in the de facto
 boycott of British beef by consumers who do not want to compromise what remains of their brains after being fried by television news. In essence, the slogan of the European Commission and of the whole concept of European construction is ‘profit before life’ and has been so since ‘the Europe of our brainless forefathers’. This is so obvious that the only label which might ensure safety would be one which read ‘official from Brussels’.

 Madam President, if this is a question of legal competence, then Mr Monti is as competent as Mr Byrne to give the Commission’s collectively decided opinion. If this is a question of scientific competence, then Mr Byrne is as incompetent as any scientist who knows nothing about prions. We know nothing about these particles. If this is a question of good sense, then it involves French consumers not wanting the few kilos of British meat in question and discussions will make no difference. So this must be a question of psychoanalysis. The British Members are upset. The quicker they are able to vent their feelings, the quicker we can start the psychotherapy by listening to them and the quicker they will be able to calm down. We should therefore start the debate straightaway in order to calm them.

 Madam President, my British colleagues must realise that this is a scientific, political, legal and moral problem. On the scientific level, first of all this disease is due to an unknown agent. It is not a bacteria and it is probably not a virus, even though the German Professor Diringer believes otherwise. It is due to a mysterious prion. Secondly, there is no ante-mortem test. Thirdly, the disease is not disappearing despite the ban on meal. Fourthly, acarids full of prions are being found on fodder. This shows that the disease can be transmitted through fodder or grass and might mean that your soil is blighted forever and should not be used for breeding cattle. For the moment therefore, science cannot settle the matter. You have played the ball into the political court and it is therefore a question of whether trade or health takes priority. Is selling or living more important? The majority of the world’s countries, including your American and Canadian cousins and even your Australian and New Zealand friends in the Commonwealth, are saying that they want to live first and then sell. Yet you are demanding sanctions and creating a legal problem. Legally, there are two problems, the first of which is the priority among regulations. Should we give priority to the principle of free movement or to the precautionary principle? On the issue of BST, which does not present any danger to human health, we gave priority to the precautionary principle which we pleaded in Seattle. The second legal problem is one of legal responsibility. You are the guilty party because you created this disease from start to finish. In financial terms, we assumed the risk for two years but we cannot accept this risk in terms of health. There is also a moral or theological problem, as previously identified by Saint Thomas Aquinas, Antigone and Creon. Should human law come before natural law? It appears that, using human law, you have created an epizootic disease and a zoonosis. I would remind you that the latest child to be dying from your disease is only 13 years old. Well, we do not want to die. Finally, on the religious level, your Agriculture Minister told us two years ago in the Committee on Agriculture that this disease was due to God. As Christmas approaches, you should pray to God and hope that Father Christmas brings us a diagnostic test. You should try to ask forgiveness from God. Yet to do this, you need to repent your sins … (The President cut the speaker off)

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, between the first and second readings of the draft budget for the year 2000 we have added EUR 3.5 billion, in other words another three and a half billion in taxes. This would not be much if the money were not squandered in and, above all, outside Europe. In Europe, appropriations for the reconstruction of Kosovo would have been saved had we not destroyed Kosovo on the basis of alleged massacres ascribed to the Serbs as the OSCE has now admitted. Especially as we are redirecting EUR 110 billion allocated to rural development in order to finance Kosovo. In other words, we are robbing our own farmers in order to pay the Albanians in the name of the principle of “you first”.  It is as unhealthy as the fact that half our debates here this afternoon have been devoted to a province of the Serbian State which is not even a member of the European Union. It is true that, as far as the European budget is concerned, the worst offences are committed when we pour money outside the continent of Europe: EUR 10 million for Central Asia, EUR 14.5 million for the displaced people of Latin America, EUR 4 million for human rights in South Africa and Timor etc., etc. That would be all well and good if, at the same time, we were not planning to cut EUR 5 million from appropriations for our beekeepers who face competition from adulterated honey from abroad.  While we are spending money here, social austerity is being imposed in our 15 countries. Doctors and nurses in French hospitals, who are among the most qualified in the world, are today on strike because budgetary austerity has just cut back hospital expenditure and health expenditure. This situation is all the more disgusting in that, at the same time, we are paying EUR 45 million to ACP banana producers, some of which are American multinationals established in Cameroon and the Ivory Coast and which are being paid EUR 45 million under this European budget. This, then, is stupid spending on top of customer spending on top of ideological spending. It all adds up to a lot, it adds up to much too much and that is reason enough to vote against it.

 There is indeed corruption. Both in the left wing in power and in the right wing in government. The names of the cases tell the whole story: Agusta in Belgium, Urba in France, Palermo in Italy, fictitious jobs in the Parisian public transport network – RPR, the Mutuelle nationale des étudiants de France
 or Dominique Strauss-Kahn. But, because we in the Front National
 do not suffer the anxiety affecting the potential accused in the other parties, we are rejecting the extension of police powers to that tool of the Brussels Commission that goes by the name of OLAF. -	Firstly, because OLAF contravenes the idea of the separation of authority, which is the bedrock of Western democracy, with officials who have no legitimacy supervising the representatives of the sovereign states. -	Secondly, because OLAF is the thief set to catch the policeman, since the European Commission, at the centre of the suspicions of corruption, is in fact, by means of OLAF, going to be supervising the Parliament, whereas it is Parliament which should be doing the supervising rather than being its target. -	Finally, OLAF does not attack the causes of corruption, which lie in the removal of national borders allowing freedom of movement for drugs money, fraud and financial crime. If we really wish to fight the simple symptoms of corruption, while respecting the foundations of legitimate societies, then there are just two ways: -	either the technical route, by transforming the European Court of Auditors into a court of law and a court of budgetary discipline; -	or the democratic route, by creating a body at the heart of the European Union, as in Great Britain and the United States, which is the equivalent of the British “National Accounting Office” (NAO) or the American “General Accounting Office” (GAO). The latter are powerful autonomous supervisory bodies, but are located at the heart of the parliaments, and have a staff of up to 5,000. So, the expert body does exist, but with a connection to the representatives of the people who alone have the right to ask for explanations regarding the use of their taxes.

 Mr President, Commissioner, by the year 2005 at the latest the trade talks opened in Seattle will have been completed. Mr Lamy, you will again be there, in 2005, sitting in the same seat, and you will come and tell us that the European Union has enjoyed worldwide success in these global talks. In the final text of the regulations you will have achieved some mention of the precautionary principle, of health, even phyto-sanitary matters, an ILO-OMC forum and the recognition of environmental principles, insofar as they have already been recognised at Kyoto. The dispute settlement procedure will have been improved. Developing countries will have obtained positive discrimination, financed, indeed, by the European Union, like the ACP bananas. Chickens will have a few more centimetres’ room inside their cages, in the name of the animal welfare which will have been recognised, and the world of cinema and television will have obtained support in the form of a few aid programmes. In exchange, in order to achieve peace – and, indeed, a new peace clause – you will have made a number of concessions at Seattle. So, the “European Market” share will go from 5% to X%, there will only be residual internal support, export aid will have been prohibited, customs duties and tariff peaks will no longer be in place, direct investment will have been obtained thanks to Mr Lamy, and no thanks to the MAI, and the world market will have been established, a sort of commercial Fukuyama, and the GATT story will be over. Then what will we do? The tenth round of the Uruguay Round will have no further business. You yourself could perhaps always go back to Crédit Lyonnais or to some multinational which hands out stock options. But what of the farmers, who will have been wiped out, the professions excluded from society, the textile industry, pharmaceuticals, shoes, heavy-duty vehicles, furniture, ships, toys, all that which will have been delivered up to competition from outside Europe, what is to become of them? It is all very well for us to produce reports, books, television programmes and fine speeches. The children of the Seattle negotiators will have their place in the twenty-first century and the children of the people excluded from society will, in turn, be excluded, since poverty is a socially transmitted disease. But, in the end, all that is unimportant. We are still strong enough to carry everyone else’s burdens.

 Madam President, Commissioner, please give me a straight yes or no answer. Have there been more than forty fatal cases of atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob due to mad cow disease, that is, a zoonosis? Commissioner, did or did not the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture receive a draft directive one month ago saying that until 2003, we would not be able to show the cattle’s provenance on the label? Commissioner, in what way is the scientific competence of the members of the Scientific Steering Committee superior to that of the German scientists, of the Scottish scientists and of the French scientists who tell you that there is a risk of zoonosis. Commissioner, who chooses the members of the Scientific Steering Committee? How are they chosen? How independent are they? Commissioner, how do you explain the fact that for seven years, two MEPs, the Belgian Socialist José Happart and myself said here, between September 1989 and March 1996, that there was a risk of zoonosis before the British Minister for agriculture admitted it on 24 March 1996 in the House of Commons? What good is the precautionary principle, Commissioner, when, if there is any doubt, we do not refrain from selling cattle that are still suspect? And finally, Commissioner, are you still prepared to say to the country of Fleming and Newton that Galileo was wrong to say that the earth turns, when the university and the Scientific Steering Committee say that the earth does not turn?

 Mr President, I understand the position of our British friends, just as I understand the position of our Portuguese friends who are also concerned, just as I understood the position of our Belgian friends in the dioxin affair and just as I understand even better the position of the French in the sewage sludge affair.  But this is not the same thing. Atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob is a terrifying disease which affects young men or women of around twenty years of age. First they lose the ability to move, to walk, they are confined to an armchair, their muscles waste away, they find it more and more difficult to breathe, they can see themselves dying and then die after six months. It is true that our British friends have taken precautions over traceability, that they have introduced a passport for cattle, that different types of meal have been banned since 1990, that conditions for the slaughter of animals have been changed, that lymph nodes, spinal marrow and lymphoid tissue are now removed and that only cattle less than thirty months old are exported. They have seen to it that the consequences of the terrible mistake made by the Demulder brothers in Yorkshire, which was the original cause of the disease, have been mitigated. It is nevertheless still the case that slaughter by means of a special pistol causes particles of the brain or lymphoid tissue to enter the jugular vein and from there they can reach the muscle mass. It is also true that there are still 3,000 cases every year in Great Britain, and that there are 40 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is the upper limit for normal rates of occurrence. It is nevertheless true that there are 650 cases of BSE per million head of cattle. People say to me that the cattle that are exported are in perfect condition. That may be true, but the disease incubates for 15 or 20 years. There may be no clinical signs when the cattle are imported, but they may be incubating the disease, and so may the Englishman who has eaten the meat! It is also true that the first results of the screening tests show that cattle that are clinically perfect may in fact already be affected. I am sure you understand why there is still some doubt. It was thought that the disease was transmitted by different kinds of meal. These kinds of meal have been banned but the disease still exists. It was thought that the disease was transmitted from mother to calf, and there is undoubtedly a third means of transmission perhaps through scrapie, through the soil or through fodder. There are some accursed fields from which a herd is removed and then, two years later, a new herd is put there, which also contracts the disease. Perhaps the same thing applies to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. You can understand then, why the French food safety agency recommended not lifting the ban. People say to us that things would be different if it were a European Agency. Would they? So French biology is one thing and Brussels biology is quite another. This harks back to Lysenko who, in the days of the Soviet Union, told us that there was one biology for proletarians and one for capitalists. This is completely untrue! The laws of biology apply to everyone. Professor Dormond and Jeanne Bruger Picou are two of the greatest scientists around, as is Professor Dirringer in Germany, as is one of the Scottish consultants, who also has his doubts.  People tell me that the ban has been lifted, and that first Germany and then France is resisting. I must remind you that at the beginning of 1996, when five German states refused to accept British beef, the European Commission tried to bring a liability action against them when all that these states were trying to do was to protect their citizens. Then a few weeks later, the European Commission imposed the ban and admitted that the German states had been right. We all agree on opposing meat containing american hormones and to the use of somatotrophin, a lactation hormone, when there is no scientific evidence to say that it is dangerous. Somatotrophin can cause mastitis in cows, but if we were to inject ourselves with it, we might experience a swelling in the chest, but it would not kill us. How can we refuse to accept meat containing american hormones and somatotrophin, when there is no clearly established risk, and yet accept British meat which presents a serious risk? How can we make a case for Europe and the precautionary principle at the WTO, whilst refusing to apply the precautionary principle in the case of British cows? There is a hierarchy of standards, and top of the hierarchy of standards is the health standard, then the standard of international trade. After all, our British friends are just reaping what they have sown. It was an Englishman, Ricardo, who explained the laws of international trade and its comparative advantages to us. He explained to the Portuguese that they should produce wine instead of cloth because the English were better at producing cloth. Well, my dear British friends, you should realise that others are better than you at producing cows, and maybe you should stop producing cows. In any case, you have been punished for your sins, which result from excessive free trade practises and from an excessively ultraliberal approach, for that is the fundamental cause of this pandemic and of this disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. We cannot take the risk of allowing young men of twenty to die just so that international trade may flourish.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the matter of renegotiating the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement which is due to expire on 30 November has been referred to us. This is one of the 29 fisheries agreements signed by the European Union with around fifteen countries of Africa and countries bordering the Indian Ocean. These negotiations are going to take place in a specific context, characterised by two new elements, firstly, the death of His Majesty Hassan II, the last giant figure in the history of the twentieth century, and, secondly, the principle of Turkey’s candidacy for accession, accepted a few days ago. When proposing to integrate a country which has nothing in common with Europe, it is hard to voice significant reservations with regard to Morocco which at least shares with Spain or France its language, history and economic relationships. Technically, Morocco wants comprehensive negotiations on fishing, the preservations of fish stocks, on local industry and even, more generally, on our agricultural dealings with Morocco. The position of our countries is essentially a budgetary position, with a cost of EUR 125 million per year. The main beneficiary is Spain which carries out 20% of its fishing production within the framework of the agreement with Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal. As for Portugal and France, they benefit to a lesser extent, and Italy too would like to derive advantage from it. Furthermore, Morocco wishes to preserve fishing resources within its economic area, and other countries, such as Great Britain, are announcing their concerns about the budget. It is true that the Community budget allocated to fisheries agreements is not inconsiderable: EUR 300 million, or 5% of the budget for European external policies. It is a not inconsiderable sum then, even if we lose nothing in the deal. If IFREMER is to be believed, then, for every euro invested, the turnover generated for Europe would be around three euros, and the added value would be 900 million. The Spanish are the main beneficiaries, with the Canaries where 91% of the fleet is dependent on this agreement, and with Andalusia where 75% of the fleet is involved, and there would be a cost to pay if there were to be no agreement. And indeed Morocco does not lose out either since almost a thousand jobs are affected by this agreement, for an annual added value of 36 million. But the Moroccans bring up, quite rightly, the risk of over-exploitation of fishing resources. Forty years ago, fishing catches worldwide were less than 20 million tonnes, today they are around 100 million tonnes, even if Europe is not responsible, as we are fishing less and less in the Mediterranean, where our share is no more than 40% of the catch. It is important, then, to monitor these fishing resources, which I know well, from the small ports of Oualidia or Media down to Mauritania by way of the Western Sahara, which I must remind Mrs McKenna is not independent, but has belonged to Morocco for centuries. How are we to find a compromise with the Moroccan Minister, El Khyari? On the European side, we could make concessions on the development of the local Moroccan processing industry, on aid for scientific research and on landings in Moroccan ports. There are still two stumbling blocks: firstly, the matter of abandoning community preference in the field of agriculture, and we already know the problems affecting the sectors of tomatoes, early fruit and vegetables or horticulture, and secondly, another point, on which we cannot yield involves trading the Spanish fleet’s fishing rights for an increase in immigration in a Europe which already has 18 million unemployed. Mr Fischler, you reminded us that you will be in Seattle. The problem must therefore be considered at a much higher level. These are not negotiations regarding just fishing, but are far wider-ranging negotiations, Euro-Mediterranean talks, or even WTO talks. If, in Seattle, we are going to give in to the United States on the subject of compensation funding in agriculture, then it will be difficult to refuse Morocco similar concessions in the agricultural sector. Clearly, too, Morocco-Europe relations must be evaluated at the summit. We must take advantage of His Majesty Mohamed VI’s forthcoming visit to Parliament to undertake comprehensive renegotiations, and we must ensure that Morocco is not destabilised by the sort of foolish remarks made just now by Mrs McKenna regarding some putative Saharan sovereignty. We know full well what the consequences would be if Algeria had access to the Atlantic coastline. Europe needs Morocco and vice-versa. The agreement must therefore be sought with respect for our shared identities, for sovereignty and also for our separate identities, while acknowledging that history has made Morocco, if not a cultural exception, then at least a Mediterranean exception, for Europe in general and for France in particular.

 Mr President, the draft budget for the year 2000, EUR 92 billion, a margin of flexibility for our Parliament of EUR 1.5 billion taking into consideration the Financial Perspective, the across-the-board reductions in all appropriations, or at least in appropriations for agriculture, the lack of ambition, and the usual thin spreading of resources and budgetary gimmickry; in other words, it is a draft budget with no great innovations. It is to Mr Bourlanges’ great credit that he attempted to make the discussion more lively by introducing technical objections. He presented a fine study with a sort of pot pourri of everything he has written since March and all that with the attitude of an official of the French Supreme Audit Office. Well, that is all very well. The only innovations are not deliberate. It is the first budget of the 21st century, one which will indeed see the dissolution of the European Union following the Seattle Conference where the Community preference will be abandoned. It is the first budget to implement the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006, which Mr Bourlanges is also asking that we review. It is the first budget which is going to verge on the EUR 100 billion mark if we adopt the amendments which Mr Bourlanges is proposing and, speaking of Mr Bourlanges, who I might call the financier from “Uncle Jean Monnet’s Cabin”, this is a first for him, his first report following the general report, after that of Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, Mr Tillich, Mr Lamassoure or others. Apart from the change in presentation in the form of Mr Bourlanges, 2000 is much like 1999 as far as the budget is concerned. Firstly one finds once again the European Parliament’s ongoing aspiration to make its presence felt. This has been a constant ever since 1979. This is a natural tendency on the part of all parliaments throughout the world. The judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Communities have multiplied. The 1995 budget was even cancelled, and President Hänsch refused to sign, and, every single time, there is this conflict about NCE and CE. Well, Mr Bourlanges is bringing us back to this bellicose atmosphere, even quoting Marshal Foch, which is appropriate, I suppose. In the backwater of the European budget there is not enough room for two crocodiles, the crocodile of the European Council and the crocodile of the European Parliament which, after eating up the Commission by toppling Santer, now wants to eat the Council too. So Mr Bourlanges proposes to be voluntarist, he wishes to increase Community expenditure by 7%, he is an ultraliberal who has forgotten the budget rationing pact which he wanted to inflict on others, and he is doling out money because Christmas is coming, 135 million for Turkey, 500 million for Kosovo. First we bomb, then we rebuild. And then there is even East Timor. It is said that it is old monarchs who concern themselves with foreign policy. Of course, the farmers are not entitled to the same largesse, unless they move to Turkey. The only problem, obviously, is that if you keep increasing expenditure, one day you will also have to increase revenue and contemplate a Community tax. But in the meantime, well, Italy will pay, and France will pay another EUR 600 million. I shall conclude, as Mr Bourlanges quoted Saint Matthew, by quoting Jesus, asking Simon Peter. “What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? Of their own children, or of strangers? Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.” But with Mr Bourlanges’ tendencies, how long will this freedom last?

Mr President, this new round of negotiations poses a question of principle, a question of method and a question of content. First of all with regard to principle, why have a new round? There has already been Tokyo, Kennedy, Nixon, Uruguay! Has humanity gained anything from them? If the rounds had not taken place, would we have been worse off? The MAI has not been signed, the transatlantic contract has not been signed! Yet, there has been no catastrophe. On the other hand, the GATT has been signed and there are still 18 million unemployed people in Europe. The NAFTA has been signed and Mexico has been bled dry. Scientifically, free trade is like the independence of central banks. There is no conclusive scientific evidence as to whether it is good or bad. We are not in a domain of science but in a domain of belief. It is basically as if in Seattle on 30 November the Church of Globology was going to meet. That means that the method is important. It is important that the Council monitors the mandate of the Commission, so that Blair House may not happen again, and that both the States and public opinion monitor it. This is because in France the sickle has revolted against MacDonalds and the Millennium has come out of hiding. As regards the content, there will clearly be a lot of questions. The question of services, audiovisual, social and environmental questions, developing countries and, of course the agricultural question, with the risk that Europe will behave like Bambi and Walt Disney. Europe will no doubt obtain labellings and traceability, it will be able to play with blue boxes and green boxes, but it will give in on the important points, that is, the internal support for the farmers and the Community preference. Mr Lamy, you have not even mentioned the term “Community preference”, hence our reservations regarding this round. To participate in these cycles, you have to be some sort of a cyclist. The only problem is that it is the people who do the pedalling and the very poorest who most suffer from the punctures. But it is true that we still have the strength to bear the evils of others!

 Professor Prodi, you are a man of great talent, surrounded by men and women of equally great talent: Professor Monti, Mr Barnier, and Mr Busquin, who survived where Mrs Cresson succumbed. The first thing your gifted Commission will have to deal with will be the major Seattle Conference. You are, together with Mr Lamy, the negotiator for the Fifteen. But are you going to work in transparency, or are you going to work as you did at Blair House in 1992, where we had to wait a year, until October 1993, before receiving the Blair House text? In other words, are you taking the democracy of Athens or the oligarchy of Venice as your model? And this is the real question of the Intergovernmental Conference. The problem is not the vote by qualified majority or the reduction in the number of Commissioners. The problem is how to work with realism, with compromise, perhaps even with such a compromise as there was in Luxembourg in 1965. After all, the World Trade Organisation has over 137 members and operates by consensus. We can therefore expand to twenty members while still respecting the identity of each one. In other words, expansion is not an institutional problem. It is perhaps a fiscal problem, to know who will pay: will there be a tax on revenue? It is perhaps a geographical problem: how far should we expand? You mentioned Ukraine. In the South, should we extend as far as Turkey? And then, at a certain point, we will be faced with an issue of civilisation, not between the civilisation of Maimonides, Averros or Saint Augustine, but between that of the Islamists, who carry out bombing in Moscow or massacres in East Timor, and the sophisticated civilisation which you represent. In other words, Mr Prodi, when one seeks to create a synthesis of East and West, the result is Byzantium, and you know how that ended. That is why we shall be voting against the Byzantine route, while admiring the “emperor” you could have been.

On the pretext of trying to simplify asylum rules and procedures, Brussels is in the process of creating a whole legal arsenal designed to overwhelm Europe. This draft contains a whole litany of proposals, each more pro-immigration and subversive than the one before. They want to make it easier to gain legal access to European Union territory for nationals of non-EU countries for the purposes of employment and family reunification, to make it impossible to authorise collective expulsions, to provide for joint management of migratory flows and for distribution of the (immigration) burden within the European Union, and so on. In other words, we are being asked to allow the Commission to impose immigration quotas on each Member State! We are surely in agreement on one point, namely the need to reform our asylum laws. Throughout Europe, the present asylum system is in the throes of a crisis. France, Britain, Italy and Germany have been inundated by the mass influx of asylum-seekers fleeing their countries of origin for economic reasons and not because of political persecution, as provided for in the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees. The solution does not lie in a broader and more permissive redefinition of the right of asylum; quite the contrary. Let us not offer impossible and dangerous dreams to all these unfortunate people who seek a hypothetical El Dorado.

 On the day after the day devoted to women’s rights, I am pleased to see that the European Parliament is also taking this issue to heart. No fewer than three reports on the subject are to be put to the vote today. Unfortunately, however, the reports only contain general and commonplace statements. The report on combating violence against children, young people and women is no exception. To combat this type of violence effectively, it is necessary to focus on those who perpetrate violence, not just on the victims. Above all, it is essential to be able to understand the social, family, economic or even religious reasons why individuals lose control and resort to violence. In truth, all this report does is to state that there has been an exponential rise in these types of violence. It fails to deal with the real causes of such behaviour. In fact, all this violence tends to result from the same causes. Violence against women cannot be eliminated without addressing the factors that contribute, directly or indirectly, to women being in a submissive position. I am thinking particularly of the status of women in Islam. In Islam, women are perceived as inferior and submissive. Under no circumstances are women’s rights a secondary consideration.

 The harsh fact is that women make up only 46% of the working population. There are 12 million working women and on average they earn 20% less than men. They are in fact victims of inequality, first of all in access to work: their unemployment rate is two points higher than for men and 80% of French adults earning less than the index-linked guaranteed minimum wage (SMIC) are women. There are a variety of solutions. Obviously, women must be given the means to make a genuine choice between working or not, that is they must be given the means to stay at home and look after their children if they so wish, by increasing family allowances, for example. Reconciling work and family life must at last be made possible, however. Today, single-parent families account on average for 14% of all families with children and 90% of single parents are women. These trends must be taken into account and working hours, childcare systems and childcare allowances, family benefits and parental (maternity or paternity) leave arranged accordingly. Equality between men and women certainly requires that. But we must be very careful to avoid quota systems such as we already have in the political field.

 Having been deaf and dumb for years – and not for lack of warnings – Parliament and the Commission have woken up. The Schengen agreements reducing interior border controls within Europe would appear to have had some perverse effects: increased illegal immigration, illegal employment, crime and all manner of trafficking. The only problem was that instead of dealing with the main cause of all of these problems, these scandalous Schengen agreements, our leaders are attacking their effects! This report thus proposes as a magic solution a common policy on immigration, on visas and border controls, in particular creating a ‘European Corps of Border Guards’, and thereby reducing Member States’ sovereignty over their territory. In order to combat illegal immigration, the report envisages implementing an ‘active policy on legal immigration". What hypocrisy! One might sum this up as meaning that, if there are too many illegal immigrants, we arrange for them all to be legalised. The French Government is indeed adept as this type of sleight of hand. In truth, the entire text is utterly insignificant, since, let us not forget, the tone on illegal immigration was set at the June 2002 summit in Seville. The decision was effectively taken, notably under French pressure from President Chirac, not to take any enforcement measures against the countries of origin of illegal immigrants.

 The Redondo Jiménez report provides a precise account of the state of our forests but does not, unfortunately, propose practical solutions either for protecting them or for ensuring that they are monitored. As an elected representative of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region, I was appalled by the forest fires which, this summer, destroyed more than 60 000 hectares of land in France, mainly in the Var and Haute-Corse administrative departments. It turns out that the vast majority of these fires are of criminal origin. Penal sanctions against the arsonists and those behind such acts should therefore be strengthened. Everyone involved, all of whom have also agreed upon the need to step up prevention and to strengthen the protection of forests as a national heritage that we have to administer jointly, wants to see the criminalisation of these acts. We also believe that human activities carried on in our forests need to be considered a public service of general interest and that, given their non-profitability, they therefore need to be supported financially. Forest owners should also be offered tax breaks and financial incentives to encourage them to clear brushwood and carry out maintenance work. ‘Private forester-firefighters’ could do this work. There we have a genuine environmental policy. I should like to conclude by asking a question : will France, like Portugal, be entitled to aid from the new European Solidarity Fund?

 Instead of being concerned with security, the text now before us seeks to regulate the conditions of transit for persons residing illegally within Union territory and subject to an expulsion order. Already rejected in April and referred back to committee, this proposal for a directive has clearly caused an outcry amongst the far left, the greens and the third world activists for one simple reason: it is immoral and inhumane to expel illegally-residing foreigners to their country of origin! Consequently, these individuals do not hesitate, in the minority opinion appended to Mr Kirkhope’s report, to express their horror and denounce fortress Europe and even the deportation mechanisms illustrating the cynicism of a racist policy that places state interests above people's interests in a better life. This might appear to be funny but the fact is that we are sick and tired of hearing endless repetitions of all these speeches stuffed with human rights diatribes, these fine sentiments which mean that throughout Europe today, we are seeing the same things, such as uncontrolled immigration and States that are swamped and no longer know what to do with their illegal immigrants and whose only solution is to open temporary accommodation centres, which are temporary in name only.

 Europe is now, once again, demonstrating its mastery of the art of the paradox. Whilst on the one hand it destroys our agriculture by dismantling the CAP and the system of direct aid to farmers, it suggests in this report, that priority should be given to family farming and to support for small and medium-sized holdings, to stepping up actions to promote rural development and even to protecting women on farms and in the EU’s rural areas. Unfortunately it appears that, at a time when the death of our farming is pre-ordained – this is why all farming unions condemn the CAP reform that will come into force in 2005 – the wishes of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities will remain pious hopes. This report rightly condemns the ageing of the female farming population, the low number of women who have the status of spouse-partner or assistant, which puts them in an extremely difficult situation with regard to their pay, their social security, their care under the medical system, their retirement and their professional development. The report also notes the high unemployment rate in farming regions. (Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)

I have to admit that this report already has one merit: it amused me. The title, ‘Women and Sport’, might itself have been confusing, but the content is entirely beyond comprehension! I have read and reread this crazy report and I have still not grasped the ins and outs of it. I did pick out some classic passages, on access to sport as a fundamental right, on sport as a highly sexual and stereotyped area where the dominant models of virility and femininity are reproduced but also broken, and on socially discriminatory and sexually stereotyped treatment by the media, which leave us speechless. But no, I can definitely find no justification for this report other than enabling an MEP to indulge in a style exercise that is worthy of the greatest humorists, So after ‘Women and Sport’ roll on a report on ‘Sport and sexual minorities’! Who was it who said that ‘in politics, talking without saying anything and not saying anything for the sake of talking are the two major principles of those who would be better to keep their mouths closed’?

 Mr President, the proposals presented to us aim to encourage further the entry of immigrants into the European Union. The most obvious example of this is the last report concerning the right to family reunification, the Fourtou report, in which the concept of family had become unrecognisable, such was the extent to which it had been extended and denatured. In its frenzy to allow needy foreigners from all over the world into a Europe that it would like to be respectful of human rights and to have a humanist, not to say humanitarian, vocation, the Commission is planning the death of nations by drowning and suffocation. It should be noted, however, that this report, even though it supplements the measures that have already been presented with regard to immigration for the purposes of employment and family reunification, does not take the same approach. It concerns students and school pupils who would enter the Union in order to study. In this regard, nonetheless, we need to establish the length of stay, methods of monitoring their studies, and procedures for non-renewal of the student residence permit. This exchange and this form of cooperation between Europe and third countries is clearly a source of intellectual enrichment between students of the country of origin and the host country. Should we not, however, devote our efforts more to aid to development in less advantaged countries, in order to allow these countries to train their elite at home and keep them there, in order to prevent brain drain, which, unfortunately for them, is often inevitable? Of course, this would require a genuine cooperation policy with disadvantaged third countries and a sea change in immigration policy in Brussels. Sadly, we are far from achieving this.
