Madam President, Mr Sonik had a long and complex task, and overall we should welcome his report. However, it is clear that there are still many doubts about extraction of shale gas and oil. The other speeches we have heard also share this view, in particular with regard to environmental and public health protection. I therefore welcome the series of studies undertaken by the European Commission on potential risks resulting from shale gas extraction. Only on the basis of their results will we be able to give a clear answer and be in a position to adopt a new EU framework Directive for regulating mining activities. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, this proposal for a regulation aims to simplify the current legal framework and to establish new administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, of which there are currently around 30 million in Europe. Until now, the 2002 Framework Directive and 14 other directives referring to it set out the requirements in a rather convoluted legislative framework that is happily being replaced by a consolidated text. A refined vehicle categorisation achieved by introducing more appropriate subcategories, more severe emission limits, the mandatory introduction of anti-lock brake systems on some types of vehicle and the automatic headlight-on system to improve the visibility of L-vehicles are just some of the innovations to be introduced thanks to this report. The benefits to be gained in terms of safety, environmental protection and improved functioning of the internal market are beyond doubt and because of this I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 In a parliamentary democracy, the link between the public nature of debates and votes, and democratic accountability, is inescapable. If we do not give European citizens the ability to know what their elected representatives have said and how they voted, I wonder whether they will be able to hold them to account at the next elections. The review of Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure, through the incorporation of some key elements of the Code of conduct for negotiating in the context of the ordinary legislative procedures in the binding part of the Rules, will make the procedures more effective, more transparent and above all more inclusive. I am convinced that the excellent job done and the measures the report contains will increase transparency and therefore the accountability of the elected representatives at European level.

 The present situation demands a strong response from Parliament in terms of both efficiency and financial savings. The statistics for 2011 show that no Member has ever requested the translation of the entire verbatim report of proceedings in his or her own language. This was a pointless, superfluous expense that should quite rightly be restricted. I fully agree with the solutions explained in the report and with the work done by Mr Ilchev. In particular, the database from which citizens can watch all the video recordings translated into all the official languages is certainly an effective solution for preserving European multilingualism.

 A Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) on 29 April 2008 between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, was signed in Luxembourg. The Commission has proposed an Implementing Regulation to facilitate the application of the Interim Agreement, which lays down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements. Mr Winkler felt that the amendments to the Commission proposal under examination should mirror the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I report. I agree with the rapporteur because this will guarantee the consistency and coherence of the European Parliament’s position on the matter. Consequently the report contains amendments aimed at aligning the amended provisions with the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I Regulation to the five Regulations on the application of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements with the other Western Balkan countries. I fully agree with Mr Winkler’s report, and that is why I have decided to give it my full support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The right of a citizen of an unrepresented Member State to seek assistance from the consular authorities of other Member States that are represented is one of the rights conferred by EU citizenship. It is a right that has existed for some years, but European citizens are still not fully informed of it. As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am more than satisfied with the work done on this report. I believe that the measures adopted will improve the enforcement of this right, through better coordination between Member States on consular representation. The only doubt that remains is how these new measures will be publicised among European citizens. I think that a coordinated campaign of information at European level could be the most effective way of achieving the results we hope for. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr La Via on his excellent work on the report on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013. His task was difficult, and there seemed little likelihood of an agreement between the Member States and the European Parliament. Despite the prolonged period of crisis and constant requests for cuts to EU expenditure, Mr La Via and Mr Vaughan together managed to ensure continuity for current policies and initiatives. I think it was particularly important that any slowing down of the pilot projects in the areas of energy and the environment was avoided, a clear sign of the good work carried out by the European Parliament in defending the prerogatives of the European Union. I have therefore given my full support to this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with I would like to recall that the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 are proceeding in a very difficult social, economic and financial context. I regret to say that the European Union is increasingly seen by citizens as an additional burden to be borne by taxpayers, rather than an important resource. I am convinced that this situation is caused by the fact that the EU budget is not in line with national budgets, since it has not been expanded to take account of the duties and competencies assigned to the Union under the Treaty of Lisbon, or of the important political Decisions taken by the European Council. I voted in favour of the report because I was aware of the need to reach an interinstitutional compromise and to send a clear signal to citizens. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Commission’s proposal to amend Article 103o of the Single CMO Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007), which provides for the possibility for Member States to grant decoupled aid to vine growers under the single payment scheme (SPS), definitely needed to be amended. I endorse Mr Dorfmann’s work and the proposals he put forward, as they ensure farmers receive predictable payments of aid. The report also effectively confronts the current changing situation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. Above all, it was important to avoid Member States planning five-year decisions that are actually not compatible with the Commission’s proposal for a new system of direct support, just as it was essential to link the calendar for the final transfer decision to the calendar of the future reform. All these problems were considered in the report and the solutions reached are very positive. This is why I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has been in use since 2008 as a free service to Member States with a view to improving the exchange of information within the internal market. To date, the IMI system still operates on the basis of a Commission decision and a Commission recommendation and, as a result, lacks a single legal instrument. This has been a major obstacle to further expansion of the IMI system, which should have been overcome long ago. We have seen that the system has worked perfectly with regard to the Professional Qualifications Directive and the Services Directive. The system has proven its value as a rapid and secure means for cross-border information exchange and administrative cooperation with currently over 6 000 registered authorities in all EU Member States and EEA (European Economic Area) countries. Therefore, I welcome the report’s proposals and I hope that the expansion in IMI application to other sectors will have clear benefits for citizens and for the internal market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation No 73/2009, which provides the rules for the current system of direct payments to farmers, will be superseded by other proposals under the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform for 2014-2020 In its proposals for the multiannual financial framework and the CAP for 2014-2020, the Commission is proposing to make use of a new crisis reserve to address additional financing needs resulting from unexpected agricultural crises. The net ceiling in 2013 for EU Member States would be equal to the value of the net ceiling in 2012, with the adjustments deriving from grubbing-up in 2012 and the appraised transfer of the wine envelopes to the single payment scheme. I agree with the solution contained in the report and therefore I voted in favour of Mr Capoulas Santos’s proposal, because I think we need to maintain the current financial structure for 2013 in order to ensure continued levels of payments and to support agricultural development in an effective way. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting animal welfare standards is part of and complementary to sustainable development policy. European institutions, as signatories to the agreement on sustainable development, must do all they can to ensure these standards are adequate. The deterioration in the state of health of wild animals could result in an increased spread of contagious diseases to domestic animals and, at the same time, have an adverse effect on public health; I voted in favour of Ms Paulsen’s proposal, since I think the current regulations need to be better enforced, with special focus on the animal transport sector. I welcome the inclusion in the strategy of a European animal welfare framework law and join in Ms Paulsen’s call for this law to be clearly formulated, followed by a consultation with all relevant parties.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until now, the Commission has been financing programmes such as MED 2007-2013 and the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument for cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Now that the 2007-2013 financial programming period is coming to an end, I think we need to ask the Commission to start a process of dialogue and consultation in order to define future macro-regional strategies. Priority areas to be targeted by future support still have to be identified, and that must be done while taking into account the need to strengthen existing cooperation, particularly between areas of Europe belonging to different Member States but sharing the same services and working area. I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s motion for a resolution because I consider the Mediterranean to be a coherent whole, a single cultural and environmental area in which joint priorities such as crops, renewable energy sources and tourism can be shared.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a single European railway area provides a major opportunity to support economic recovery and make the single market more competitive. The variety of national railway systems hampers this process: numerous legislative barriers slow down development in the sector and limit the competitiveness of rail transport. We should establish transparent rules on access to rail-related services and service facilities, such as freight terminals, maintenance facilities and marshalling yards. Ms Serracchiani’s report is a step in that direction, and that is why I voted for it. The Council is calling for too long a period – up to 36 months – for this new directive to enter into force. Accordingly, I endorse the rapporteur’s request to set a period of 12 months for the transposition of the entire directive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by improving the harmonised control of driving time and rest periods, digital tachographs can play a vital role in ensuring that the internal road haulage market functions properly, which will greatly benefit road safety. A number of recent police reports from certain Member States have shown that fraudulent use of these devices has risen, and therefore a change to the regulation in force is urgently required. According to the Commission, the increased cost of purchasing a new tachograph is expected to be around EUR 5 per vehicle, which is negligible compared with the potential benefits that could accrue. I voted in favour of Ms Ţicău’s proposal because I believe tachographs and vehicle satellite tracking systems should be synchronised to make services more efficient and more reliable. The ability to transmit tachograph data remotely will also lead to better control and a substantial improvement in road safety. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we look back at some of the serious environmental disasters we are all familiar with, we can see that there have been numerous cases where disastrous environmental consequences have followed industrial accidents. These cases also show that at times the impact of accidents can extend beyond national borders. I have voted in favour of my fellow Member’s proposal since I believe Directive 96/82/EC must be replaced so that the existing protection levels are not only maintained, but strengthened. I also think that the new provisions should be clearer, consistent and easily understandable, in order to contribute to the streamlining of administrative procedures. Finally, I would argue it is necessary to keep a certain amount of flexibility to be able to amend Annex I to deal with any unwanted effects of the alignment to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and any subsequent adjustments to that regulation that could have an impact on the classification of dangerous substances.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses establishes general provisions regarding the composition and manufacture of said foods. This directive’s provisions mostly date back to 1977 and no longer meet the needs of today's consumers. Therefore an in-depth revision of the directive was needed and for this reason I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s proposal. I would still argue that it is absolutely necessary to protect consumers more, simplify regulations and tackle the difficulties that Member States and operators encounter in interpreting the various existing pieces of food legislation. This would mean similar products could be treated in the same way throughout the Union, creating a level playing field for all internal market operators and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and end-consumers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to the development of the economy and society. However, to make the most of these potentials, first they need to be made secure. The many disputes regarding existing legislation on data privacy and intellectual property rights enforced in the Internet environment should give us much food for thought. I supported Mr Kalfin’s proposal because I believe that the potential offered by the web, in terms of both innovation and growth for European enterprises, must not be lost, especially in a highly competitive context such as currently exists at global level. Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that I believe in the need for a rapid implementation of the European programme for critical information infrastructure protection (ECIP), including the creation of the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to climate change, the steady rise in environmental pollution, industrialisation and the increasing population growth, we are facing global energy challenges. I believe it would be useful to strengthen the external dimension of EU energy policy by taking a clear stance on the diversification of energy sources and routes. I voted in favour of Ms Herczog’s proposal because I think it is essential to guarantee security of supply and, at the same time, to support sustainable production and consumption. I firmly hope, however, that in the future, we will have greater coordination between Member States’ policies and joint action and solidarity in the field of external energy policy and energy security. In this respect, we must recognise the importance of transparency and implementation of the internal energy market. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted for this resolution in the belief that introducing new taxes will not, in itself, solve our problems; nevertheless, the introduction of certain taxes may lead to a reduction in taxation in other sectors. The financial sector is not contributing in a fair way to the cost of the global crisis at a time when EU citizens are faced with an increase in direct and indirect taxation and severe cuts in wages and pensions. The financial sector is still exempted from taxation in its activities and transactions. I therefore support Ms Podimata’s proposal, which envisages a taxation rate of 0.1% in respect of transactions other than those related to derivatives arrangements, and 0.01% in respect of transactions related to derivatives arrangements, which would generate new revenues of EUR 57 billion at EU level. I have one final comment to make: I would point out that, according to a Eurobarometer poll carried out in June 2011, a large majority of EU citizens are in favour of bringing in these measures. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the single market was conceived as a vital tool for steering Europe towards sustainable growth and full employment. If fully developed, it could provide a useful antidote to the economic crisis that has gripped Europe and the world for several years now. To that end, its supporting directives need to be properly transposed, applied and implemented. I therefore agree with Mr Busuttil’s proposals, which emphasise the need to implement these directives in order to be able to exploit the single market’s economic potential. The SOLVIT network has been shown to be a useful, effective tool for providing clear, timely solutions for citizens and businesses, thus helping to solve the problems associated with the misapplication of competition rules. As a non-judicial entity, the network is ideally placed to operate economically and effectively. I therefore hope that SOLVIT will be further reinforced and promoted to European citizens.

 Mr President, despite Turkey’s recent efforts and progress, culminating in the meeting between the Turkish Minister for Family and Social Policies and representatives from the Committee on Equal Opportunities, a number of important outstanding gender equality issues remain. Given that Turkey is a candidate country, the present gap will have to be bridged completely for it to be able to achieve current European Union standards. I am concerned, in particular, by the recent data on the safety and protection of women. It emerges that 39% of Turkish women have been attacked at least once in their lives. I agree with Mr Bozkurt’s proposal to encourage the Turkish Government to act swiftly to implement the measures needed to reduce the number of attacks. Finally, I would like to stress the importance of access to information and to education in ensuring gender mainstreaming at all educational levels. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the potential afforded by the new channels of communication is huge. In a world in which everything is digital, information is an asset for every European citizen. The European Union needs to protect all end users and try to reduce the existing disparities between Member States on the European market to a minimum. I would like to point out that, as the promoter of a single internal market, the European Union must also implement an internal telecommunications market. The significant differences between domestic and roaming prices obviously make these difficult goals to meet. I agree with Ms Niebler’s proposal. Each home provider must give customers clear and adequate information about the levels of consumption they have reached and agreed. Transparent information about the conclusion of contracts and the charges for data roaming services will be an appropriate means for protecting European consumers and I therefore voted in favour of the report.

 The European Union has a crucial role in European environmental policy. By signing Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, entering into the Rotterdam Convention, the EU has set itself the goal of incentivising and increasing information exchange about the chemicals traded between the parties to the convention and also to implement the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. The measure ensures that exporting countries of chemicals formally obtain consent from the importing countries before the export can take place. Mr Jørgensen’s proposal aims to limit the derogations usually adopted against the PIC procedure, thereby trying to defend the original meaning of the Convention. The joint intervention of the Commission and the designated national authorities will also be of significant help. This synergy will undoubtedly result in more accurate and reliable documentation on the possible impact on human health or the environment of using dangerous chemical substances in the importing country or another exporting country.

 Despite the fact that the situation in Myanmar is still far from what international institutions – the European Union in the first place – expect for the future, the progress achieved by the nation under the leadership of President Thein Sein can be seen by one and all. A political process has begun that has given rise to a series of radical changes: the satisfactory outcome of the by-elections held on 1 April; the release of a significant number of political prisoners; the adoption of a series of legislative and governmental measures aimed at increasing openness, from the initiation of economic reforms to the easing of press and Internet censorship and the promulgation of laws on freedom of association and the freedom to strike; and the initiation of a process of dialogue with the main ethnic groups. While recognising the still undeveloped context in which this process of opening and national reconciliation is taking place, the transition from a military to a civilian government and the democratic opposition’s possibility to be represented are basic aspects. Finally, I would like to emphasise that, in this sense, it was the firm diplomatic actions of Italy, Germany and France that led to the gradual easing of EU sanctions and to a gradual evolution of political and democratic structures in Burma.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps there has been an error in communication, but I had asked to speak to explain my vote. In the past decade we have witnessed a series of well-known dramatic events which have led to a consequent increase in the number of controls and restrictions in air travel. Meanwhile, the European Union, the USA, Canada and Australia have signed a variety of international agreements on the processing and storage of passenger data. Parliament already expressed its willingness to revise such agreements in May 2010, when it decided to reject the outcome of the negotiations between the countries involved. I am aware of the fact that the competent parliamentary committee has judged this agreement unsuitable, nonetheless I think it is more useful to maintain this new agreement, rather than referring to the current legislation. Since it is not possible to start new negotiations, it would be better to adopt these new measures and improve the previous framework with regard to data protection and the respect for individual rights. The rejection of these new results would deprive Europe of any minimum law in this field, and of any effective tool in combating terrorism and organised crime. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its Member States have always promoted sustainable development and the protection of the environment and human health. The signing of the Kyoto Protocol and the Europe 2020 strategy are among the most important challenges that the EU has set itself. Taxation related to CO2
 emissions is a cost-effective means for Member States to achieve the reductions of greenhouse gasses necessary according to Decision 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. I am in favour of Ms Lulling’s proposal on the need to ensure that the internal market functions in an optimum manner in a context of new requirements relating to the limitation of climate change, to the use of renewable energy sources and to energy savings. Consistent treatment of energy sources should be guaranteed in order to provide a genuine level playing field for energy consumers regardless of the energy source used. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the approval of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World and the resolution on the EU’s support for the International Criminal Court, the European Parliament voted to act in a manner consistent and in conformity with EU obligations concerning the protection of human rights. Implementing national strategies already drawn up in recent months will be an important step in this direction. I agree with Mr Howitt’s proposal to call on the Commission to insert a ‘torture end-use’ clause into the 2005 Council Regulation concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture, etc. This would enable Member States to acquire detailed information and decide whether or not to refuse the export of the goods and substances in question.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have witnessed fast economic growth on the part of Azerbaijan, whose economic potential is obvious to all. We must also recognise that there has been a strengthening of the strategic role of that country as an Eastern partner, in particular, in the energy sector. However, we must remember here that the gap in terms of democracy and the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights compared to the standards required by the European Union has not yet been completely bridged. I believe that these principles should be considered essential for the proper conduct of the negotiations and the stipulation of an association agreement with Azerbaijan. I hope that the Council and the Commission will be urging the Azerbaijani authorities to adopt an anti-discriminatory legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Meanwhile, we should welcome the reforms made by the Azerbaijani authorities in the judiciary in the last year, which should ensure greater independence of judges, and eliminate corruption in this area.

 The principal aim of cohesion policy and of the policy on the internal market is to organise policy initiatives directed towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, encouraging an economy with a high rate of employment that favours social and territorial cohesion. Nevertheless, the initial conditions in which the outermost regions (ORs) find themselves present an obstacle to, and a brake on, achieving the objectives that have been set, in particular, in the Europe 2020 strategy. As the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides, the ORs have a right to be treated differently, which enables them to benefit from the maximum level of aid, irrespective of their level of development. In this sense, I welcome the Commission’s plan to include a budget line for ‘Outermost regions and regions with a very low population density’ in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. I fully agree with the advisability of outermost regions pursuing the main objectives defined in the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I consider that we must emphasise the need to modulate the objectives in accordance with each outermost region’s own situation, taking into account their regional diversity, their structural conditions and their potential benefits.

 The current economic and financial crisis in Europe calls for the adoption of robust, decisive measures to stimulate economic growth. Of course, tax revenue is one of the most important tools with which the Member States can tackle the problems associated with the crisis. I warmly welcome the proposal put forward by Mr Casa. I think that it is essential to create a European fiscal union that includes a comprehensive, rapid, efficient and user friendly exchange of information among Member States in order to improve the fight against tax evasion and to optimise the revenue paid into Member States’ coffers. I hope that we can rise above partisan positions and that common sense will prevail at this difficult time. We must come to an agreement and find new resources in order to deal with the crisis.

 Respect for, and the defence of, human rights and democratic values are the fundamental principles on which the European Union is based. Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: ‘In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women’. On 7 July 2011, the European Parliament welcomed the initiative of establishing the European Endowment for Democracy, as did subsequently the Foreign Affairs Council. I agree with this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation, and I urge the Council to outline the methods for its creation. I believe that establishment of the Endowment could be a tangible and practical response by the European Union to the challenges posed by countries calling for greater democracy. I hope that this can take place as soon as possible, also in view of the timing imposed on us by the ‘Arab Spring’. The situation of instability afflicting the Middle East is clear and before our eyes, and we have to respond to it. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The inclusion of Kosovo in the stabilisation and association process (SAP), thanks to which it could benefit from EU assistance (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, IPA) and an independent preferential trade system, would ensure that Kosovo does not remain on the sidelines of the EU’s strategy in the area of the Western Balkans. In its communication of October 2011 on the enlargement strategy, the Commission showed how the post-election period of adjustment prevented Kosovo from making substantial progress in terms of reforms. On the other hand, in its conclusions of 5 December 2011, the Council called upon Kosovo to implement the actions decided on to compensate for these failings. I agree and support the Commission’s intention to carry out a feasibility study for the stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Kosovo. This commitment confirms the wish and commitment of the EU to carry forward the initiatives outlined in the General Affairs Council conclusions of December 2011 and, at the same time, shows that it can make a significant contribution in socio-political terms, which will be essential for reaching an agreement between Priština and Belgrade on the delicate issue of regional cooperation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before my explanation of vote, I would like to explain that I am wearing this T-shirt because I would like to ask the European Union to take decisive steps to secure the liberation of the two Italian soldiers, Captain Massimiliano Latorre and Sergeant Salvatore Girone, who have been unjustly detained for doing their duty against piracy. Mr President, the new general guidelines of the European Parliament on the 2013 budget will define the guidelines, objectives and strategies to be followed by the Commission when preparing the draft budget. The report in question sets out the key points for reviving the European economy in the light of the effects of, and the issues caused by, the ongoing nature of the economic crisis. I welcome the initiative not just because it makes the EU budget an ideal vehicle for encouraging cohesion between Member States, but also because it embodies an opportunity to review and adapt the new budget to the needs of the economic crisis that has hit the euro area. The initiative proposed by Mr La Via has my full support, and I especially welcome the request made to the Council not to make artificial cuts that do not take into account the effective absorption capacity of the programmes and consequently delay the implementation of cohesion policies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I travelled personally to Macedonia during the last presidential elections as an envoy of the Group of the European People’s Party (PPE) in order to support Prime Minister Gruevski’s electoral campaign. Having met thousands of people, I was able to observe personally that it is not just the institutions but also the people who are decisively in favour of joining the European Union. This is why I believe we cannot put off starting negotiations, which have been suspended, for much longer, and should resume them as a matter of urgency. The 2011 progress report presented by the Commission shows that for the third consecutive year, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has managed to maintain positive progress in line with European standards in terms of political criteria and the development of a market economy. Therefore, I am confident that FYROM will manage to overcome the political and structural limitations that are still holding it back, and give my full support to the resumption of negotiations.

 The recent instalment of the new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 10 February brought an end to the political stalemate that had been created in the country and had stunted its development. This provides an excellent foundation for reviving the European agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among the most significant actions taken by the new government, I should like to point out the initiatives to bring in a census, the adoption of the laws on State aid and the adaptation of the country’s constitution to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I support the motion tabled by Ms Pack: we must urge the Bosnian authorities to make further efforts and take further steps to meet the EU accession criteria. That said, I think it is essential that Bosnia and Herzegovina complies with the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the Sejdić-Finci case and with Article 2 of the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA), which give greater guarantees on human rights and democratic principles. The decision to dissolve the local office of the High Representative is quite correct and I think it will promote a greater sense of responsibility among the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999, with the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European signatory countries committed to working together to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. This target would have guaranteed academic quality, economic development and social cohesion, and employment and lifelong learning for graduates. I support Mr Berlinguer’s report because it calls for decisive and coordinated action at European level. The recognition of degrees based on an efficient system of quality assurance constitutes a good point of departure for encouraging Member States to adopt the national framework of qualifications for lifelong learning. It is essential to implement and develop a European system of higher education that allows and encourages the free movement of knowledge. I think the measures contained in the report represent the right path to follow to make Europe more productive and competitive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that currently, 1.5 billion people in the world are unable to access energy sources. Globally, forecasts indicate that over the next two decades, the funds allocated to energy will amount to USD 26 trillion – just 3% of that sum would ensure universal access to energy by 2030. The proposal put forward by Mr Neuser concerning the possibility of developing and extending access to modern energy services should be a starting point for the EU to begin to address the problem of poverty and sustainable development through targeted, effective action.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented by Mr Schmidt, which is the Commission’s first initiative in the area of tax, makes a positive contribution to outlining future legislative initiatives on this issue. Nevertheless, I believe that targeted interventions on national taxation policies are needed. In this regard, the Commission’s intention to strengthen the legal framework on savings taxation and the review of taxation on energy products is a positive step. Although Member States have expressed diverging opinions on the validity and efficacy of this initiative, overall, I welcome Mr Schmidt’s report and this is why I decided to support it. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schwab’s report shows how EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits for consumers. The use of flexible, dynamic procedures has enabled competition policy to act as a driver and not as an obstacle to the European financial and economic system. I voted in favour of the report as I fully agree with the objectives contained in it. In particular, I support the aim of improving price transparency in order to stimulate competition in the market and protect consumer rights. At a time of recession, we absolutely have to try and incentivise consumers. Finally, I would like to add that the information exchange between the Commission and consumer associations should continue and be stepped up and extended to stakeholders. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The reluctance of Member States to take steps to harmonise some aspects of their respective systems of procedural law does no good for the States themselves or, above all, for European citizens. The ‘by stages’ approach adopted by the Commission is proving to be a winning strategy. However, I think Parliament ought to make itself heard before the Council in order to try and speed up the process for adopting the other directives in this area. Having to talk, in 2011, about rules on the entitlement of suspected and accused persons to be informed of their rights and of the charge against them in criminal proceedings within EU Member States seems, to say the least, like something of an anachronism.

 The legislative vacuum in the EU on protecting victims of crime from further attacks once the victims have left their Member State of origin was a serious and unacceptable flaw in a united Europe. The European Union is not merely about the single market and economic interests; this report is one demonstration of that fact. The solutions in the proposal will, at long last, allow victims of violence to benefit from a guaranteed level of protection that is the same as in the Member State that granted the measures. I completely agree with the report by Ms Barrio and Ms López and therefore voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 I would like to congratulate Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes for their work, both earlier on the parliamentary committee and on the Conciliation Committee. While I understand the Council’s reasons, the situation the Member State economies were in required an austerity-based response, and in this sense, the compromise agreement we have reached is a satisfactory solution. I share Commissioner Lewandowski’s doubts, but I would like to reiterate that the possibility of adopting an amending budget at a later date, should it not be possible to meet the payments, has rightly been included in the joint statement by the Parliament and the Council. Finally, I am pleased that we have managed to honour our promises on the immigration policy appropriations. We cannot predict what repercussions the political situation in the Maghreb may have, and we must be prepared and in possession of the right tools to deal with any emergency. Therefore, I hope the subject can be the subject of debate in this House. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe and its history speak through the huge achievements that have distinguished the development of civilisation in our countries. Much of Europe’s history is told through the roads, the monuments and the convents that, in times of darkness, have given dignity to the journey of the peoples of Europe. I support the stance taken in this measure which, naturally, perhaps ought to be extended to the countries waiting to join the EU, the Western Balkan countries, because I think it would be a good idea to involve them in this project of identifying a European brand. I think their involvement would send out a positive message to them. I am delighted that this measure has been adopted today by a broad majority and this further assures me that the Council cannot throw up further obstacles to its swift approval.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the railway sector has always been something of a special case, where the competitive ethos of the single market and the European Union has taken root rather late. The deficiencies in the services that this sector offers to citizens are linked precisely to this lateness. I am convinced that more transparent and smoother conditions for accessing the market, together with explicit rules on conflicts of interest and discriminatory practices in the railway sector, will be the right measures to spur on greater competition. I completely agree with the legislative proposal on the complete, mandatory separation between infrastructure managers and businesses operating the transport services, namely train companies. I invite the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on this within the pre-established timeframes. I believe that the measures contained in the report will allow us to make it easier to provide train services, boosting the quality offered to passengers and people using freight services. Ms Serrachiani’s report provides tangible responses to the request for greater liberalisation and competition in the railway sector and accordingly I have given it my full support.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s motion is a bold step in the right direction. Despite the austerity required by the Member States and by the domestic budget deficits, the European Union is duty bound to do everything it can to ensure growth and employment in Europe. I completely agree with Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes and therefore voted in favour of the resolution. The crisis must not be tackled solely through austerity measures, but also through investment in research and in the cohesion policy. Administrative costs must be kept in check and Parliament has sent out a clear and firm message on this. I hope, however, that good sense will prevail in the next meeting of the Conciliation Committee. The Council must open its eyes and realise that cutting competitiveness and cohesion will only sink our economy even deeper into the mire. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, although it is important to reduce the emission of gaseous pollutants and pollutants produced by internal combustion engines in non-road mobile machinery, we cannot turn a blind eye to the current situation in which manufacturers find themselves. Since 2008, the financial and economic crisis has hit the non-road mobile machinery sector hard. It was essential for us to further extend the flexibility scheme for the transition from Stage III A to Stage III B. The increase in the number of engines used for application in land-based machines under the flexibility scheme, from 20% to 37.5%, is, in my opinion, an unsatisfactory result for European industry in this sector. However, given the situation and Parliament’s continual delays, manufacturers were demanding a rapid response. I would like to specify that it is for this reason alone that I decided to support the report with my vote. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, fully agree with the general approach of Ms Rühle’s report, and I therefore voted in favour. I am convinced that the measures adopted will provide legal certainty, on the one hand, and clearer rules and more flexible procedures for public procurement, on the other. I endorse Ms Rühle’s view that it is the public procurement directives themselves which are the main impediment to involving public contracting authorities in the pursuit of general social aims: the criterion of the lowest price cannot carry the same weight as that of the most economically advantageous tender. It must be stipulated that contracts are to be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender. Only then will the criteria for selecting what is most economically advantageous be easier to implement. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, European consumers’ confidence in the financial system has been severely tested in the last few months, and the Belgian case is clear evidence of this. I am convinced that the system of compensating the potential losses of consumers in the event of bankruptcy of financial institutions or insurance companies, together with insurance guarantee schemes, could make a precious contribution to reducing the risks of policyholders and beneficiaries. I voted in favour of this report. However, I would like to emphasise that, until now, European consumers have not had access to sufficient information in cases of insurance company insolvency. This information must be easily accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible, but, above all, consumers must be clearly told which authority they can apply to should they need to claim compensation.

 Madam President, the legal mechanism devised as a temporary solution for adapting the value-added tax (VAT) system to the abolition of the internal borders is showing its limitations and shortcomings. There is a high level of exposure to fraud, a problem that must be solved as soon as possible. Furthermore, if we think about the considerable increase in commercial transactions between tradespeople based in different Member States and about the rise in the provision of cross-border services, reform of the VAT system appears obvious and inevitable. I voted for Mr Casa’s report, but I still believe that the reverse charge mechanism needs to be explored further. In particular, we are not currently able to forecast what the effects would be of concentrating the financial risk exclusively on the retailer. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we have been able to establish which new and important powers have been granted to the European Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Commission’s proposals for improved economic governance are crucially important for our economic growth and, in particular, for that of the countries in the euro area. The improvements made by the European Parliament with a view to the creation of a robust and coherent legislative framework are clear. I support the general approach of this report, and accordingly voted in favour of it. We have new responsibilities to shoulder; the package of measures must be further improved and enhanced. I believe that we should focus more on preventing unsustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies, but above all that Parliament should be given a prominent role in the surveillance process, with regular, systematic debates and public hearings held in Parliament itself. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what clearly emerges from this report is that many European regions find it difficult to administer the Structural Funds made available by the Union through its cohesion policies. They often find themselves caught in a maze in which, if the regions succeed in organising the administration of these funds, it is often the national governments that then find it difficult to activate the cofinancing funds. Sometimes it is like a dog chasing its own tail: the money that we consider fundamental for growth and cohesion in Europe cannot then be spent, as it now appears is happening in my own country, Italy, as well. I have therefore voted in favour of this report, but I believe that, on the one hand, we should speed up the adoption of the new economic programming period 2014-2020 to enable the individual Member States and regions of Europe to prepare themselves in time and, on the other, that the cofinancing mechanism should perhaps be reviewed. That could be a way forward and so I have voted in favour, but I think a lot more needs to be done to ensure that European funds can actually be spent to benefit the people. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report shows that the social cost of road accidents is enormous, standing at an estimated EUR 130 billion per year. Mr Koch’s proposals are along the right lines and I particularly support the idea of creating the role of EU road safety coordinator. However, I think that we do need to come up with targets and measures that are far more ambitious than those put forward by the Commission thus far; above all, I think that Parliament ought to make its presence felt to the Commission. We cannot accept the fact that in recent years, the European Union’s budget for road safety measures has been slashed. We are therefore duty-bound to ensure that this trend is reversed as soon as possible and that road safety receives greater funding. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forecasts in Mr Caspary’s report on gross domestic product and export growth in the European Union are truly disheartening. We cannot continue to plan our commercial strategy on the premise that the current situation in international trade will remain. The Global Europe strategy has been a failure and I think that the Commission ought to investigate the reasons behind this. We need critical and detailed analysis, but especially an overview of how to deal with future economic challenges. The commercial policy must be coordinated with the European Union’s other economic policies, but, above all, it needs to be accompanied by a parallel policy to combat the phenomenon of population decline. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced countless innovations, including one which in my view deserves greater attention: the Protocol on the role of national parliaments. In the Protocol, national parliaments are called upon to actively uphold the principle of subsidiarity during the legislative process. I voted in favour of this report. Nevertheless, I wish to stress that, so far, very little has been done. Applying this Protocol would meet our citizens’ need, albeit only in part, for democratic legitimacy, and overcome that feeling of remoteness which surrounds the European institutions. I think that a need felt so keenly by our citizens deserves greater attention. I therefore hope that further measures are adopted as soon as possible. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only endorse the text of this report. Mr Meyer has rightly highlighted the need to create a European one-stop shop. The creation of such facilities remains the main goal yet to be achieved. However, the statistics in the report clearly show that there is a significant lack of information at European level, not only with regard to the public’s right of petition, but also in terms of the so-called informal mechanisms. For example, SOLVIT has shown that it works properly, swiftly and effectively, but this has not changed the fact that our fellow citizens only marginally avail themselves of this service. I wonder whether it would not be more appropriate to organise a media campaign at European level on these topics instead of merely improving the Parliament website, which is an important communication tool, but which does not reach every citizen at the moment. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around half of all CO2 
emission-intensive industrial projects in developing countries have some form of export credit agency support. These projects usually present a high environmental and social risk. Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the scale of this phenomenon, since the agencies themselves have no data or rules on transparency of information. This situation is completely at odds with our environmental policy. I wonder whether it would not be worth looking at the scale of this phenomenon in more depth. Mandatory risk calculations are a first step. However, even clearer rules are needed in order to direct these forms of financial support towards the carbon reduction target that we have set ourselves. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by Mr Bütikofer. The EU needs a strong industrial base on which to grow, and this cannot be achieved without an adequate supply of raw materials. Once again, we are being penalised because there is no common aim at international level. How can we dream of asserting our interests when dealing with countries such as China without a cohesive European Union? I am convinced that European raw materials diplomacy is the right solution to the supply crisis. I hope that the adopted proposals will be acted on and that the role of the European External Action Service will gradually be strengthened in the near future. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union specifies that the regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework shall be adopted by the Council after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Article 312(5) requires the three institutions to work together to find a solution ‘throughout the procedure leading to the adoption of the financial framework’, i.e. prior negotiation is required. As Mr Böge stated in his report, this negotiation has not taken place. The Council asked Parliament simply for approval, with no attempt to reach a common solution. Not even Parliament’s wish for greater flexibility has been addressed by the Council. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that Parliament cannot consent to this proposal for a draft Council regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. I hope that for all future proposals, this institution’s voice will be heard, as, moreover, required by Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The European Union, together with all the democratic institutions of the Member States, has an inescapable duty to guarantee public safety against a global phenomenon such as terrorism. This is a duty that often involves the difficult task of reconciling limitations on certain freedoms with guaranteeing safety. Most concerns arise from the civil aviation sector. Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report contributes to the discussion and joint consideration by the three institutions with a view to adopting new measures and moving forward on this task. I agree with the call to implement harmonised rules across the EU regulating operating conditions and common standards for the detection performance of scanners, which is why I fully support the work done by my colleague.

) Mr President, Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public law enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers’ interests. As we know, the regulation proposes to achieve its aims by establishing an EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws in the Member States. In the light of recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection, I agree on the need to update the legislation. By removing the irrelevant laws, we will ease consumer protection cooperation between the national enforcement authorities. I think the amendments set out in Mr Repo’s report will successfully translate our pre-established objectives into reality and improve legal certainty, so I therefore voted in favour.

Mr Wagner’s report clearly shows the importance of an integrated European energy network, in order to be able to guarantee security of supply and diversification of sources. I believe that in order to achieve these objectives, enshrined also in the recent Treaty of Lisbon, it is right to give priority to energy infrastructures, which the Commission also considers to be outdated and poorly interconnected. We must face this infrastructure deficit, and the measures contained in Mr Wagner’s report do precisely this. The difficulties and crises in bilateral relations between energy consumer countries and producer countries are further proof of the fact that we have to think to the future, to an energy policy for the European Union. Mr Wagner’s report is a first step in this direction, and therefore I have given him my support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the significance of this report, only 19 Member States reported on core indicators. This situation does not allow us to have a clear picture of the impact of cohesion policy on the ground. I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr Mikolášik, and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one, as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies. The organisation of public debates and consultations with stakeholders, together with the submission of reports to national parliaments for opinions are further positive measures in this sense. We have to make efforts to prevent a reduction in the funding made available for cohesion policy in the next programming period. For this reason, I supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights presented by the Commission has the merit of combining the four previous directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument. I agree with the report’s objectives. It is essential to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers in the 27 Member States and at the same time take into due account the need for manufacturers, regardless of their size, to provide their goods and services to European consumers without having to deal with unnecessary legal barriers. As things currently stand, the elimination of legal fragmentation is a difficult result to achieve. Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report also rightly expresses doubts as to whether full harmonisation could produce different effects to those expected. I therefore voted in favour, because I am convinced that it would be useful to make an amendment to the Commission’s proposal, achieving minimum harmonisation and at the same time guaranteeing a high-level service to consumers.

 My colleague Mr Casini’s report confronts and makes a positive contribution towards resolving the problems associated with interpreting and applying Rule 51 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I fully share Mr Casini’s view that it did not suffice to refer to a sole interpretation and to the guidelines intended to facilitate implementation. The conditions for the application of the procedure with joint meetings of committees and a joint vote – and I am referring in particular to the criteria of ‘competence and major importance’ of the matter in question – are clear and suited to eliminating the legal uncertainties that have existed up until now. I offer my congratulations for the good work accomplished, and I hope that this report is able to facilitate the work of Parliament by means of greater use of this procedure. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 We are currently witnessing radical changes in the international order; changes to which the European Union can no longer be a mere spectator. I think the European Union should see this as a starting point and take a truly active role in dealing with both current and emerging world powers, shaking off once and for all its reputation as a political dwarf in terms of international policy. In the same vein, I agree with the need expressed in Mr Lambsdorff’s proposal for the Member States to exert pressure during discussions to reform the United Nations Security Council in order to obtain a permanent seat for the European Union. By strengthening the role of the European Union at the United Nations, we will succeed in ensuring that the EU takes a leading role in regional and global affairs. Otherwise, we shall have to keep facing up to the continuous lack of coordination of Member States’ interests on the international scene. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Despite a series of hindrances – such as the economic crisis, the persistent inability to close the gap with the United States and increasing competition from emerging countries – the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has proved that it can offer added value to European research and development. FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Looking at Mr Audy’s report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium–sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility. With a view to negotiating the future financial perspective from 2014, these measures will pave the way for the Europeanisation of research. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The data in the report by Mrs Hirsch is alarming: the youth unemployment rate is now 21%, twice the average rate of unemployment at EU level. The motion contains useful ideas and should surely be seen in a positive light, yet I am convinced that we need to provide adequate financial resources in order to properly tackle the challenges posed by the Copenhagen Process and the EU 2020 strategy, for instance through the Structural Funds and, in particular, through the European Social Fund. With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States. Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market, I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’.

Mr President, the proposal for a regulation on which we are being called to vote undoubtedly has the merit of bringing together in a single text all the existing legislation relating to textile products. This regulation will make it possible to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework on the development and use of new fibres, as well as supporting the development of innovative products and encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector. I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list. While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation.

Mr President, making it easy for citizens to scrutinise how decisions are made, together with the processes, elements and resources that influenced them, helps both to ensure greater transparency and to close the gap between the European institutions and citizens, which is often discussed in relation to legitimacy and to the so-called democratic deficit in the European Union. Great progress has been made in the last few years. One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission’s 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a ‘one-stop shop’ register for lobbyists. The approval of the Stubb-Friedrich report by this House led to the creation of a joint working group. We can safely say that the results achieved by that group with regard to the objectives set by Parliament are more than satisfactory. I fully agree with Mr Casini’s report, as the transparency of political institutions is a fundamental condition of their legitimacy. This is why I have supported the proposal.

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon lists foreign direct investment among the matters pertaining to common commercial policy. Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has exclusive competence in this matter. Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have maintained a significant number of agreements with third countries on foreign direct investment. If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter. The adoption of measures to substitute the existing agreements is the only way to ensure a high degree of protection for investors and to ensure that their rights are recognised and guaranteed by the legal certainty of such agreements. The draft certainly moves along these lines and I have therefore voted in its favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The Internal Market is without doubt the most important instrument that the European Union has to foster growth in the wake in the recent financial crisis. The millions of citizens and businesses that reap the benefits of the Internal Market must be able to exercise their rights and be able to travel, work and live freely anywhere in Europe. This is why they must also have access to effective remedies if they intend to make a claim against another citizen or business that endangers these rights. Today, the European Union has instruments in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts. However, the actual right to have judgments enforced is still lacking. Establishing an effective system for the freezing and disclosure of debtors’ assets, and stepping up cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States, are the best ways of filling these gaps. That is why I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy’s report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

According to Article 325(5), the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council an annual report on measures taken for the implementation of this Article. I agree that we need to quantify in greater detail the recovery levels of funds unduly paid to the EU Member States by gathering specific data. Another important point, rightly highlighted by Mrs Ivan in her report, is the use of better investigative methods regarding fraud carried out by Member States. In this way, we can standardise counter measures throughout the European Union and determine whether similar types of fraud have been committed in other countries. This is why I have supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Single Market is a valuable tool for economic recovery in the European Union, particularly for the creation of new jobs.

Fifty Proposals for improving our work, enterprises and dealings together for a highly competitive social market economy’. I think we should have put more emphasis on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, and the stimulation of innovation and competitiveness by the lifting of bureaucratic, administrative and regulatory burdens. However, I agree with the general structure of the report and, in particular, with the measures mentioned which aim to strengthen e-commerce and the simplification of the procurement system.

 The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna was struck by a series of devastating earthquakes. Italy then applied for mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The EUSF was set up precisely to provide help for European citizens affected by natural disasters. I therefore voted in favour of this report to ensure that the fund would serve the purpose for which it was created. This will allow Emilia-Romagna to recover both economically and socially. The region is in real need of external assistance and I am sure that any assistance that is released will be well spent. Within a few weeks, EUR 670 million will be released in assistance to the region, and the money will be used to finance rebuilding of the electricity network and infrastructure. This is certainly an important step towards relaunching the local economy, which in turn has always played a crucial role in Italian industry.

 I voted in favour of Ms Tzavela’s report and reject the call for a moratorium. I think we should recognise the potential effects of developing the use of shale oil and gas in the European Union. Energy resources constitute a source of wealth that must be utilised and are also key for making Europe a major power in the energy field and strengthening its independence. The Member States need additional sources of energy in order to free themselves from dependence on foreign energy supply. It is therefore essential to study a variety of energy sources, including shale gas. Although this is not the only solution to our energy needs, it would bring considerable benefits. The experience of the United States could be taken as a model: there shale gas has had a notable impact, causing gas prices to fall to levels much lower than in Europe. However I believe that a cautious approach should be taken since extraction of shale gas involves possible environmental risks. We must have a clear vision of the situation, weighing up the factors for and against, and above all ensuring adequate controls. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

While the problem with Europe’s industry is definitely a problem with Europe’s industry, at the same time it is also a problem with the rules of the internal market and with policy on external relations not being sufficiently vigilant so that all kinds of goods arrive in Europe that do not comply with our rules.

 The purpose of the proposed legislation concerning the marketing and use of explosives precursors is to restrict access by members of the public to fifteen substances in high concentrations, which are dangerous because they can be used to make homemade explosives. I therefore voted in favour of Mr Mulder’s report, because I believe it could help to prevent potential terrorist attacks and consequently is a very important step to guarantee citizens’ safety. I think it is important, in the case of some categories of substance, for public access to be authorised by setting up a licence system harmonised at European level, and for other categories I think this access needs to be accompanied by reporting and traceability of suspicious transactions.

 I think that Ms Collin-Langen’s report reflects well the speed of change of the credit market. I voted in favour because I think it could have a positive effect on growth and investment. Its effectiveness is due to the fact that it simultaneously pursues two objectives: to guarantee a high level of consumer protection and to strengthen the internal market in cross-border consumer credit. The importance of approving this report lies in its ability to harmonise some key aspects of credit law, which has enabled better protection to be given to European consumers. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The consequences of the current economic and financial crisis will drag on for a long time yet, having a negative effect on the European economy, the employment rate, public savings and social investments in Europe. In addition to this, austerity measures aimed at restoring the sustainability of public finances are having a negative effect on employment and competitiveness in Europe. I support this report, which I see as a very important step forward. I think that this difficult situation requires a coordinated EU approach and I recognise the need for measures aimed at promoting employment, stimulating growth and relieving economic problems, such as encouraging proper social investments that guarantee the creation of skilled jobs and continuing vocational training.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have had a good debate today in Parliament on the issues of industry, growth and employment, which, as the Commissioner pointed out just now, began this morning with the plenary debate with Commissioners Tajani and Andor and has effectively continued, because we talked about energy for a long time, addressing the problems faced by the automotive industry. We will now continue with a question I submitted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which will be discussed here this evening. We were given assurances that in December we would have a solution to this problem, and I believe that everything we voted on yesterday at the start of the session reinforces the attention Europe is paying to this issue. There is no doubt that a host of industrial activities are linked to the European steel industry: on the one hand, upstream, the steel, iron, cast iron and iron alloy industry, and on the other, downstream, all of the industries that use these products, particularly the automotive, mechanical engineering, building, piping and metal goods sectors, as well as maritime and naval shipbuilding, domestic appliances, chemicals and other sectors. To maintain an active and competitive steel industry is vital for the future of Europe and its citizens. Even by early 2000, Europe had already lost its supremacy, beaten by China to the top spot. In recent years, the European Union has chosen to invest heavily in environmental issues – and that is a choice we approve of – but this has doubtless led to rising costs in this sector, together with an increase in commodity prices and rocketing energy costs – let us not forget that in Europe, electricity costs 100 % more than in the United States – and for some Member States, higher borrowing costs. In 2007, European steel production reached an all-time high, with 406 000 workers directly employed in the sector and in related activities. During the period 2007-2011, we saw a 10.6 % fall in employment, and today the industry employs 363 000 workers. These are rather discouraging figures, particularly for 2012. The most worrying figure is the sharp decline in production in sectors closely linked to steel; in other words, automotive and construction, which last year alone recorded a fall in production of 3.2 %. Non-European imports are steadily rising. The administrative burden that European manufacturers must bear is high and gives rise to additional costs that reduce our capacity for investment in innovation and research, at times even resulting in relocation. Perhaps we should ask ourselves if, alongside the new strategy for industrial policy that the Commission has recently adopted, there is a need for sector policies, which seek to intervene on a case-by-case basis to reverse damaging trends that Europe can no longer afford. We know that the Commission is working on an action plan for the steel industry: what stage is this at? Having welcomed the CARS 2020 Action Plan, we would also like to see an operational plan for the steel industry that can be implemented immediately. It is perhaps worth considering whether policies could be introduced that would fully enable our strategic companies to respond to global competition. To be innovative, we should imagine the re-industrialisation of Europe being accompanied by a set of policies that need our support, such as research and innovation, which is an essential tool. However, I would also like to mention the need for a review of competition policy, which was drawn up in the 1990s and perhaps does not take into account the need for Europe’s economy to deal with a global market and global competition. The completion of the internal market is essential in order to bring down the cost of energy and special attention must be given to trade agreements with third countries. To conclude, we should perhaps also ask ourselves whether it is worth reinstating a Council dedicated solely to industry, returning to the situation prior to 2002. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of us in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have submitted a question for oral answer to this Parliament, to be dealt with tomorrow afternoon. The motion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was approved unanimously, by 44 members out of the 44 who were present, and on this occasion it became clear that it would be beneficial to seek a resolution. I know that the Bureau has decided in the first instance not to accept our motion. Mr President, I would like to ask this Chamber and you if we could review this position, since we believe that Europe is currently going through extremely difficult times in many sectors, but particularly in steel and steelmaking, given that jobs in this sector fell by 10.6 % during 2011 and, indeed, there is talk of another reduction by 10.4 % this year. For this reason, I think it would be beneficial to everyone to send a signal to the Commission and to Europe if, after tomorrow’s debate, we could already think of passing a resolution in December.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been the compromise possible today to clarify the issue of energy efficiency, which, until now, has remained the Cinderella figure of the climate and energy package. I thank all those who worked to achieve this result which – I repeat – is the only compromise possible today. It is now up to the Member States to respond accordingly by taking action on public buildings and cutting red tape to raise public awareness. I am glad that the Commissioner reaffirmed the commitment to present the report by 2014, because that will allow us to assess the results already achieved and to propose any new guidelines, which are certainly necessary.

 We are facing an historic moment in which migration flows are mixed and we have to deal with asylum applications by land and by sea. I voted in favour of the report on enhanced solidarity in the field of asylum as it is a concrete commitment to guarantee suitable and effective asylum policies. The report outlines better harmonisation of protection and asylum standards and increased solidarity between Member States, which is to say, mutual assistance and responsibility sharing between Member States in order to ensure rights are promoted and respected. I agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur: practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity, and I also believe it is necessary to make use of the complementarity of EU funds.

 The new regulation on European standardisation is a satisfactory compromise reached after a year of tough negotiations. I believe that standardisation is a key step on the road to achieving the objectives outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy and to boosting the internal market. This regulation will help European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity within a constantly updated system, products will be safer, services faster and costs lower. All this is advantageous, particularly for previously under-represented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will now be better represented and which will now incur lower costs and fewer burdens in general. The regulation does include among its objectives the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and increased transparency, as well as consumer and environmental protection. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

In December 2010, Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 were adopted, calling for a review of EU rules governing pharmacovigilance, which applied in July 2012. While the new legislation did strengthen pharmacovigilance at EU level, there are some potential weaknesses in the system in the texts on this issue that still need to be addressed. I voted in favour of the report on pharmacovigilance as it ensures stronger surveillance on the use of medicines and refines the system with regard to disclosure and notification of information to stakeholders. The legal framework is thereby now strengthened, ensuring higher levels of transparency and safety. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The issue of growth, especially in this historic period where Europe is going through a period of economic and financial crisis, is amongst the priorities on Europe’s agenda. ‘Europe 2020’ includes measures aimed at achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. To achieve the objectives set out in this strategy and to help the market unleash its full potential, modern and efficient infrastructure (in the field of transport and energy) throughout Europe is of key importance. This is exactly why I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report. It focuses on project bonds which, in addition to equity instruments and grants, help to finance new projects and obtain more private investment. For 2010-2020, EUR 1.5 trillion will be needed to build infrastructure, whereas the figure allocated in the text is EUR 230 million. There is still a lot of work to be done, but in this situation, Mr Färm’s report is a step in the right direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Within the context of the process of European integration, the creation of a single railway area is of fundamental importance. One need only recall the fact that one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based is the free movement of persons throughout the territory of the EU. For this reason, I have wholeheartedly supported Ms Serracchiani’s recommendation. There are two aspects within it which I would like to emphasise. The first relates to the creation of a network of fully independent national regulators with greater powers, coordinated by the Commission, with the possibility, in the future, of establishing a single European regulator. The second concerns the change of duration of the contract between Member State and infrastructure manager from three to five years. This change will make it possible to have better medium- and long-term guarantees for investment plans. A single railway area will permit non-discriminatory access to the market and will make our railway network stronger, healthier and more competitive. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Roads are currently the main mode of transport within the European Union, for both passengers and freight. Freight transport by road accounts for more than two-thirds of the total tonnage. It is for that reason that I decided to vote for and support the report by Ms Ţicău, to amend the regulation on recording equipment in road transport. Tachographs have a concrete impact on the daily lives of drivers, and because of that it is vitally important to make them more efficient in order to improve road safety, drivers’ working conditions and to ensure fair competition among transport companies. Improving safety on Europe’s roads is a duty which the European Union cannot ignore. The establishment of statutory obligations for manufacturers of tachographs, authorities, transport operators and drivers, as contained in the report, does precisely this. These aspects, together with the introduction of the latest technologies, make the report an excellent point of departure for raising the level of safety on our roads. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The safety of EU citizens is one of the European Union’s main concerns. In addition to negative effects caused by failure to respect intellectual property rights having an impact on Europe’s economy, counterfeiting and piracy cost European businesses nearly EUR 250 billion annually, and damage and jeopardise the health and safety of the residents of the EU’s 27 states. I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann because it deals precisely and clearly with an extremely important issue, by seeking to simplify the regulatory framework that currently exists, so as to make measures to combat counterfeiting more effective and rigorous. Consumer protection, facilitation of the work of customs authorities, protection of intellectual property rights and combating fraud are the keystones on which European policy in this sector must rest. We will only be able to achieve protection of the health and defence of European citizens and the EU economy through vigorous and decisive protection of intellectual property rights, and this report is an important step towards attaining this goal.

 Road safety is a subject of enormous importance, especially nowadays, when technology and developments in the automotive sector are reaching ever higher levels. The EU’s task is to adopt legislation that will enable citizens to travel on safe roads and in safe vehicles. That is why I voted for the resolution moved by Mr Koch and Ms Sehnalová on the adoption of the eCall system in all cars by 2015. The introduction of this device will bring many benefits. In the event of a serious accident, a vehicle equipped with eCall will automatically place a 112 emergency call, even if the passenger is not in a fit state to speak, and provide the emergency services with all the key information on the accident. Thanks to the use of this technology, about 2 500 lives will be saved every year and the severity of injuries sustained will fall by 10-15%, all due to the swifter and more efficient intervention of the rescue services at the scene of the accident.

 This proposal for a regulation is intended to overhaul the provisions on foodstuffs for specific nutritional uses, contained in the Framework Directive on Dietetic Products, which makes substantial reference to the 1979 standard. The proposal intends to abolish the concept of dietetic foods and set out a new framework containing general provisions for a limited number of well-defined categories of foods judged essential for some particularly vulnerable sections of the population, for example foods aimed at infants and children and foods to be used under medical supervision. Vulnerable people need greater protection than the rest of the population and must be able to benefit from a high level of legal certainty. The proposal also suggests creating a single legal act that regulates the list of substances that can be added to the food categories that are the subject of this proposal. The differences in how Member States implement the existing legislation are currently too large, causing market distortions and administrative burdens. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The EU-Latin America partnership has always been very strong, both from a cultural and a commercial standpoint. Indeed, the Union is the principal donor of development aid and the principal investor in the area. I voted in favour of the report on development cooperation with Latin America since it clearly and accurately addresses topics important to future collaboration between the EU and Latin America. At this time of economic crisis, we must enhance current EU-Latin America relations. The food crisis, the fight against climate change and social problems are challenges common to both of these areas. A positive resolution of the above issues will largely depend on the cooperation relationship that will be established in the coming years. Multilateralism and enhanced cooperation are two paths that we must embark upon with determination. Cooperating and collaborating with Latin America, by sending targeted aid, tailored to the situation and to the specific needs of each State, does not mean simply aiming to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This cooperation will also help eradicate poverty and inequality and boost economic development of the area. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted for the report on cross-border voluntary activities, which was tabled on the eve of the closure of the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. I believe it fills the existing regulatory gap and marks a step forward in relation to the current situation. The report sets out much-needed objectives, such as removing barriers to volunteers and thus allowing them greater and easier movement, and increasing volunteers’ knowledge in areas such as cultural heritage, sport and health. Voluntary work, which accounts for 5% of Europe’s GDP, improves the quality of people’s lives, provides considerable added value and adds to the training of young people, who can then look forward to a better career. There are currently 100 million European citizens working in voluntary activities; this is a fundamental expression of active citizenship and an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth. Voluntary work does entail costs, however, even though it is not paid, and there is therefore a need for tax exemption. Mr Scurria’s report promotes high-quality volunteering within and across national borders, and puts forward important proposals, such as creating a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and introducing a European Skills Passport.

 The Internet is the primary information tool used by millions of people around the world every day. Its strategic significance means that the European Union should pay particular attention to it, and regulation and protection of the Internet from external attacks are subjects of extreme importance. All the countries of Europe, in conjunction with private businesses, need to make a coordinated effort to try to contain and neutralise any cyber attacks. I voted in favour of Mr Kalfin’s report because a large number of European citizens and businesses are at risk of cyber attacks every day. The report proposes effective solutions to the problem. One such solution would be to implement a global plan whereby the interaction of the governments, businesses and individuals involved would prevent cyber attacks from happening and render the Internet more secure and protected. Information security is key to European security. Europe cannot, and must not, forego the need to protect user data and intellectual property. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The subject of energy security is vitally important in the policies of the European Union. The EU spends over EUR 400 billion on energy imports every year, and so its dependence on third countries is self-evident. Coordinating the Member States; diversifying energy suppliers, routes and sources; extending Europe’s sphere of influence beyond its borders; sharing information on energy data and projects in third countries; and developing partnerships with suppliers and international organisations are the key points on which the new European energy policy should be based. If we put these guidelines into practice alongside everything the European Union is doing in terms of energy efficiency and developing new forms of energy, we will be in a position to achieve a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy. Much remains to be done before we have a proper common energy policy, but there is no doubt that Parliament intends to move firmly in that direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The global economic crisis remains a concern for the European institutions and EU citizens. The creation of a financial transaction tax (FTT) has some significant aspects for the EU’s budget. I voted for the report by Ms Podimata because it stresses once again the constant attention being paid by the European Union to the effects of the crisis. In addition, its implementation will make it possible to generate more fiscal revenue for the European Union’s budget: approximately EUR 57 billion (two thirds of the total revenue of the FTT). It should be emphasised that the FTT needs to be applied globally, not merely at European Union level; otherwise, there would be a risk that financial entities would migrate to markets outside the EU, thus weakening the European market.

The report by Ms Sarnez is very important and topical at this time of global economic crisis. I voted for the report by my fellow Member because it sets out effectively and precisely an overview of the most sensitive and significant issues in relations between the European Union and China. Aspects such as reciprocity, the protection of intellectual property rights, transparent rules, the resolution of the trade imbalance and the formulation of rules to create a system of competition that is fair, honest and founded on a level playing field are all issues of great importance for European industry as a whole. In view of the very important part now played by the Chinese market for our enterprises, this report is a clear signal to the European institutions, with the intention that these issues should be tackled as swiftly as possible so that European enterprises may enter the Chinese market and thus take advantage of the many investment possibilities it offers.

 This own-initiative report welcomes the work carried out in order to establish a European Union internal security strategy. By virtue of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is actually entitled to take the lead on this issue, setting priorities and defining the future internal security model. I consider the work carried out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and by Ms Borsellino, to be significant. The key areas of European intervention are highlighted here and the primary objective seems to be that of achieving greater cooperation among the Member States’ courts and police, in order to tackle the threats arising from organised crime, terrorism, corruption, cybercrime and also natural disasters. I fully agree with the intention to create a common European area of freedom, security and justice and to adopt a unified strategy for all Member States. I believe that there is a great need to step up efforts in order to improve the consistency of the information and data which is used to assess the risks borne by EU bodies and to guarantee transparency in the methods used, thereby achieving the basic purpose of ensuring full protection of citizens.

The report by Mr de Jong stresses that in order to guarantee coherent and high-quality European legislation on criminal law, the three institutions must reach an agreement on principles and working methods. I am in agreement with this own-initiative report due to the serious approach that was taken in regulating such a delicate policy area. In particular, I agree with the importance given to mutual recognition, harmonisation of protection standards and the principle of the presumption of innocence. I support the creation of a common European legal culture and of a uniform and coherent strategy as well as the promotion of greater institutional coordination, while ensuring that the main areas of criminal law remain the responsibility of the Member States. The law must be extremely clear and easy to understand, which is why I agree that the European Commission should appoint a specific coordinating authority. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I welcome the report by Ms Irigoyen Pérez, which aims to ensure equal treatment and the elimination of discrimination in the internal market and, in particular, protection of the most vulnerable consumers. This is to be achieved through a targeted strategy which consists of promoting programmes to support consumer information and education, uniform application of standards in all Member States and transparent pricing, especially with regard to e
-commerce. We also need stricter rules on advertising, which is misleading at times, and a greater control over the information given to the public in order to avoid buyers making ill-informed choices. Consumers need to be better protected when buying and they must be carefully looked after, by creating legislation on adequate, clear and precise information, which will help achieve a more transparent and competitive single market.

 Turkey is a candidate country for accession to the European Union, and is therefore bound to observe the Community acquis
 and to commit to respecting human rights, including the rights of women and gender equality, one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, these rights are not always respected in Turkey, a country where violence against women continues to occur day after day. I believe that there is a definite need for a change of course, a transformation of the patriarchal structure of Turkish society and culture. This report calls on the Turkish Government to take concerted and coordinated action to implement legislative measures on women’s rights, their education and participation in politics. Turkey does not do enough to protect women. There are still countless cases of forced or early marriages. Development of better education for all is essential when it comes to fundamental rights.

 The ITER project has a particular importance within the programme for a greener, more sustainable Europe, a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy.

The additional financing for 2012-2013 confirms Parliament’s desire to support a project that is very ambitious, much discussed, but also extremely important when it comes to striving for excellence in a sector in which the EU can take a leading role.

 Education is a fundamental aspect that must be taken into account in the process of growth, development and prosperity for the Europe of the future.

Highly skilled workers will be needed in 35% of all jobs by 2020. Actions such as widening access to higher education, the Erasmus Master’s Degree Mobility Scheme and loans for students who want to study for a Master’s degree abroad will help the national governments in this delicate process in the interest of future generations.

The above measures are crucially important in the present crisis. They will allow the implementation of important infrastructure projects of fundamental importance for Member State revenues and for maintaining jobs. In this way, the EU can guarantee its support to Member States that are in difficulty, ensure that its aid is not lost, and provide guarantees to Member States that are net contributors.

 The European Union and the United States are together in the front line of the fight against international terrorism. Close cooperation between these two political entities is a requirement for reducing any kind of threat to a minimum. The agreement reached in 2007 is an initial step towards the end goal and now the agreement signed in November 2011 introduces important new provisions, including more efficient exchanges of information and greater protection for passenger data. I voted in favour of the agreement because it will shore up the fight against various criminal activities, aid in the capture of those guilty of terrorist acts, strengthen the transatlantic partnership and ensure that passengers’ privacy and personal details are protected.

 I think we need to start simplifying and harmonising taxes across the various Member States. Having 27 different sets of rules carries a number of disadvantages: high costs and administrative burdens, social and economic distortions, risks of discrimination and, lastly, an increase in opportunities for tax evasion. That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, who see their sovereignty over tax issues being threatened, I have voted in favour of Ms Thyssen’s report on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. Indeed, I am very much convinced that all Member States need to comply with the same rules if the single market project is to be completed. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report on the taxation of energy products and electricity because I completely agree with its basic principles: aligning provisions on energy taxation with the environmental goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and reducing distortions in the internal market between EU Member States. Indeed, the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity needs to be as coherent as possible with the EU’s environmental goals. The political groups cannot reach an agreement on proportionality. I was especially supportive of Amendment 53, which aims to rid the proposal of the principle of proportionality, primarily for pragmatic reasons. We cannot allow further increases in diesel prices at a time when, for fiscal reasons due to austerity measures, the prices of energy products are under constant pressure. Furthermore, diesel is often used for work purposes and it is obvious that road haulage would suffer major negative effects as a result of regulated minimum rate increases. Lastly, the people of Europe would not be able to comprehend such a decision. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I support Mr Cabrnoch’s report on the coordination of social security systems because I believe that a revision, an update and a clarification of the social security conditions in the various EU Member States were absolutely necessary.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Parliament’s approval, from now on, the concept of ‘righteous’, which has always been applied to those who saved Jews from the ‘final solution’, will be the heritage of all of humanity. There have been objections from those who do not recognise Soviet communism as totalitarianism and who refuse to compare the lager
 to the gulag
, from those who prefer to ignore the massacre of the Armenians so as not to prejudice relations with Turkey, from those who think that comparing the shoah
 with other horrors of the 20th century by an extended and generalised use of the word ‘righteous’ makes it banal, and finally from those who have criticised the exclusion or inclusion of this or that example of genocide or massacre. The European Parliament has overcome these and other objections and, from now on, men and women who were brave enough, and sometimes lost their lives, opposing the abuse of tyrants of any ideology or political leaning will be recognised as heroes of human dignity and heroes in the building of the moral identity of the European people.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of European foreign and security policy is especially crucial at this particular historic juncture, which is marked by an extraordinary wave of protest that has taken hold in the Mediterranean and is also spreading across the Middle East. In view of this serious crisis affecting the whole of the southern Mediterranean and now spreading into the Arabian Peninsula, the European Parliament must act as a sounding board for all these protests by ordinary people. They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes. This House wants to deal directly with the High Representative and Vice-President, Baroness Ashton, particularly because of our role in controlling the budgets of civilian and military missions under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP). The first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions, primarily the Council and the Commission, driven by the post-Lisbon approach to European politics. Another very important subject is the EU’s multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being. In this regard, I have to welcome the recent resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly granting the European Union observer status within the Security Council, thus acknowledging what the Treaty of Lisbon enshrines. We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible. The report rightly highlights the great wave of civil protest in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and also in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, and points out events, contexts and expectations for each of these countries, as well as other subjects of particular interest, such as our strong transatlantic alliance and our hugely important relations with Russia. Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during a hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a Member asked the High Representative/Vice-President a loaded question. He said that, when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States’ isolationist stance, particularly in relation to the European Union, he replied ‘There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe’. The Member then asked Baroness Ashton, ‘Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now?’ Her very British answer was: ‘Yes, I do that job, although I am called High Representative/Vice-President and not foreign minister. There is also a phone number, but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position, 2 for the French, 3 for the German, and so on’. Baroness Ashton, you have heard the speeches by many of my fellow Members, and this message is also in my report. You have a number of voices in the world, but you listen to ours – Parliament’s – more because we always support a European policy, and not just that of the Member States, to which you reply in the Council, or that of the Commission, to which you reply in the appropriate places. I would like there to be a third place in which you could express your third loyalty. This place is in the middle of this Chamber, behind the podium, because you are the Council, the Commission and also Parliament. I believe this dialogue needs to be developed and strengthened in order to achieve democratic legitimacy for our external policy, directed and controlled by Europe’s citizens. We will help you carry out this role. Gabriele Albertini,

Mr President, I made a mistake when reading the text. We deleted the name ‘Macedonia’ in order to avoid trampling on some people’s sensibilities, including those, I believe, of the President.

Mr President, please excuse me. I may be wrong, but I do not remember voting on the oral amendment to paragraph 68.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years after the start of negotiations between the European Commission and Pakistan, an agreement has finally been reached on a readmission procedure for persons residing in the European Union without authorisation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs asked permission to draft an opinion on this very important agreement, particularly bearing in mind developments in the region around Pakistan and the issue of human rights. We had a lengthy debate in committee and several concerns were raised: the unstable situation and continual violations of human rights in Pakistan, as well as the fact that negotiations held with Pakistan did not guarantee the rights and safety of persons sent back to Pakistan. Also, we were worried that no evaluation of the 11 readmission agreements already in force has yet been made. In the end, the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs concluded that a clear framework for cooperation on readmission with Pakistan was preferable to a situation where there is a risk that Member States proceed to expel illegal immigrants from Pakistan on an ad hoc basis and without supervision based on the respect for human rights. Article 16 will ensure that the EU can carry out this supervision, so I reiterate the request of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for an evaluation of the agreements concluded thus far and I support its adoption. Gabriele Albertini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: ‘No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The prohibition applies in all situations and is an overriding rule of international law and, as such, applies to all states. Not only does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights impose this protection of human rights against torture but so do the United Nations Convention and the European Convention. The European Union and its Member States take these obligations very seriously. Considering also that we celebrated the International Day against Torture last week, we believe that combating torture constitutes an absolute priority for the European Union. To respect these extremely important legal and moral obligations, we therefore need to impose a close control on the trade in equipment designed to inflict torture or other inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. The moment when the regulation was adopted represented a great step forward, as was also confirmed by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on torture. This regulation also serves as a model in terms of international legislation on the subject. The application of this regulation has not, unfortunately, been as exemplary as its adoption: only seven Member States have submitted one or more of the annual public reports laid down in Article 13 of the regulation, containing detailed information on authorisations granted for the import and export of goods that could be used for torture. These reports constitute an essential element for assessing full compliance with the regulation. Numerous questions are raised over the final use and destination of the goods when we analyse the authorisations granted. Authorities with responsibility for authorising exports must therefore carry out a more detailed political assessment before proceeding. Neither have many Member States communicated information relating to penalties applicable for infringing the provisions of the Council Regulation, as required in Article 17 of the regulation. Nearly five years after the adoption of the regulation, the list of goods identified in the Annexes to the regulation must be updated. Man can be very cruel and sometimes it seems that the human imagination for ways of inflicting suffering on others is unlimited. It is therefore of fundamental importance to keep pace with technological developments in this cheerless arena. For all these reasons, the time has come to table the question to the European Parliament and to call on the European Union and its Member States to show that they are able to keep their promises. As members of the European Parliament, it is our duty, by democratic mandate, to ensure that the institutions work responsibly. This is the reason why we want detailed information on what has been done so far to comply fully with the regulation and also on measures that will enable the situation to be improved in the future. We welcome, as a first step, the decision of the Committee supervising the application of this regulation at the end of this month. Lest we forget, Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 is not merely fine words but a fundamental and essential instrument that must now be applied in full. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union needs to adopt a new approach and make a joint effort when facing global challenges. The powers recently obtained due to the entry into force of the treaty mean that Parliament engages in frequent, cooperative and effective discussions with our primary interlocutor, Baroness Ashton, who has the honour of acting as the new Vice-President/High Representative for the first time. Her mandate was subject to our consensus vote in January and, on several occasions, the Parliamentary Assembly was promised that the Council and the Commission would be constantly involved in all the most important aspects of European security and defence. As the report itself confirms, the High Representative is therefore called upon to appear before the European Parliament and to consult it frequently and regularly. With the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union’s external action takes on a new and important dimension, but actually achieving this goal also depends on the European Union having the necessary budgetary resources. The European Parliament has a key role to play in its capacity as custodian of the democratic legitimacy of external action. The creation of a European External Action Service will give a diplomatic body and system to the European Union which, until now, has only been able to rely on national representation. The roles of the official representatives, whose appointment is the responsibility of the High Representative, assume great relevance and topicality. Nonetheless, as stated in the report, Parliament is calling for greater powers of ballot and control over the roles and the mandates of individual representatives, upholding the principles of transparency and merit that must guide the High Representative when appointing candidates. It is hoped that we will eventually achieve a situation of double hatting – except in the case of the special representative, whose range of action should be regional – and that we will therefore benefit from economies of scale, making the European Union’s external action more efficient and, at the same time, less costly. After an initial introductory section on strategy, the report addresses the issue of European foreign policy by theme and geographical area. The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied, especially the United Nations, the chief custodian of global security. It must play an important role, not only from the viewpoint of its seat on the Security Council, but also in terms of staff and delegations connecting the two bodies. We call on the Vice-President/High Representative to let Europe fulfil its ambition to become an active, strategic and independent partner of a great ally such as the United States in order to respond to the global challenges of terrorism, finance, and the often fraught relationships with industrial giants such as Russia, China and Japan. The report continues with a geographical analysis of what we can hope to achieve. In the Balkans, the theme of enlargement is introduced: the report praises the gradual achievement of the stabilisation process in Kosovo, where the European Union is present with the EULEX mission, but efforts must still be made to ensure that accession standards are respected for many countries close to candidacy for accession – Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the chapter concerning cooperation with the East and the Black Sea regions, the report deals with the issue of the European Union’s energy supply security and dependency. In the section on Russia, it calls for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to be signed. As far as the South Caucasus is concerned, the report calls for the territory of Georgia and its ethnic minorities to be left intact, and for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria to be resolved Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the European Union must play a stronger political role in relaunching the peace process following the Council decision of 12 December 2009. Union for the Mediterranean: resolution of the Turkey-Cyprus conflict. Asia: Afghanistan, critical period for the establishment of a new government after the elections; Pakistan’s key role in the fight against terrorism; concern over the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. Africa: positive contribution of the Somali coast defence mission. Latin America: need to create a stable and enduring partnership for relationships between the European Union and Latin America. I will listen to my fellow Members’ comments with great interest and respond to them at the end. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

I thank my fellow Members, so many of whom have spoken, especially those who approved the key parts of the report, praising and endorsing its content, but also those who expressed criticisms and who, above all, did so in a desire to overcome the regrettably tragic instances where force has been used, and to dream of a peaceful world. A great Greek philosopher, Plato, said that only the dead will see an end to war. However, despite our refusal to bow to this philosophy and our attempts to prevent this happening, reality compels us to use force even on peace missions. I congratulate High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, and thank her for having mentioned my report: one aspect of her approach that I particularly like is its dual nature, the way it seeks synergy between the tasks of the Council and the Commission. Her very physical location – which will alternate between the benches of the Council, here, and the Commission – exemplifies her wish to wear two hats. As Parliament, I believe that we must support and promote this synergistic commitment. The European Commission pursues policies for development, neighbourhood, and for stability and the promotion of human rights and democracy; the Council undertakes peace missions and missions to implement the rule of law. This set of themes must find its ultimate expression in the European foreign diplomatic service, which must be efficient, effective, and equipped with the necessary skills and resources to be able to carry out its role as it should, and we will work hard to achieve this. I also thank the High Representative – and we will discuss this further on 23 April – for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of the external service, which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth. Today marks the beginning of our collaboration, but certainly not the end. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public opinion is divided on the Goldstone report. In particular, the Israeli armed forces are accused of having deliberately caused the deaths of countless civilians during the urban guerrilla operations. This is a very serious accusation, which appears to overlook certain undeniable facts, such as the distribution of leaflets throughout the battle zone to explain that houses containing weapons and munitions could be hit, and the telephone and radio warnings, including on Hamas frequencies, before attacks were launched on buildings identified as arms depots. The so-called ‘roof knocking’ technique was also used: if, after all those warnings, the air force still identified buildings full of people, small explosive and, above all, loud, charges would be launched to quickly evacuate the buildings. The Israeli army introduced warning signals for the Gaza civilians that no one else had put into practice before. Anyone who uses all these precautions cannot, under any circumstances, be accused of deliberately targeting civilians. Yesterday, on the same day, I met two major political figures: the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, in the morning, and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, in the evening. In both cases, the meeting was held in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and the hope expressed that, after too many decades of fighting, weapons will finally be abandoned in favour of a peace process. Just as both governments have also requested, Europe must maintain its balanced role as an impartial judge, sheltered from ideological positions that could only further inflame the feelings of both sides. Gabriele Albertini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Monday’s vote within the Committee on Foreign Affairs provided additional evidence of the complexity and, at the same time, of the benefit of extending the geographical and political borders of the Europe that we know today. Thanks to the work and efforts of my fellow rapporteurs and the contribution of individual political groups, we have achieved a text that expands on the original and has refined many aspects that were initially only mentioned in passing. The debate in committee and also within the groups themselves was not lacking in disagreements, sometimes lively, which are typical of an across-the-board confrontation that transcends the respective political positions. Historical events within each nation and the current state of their relations were at odds with applications made by candidate countries or aspiring candidates. In less than a year, another three applications were submitted to open membership negotiations: Montenegro in December 2008, Albania in April 2009 and Iceland in July 2009. It is a sign that the European project can still boast plenty of appeal and is considered a major factor of stability, particularly following the meltdown in financial markets. The text obtained as a result of the votes within the Committee on Foreign Affairs more forcefully underlines the need for the countries who wish to join the European Union to face up to this transition conscientiously, aware of the duties and implications that this process involves. Their entry requires them to respect European parameters, not only economic and political, but also cultural, social and legal, to ensure that the end result is more than the sum of its parts. I hope that the text that the plenary session will vote on tomorrow will address all aspects of the general strategy on enlargement in a more balanced and concise way. It will obviously benefit from the contribution of specific resolutions on each country. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE
),

The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us. I am grateful to Mr Brok and to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the excellent work they have done in spite of the little time available. On the basis of this work, the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service. The message that we want to send out to the Commission and the Council is basically this: we want a service that has extensive powers and which fulfils our ambitions of making the European Union a global political player, and we want this to happen on a consensual basis, that is to say, with the involvement and the support of all three institutions – Parliament, the Commission and the Council. I therefore urge the Commission to be courageous in the negotiations and to defend the Community model, and I invite the Council once again to involve this Parliament and, in particular, the committee that I chair, in the negotiations from the outset, in order to complete this crucial stage in the creation of a true European foreign policy. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Piebalgs. His statements just now confirm that South Stream is not Nabucco’s competitor but a further contribution to the diversification of Europe’s energy supply sources. Europe’s energy security is based on a variety of sources, routes and supply countries. At zero growth, future demand for gas is estimated at an additional 100 to 150 billion m3 
by 2020. Based on these assumptions the development of different options is imperative, and South Stream is not an alternative to Nabucco, but in fact complements it. The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco, South Stream and the Turkey-Greece-Italy interconnection (ITG). The anti-Russia debate is therefore in conflict with what we will see happening over the next few years. The European Parliament must call for pragmatism and above all consistency in the decisions that the European Union has essentially already taken: with the European economic recovery plan, with Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks, and with the second energy security strategy. The diversification of sources, routes and supply countries is the real pillar of Europe’s energy security policy and, leaving aside the political and economic interests of the various countries most directly involved, the South Stream-Nabucco challenge must be analysed with realism, not through the distorting prism of ideology but rather with a clear vision of what needs to be done. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, have to say that I had got a somewhat different impression of the conclusions of the summit from reading the newspapers from my own and other countries yesterday and the day before. This morning you, Mr Van Rompuy – and you more than Mr Barroso, in fact – have dashed those hopes and have cast doubt on a solution that had been touted in the papers and all the statements as a turning point, a new approach and a chance for Europe to rebuild and restore real confidence. I agree with Mr Barroso that it is a very important basic principle to make it clear in the various statements and in the final document that monetary stability in a modern economy can only lead to financial stability. Someone called it an historic statement; I see it as a basic premise to start from. If the state bailout fund gives the virtuous countries that have access to the fund the chance to recapitalise, then there is a real prospect, a real possibility. The term ‘possible’ dominates the final document; of course I join those who are laying a huge responsibility on your shoulders right now. In your reply, you must explain effectively and decisively whether the Member States can really put plans into action and be confident that it is not merely a general, abstract reversal of a trend that is not going well and is not enough for the markets. Everyone is said to be making do because we need to reach the end of the tunnel. I believe we are a very long way from the end of the tunnel and so, as regards putting plans into action, we had imagined that all the uncertainty of the previous year in Europe might be swept away by a real, effective decision to be reached at the Brussels Summit. Should we feel disappointed on this point? Should we wonder why it has not come true? Please tell us, Mr Van Rompuy, so we can avoid all these misunderstandings. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Swoboda for his solidarity with regard to the recent tragedies in Italy and especially for the significance he attached to the problems we are dealing with: civil harmony and the possibility that, through solidarity and the possibility of development, we can build a different Europe and a different civil society. It is clear to all of us that the debate conducted by Parliament in recent months on the intergovernmental agreement known as the fiscal compact has vindicated all political groups: I believe that the concerns we expressed have all come true. I am also sorry that the minister denies that there is a gap between austerity and development because I think that this dichotomy has hitherto paralysed our debate, as well as Europe’s development. The one-way monetary policy is not a development policy, just as a balanced budget is a bureaucratic, systematic element, but not forward-looking. The clash between austerity and development is not suited to the complexity and the needs of Europe – something we are all becoming aware of – because we are finding it difficult to move forward, which is perhaps the result of this deficiency and cultural poverty which always leads to an economic freeze. At the forthcoming summit, we must therefore develop a different policy, creating a political Europe as well as a fiscal Europe. While the Commissioner has stated he is ready for action, Parliament can only take him at his word. This is an important statement because to date, we have had to create the conditions, at least I interpret it that way, positively, even though others have taken different positions. However, we need finally to agree on a plan, a strategy able to create a political Europe, which is vital for a Europe of development. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at a time of crisis in Europe – because the debate in this House by all the groups regarding the agreement of 1 March has shown that the Community is in crisis – it is very significant that a country such as Serbia should be given the status of candidate for EU membership. I believe that it is a key moment, and I agree with the representatives of the Commission and of the Council, and with the rapporteur, that Serbia has taken many steps forward but must continue to solve problems and find uniformity with Europe. I believe this is a time of stability and a time of security for Europe and that the new relationship that Serbia is beginning to establish with Kosovo gives great hope not only to Italy, because its borders are closer, more adjacent, but also to all of Europe, which I believe has an interest in peace as a whole being guaranteed. I believe that we need to monitor behaviour, but I think all of us should be pleased about this rapprochement

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that today we have heard three speeches that bode well for Europe. They represent three programmes and three strategies. I would like to say to Ms Thorning-Schmidt that she has made a very important point, that Denmark follows Europe’s destiny. It is not just a throw-away line, it is a phrase that makes a commitment to strengthen Europe and to offer total support; to make sure, as she said at the end, that the Community method prevails. We therefore find ourselves in a very difficult situation – and mine is not empty rhetoric – as we are facing a halt in the EU development process. This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States. We have come to a standstill and are facing very difficult times, which I do not believe will lead to the possibility of development. With the intergovernmental agreement there is neither growth nor development. Therefore the commitment of the Danish Presidency is to prevent all this from happening. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel I need to express how I feel, which is both dismayed and concerned. I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose. We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other. There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament. Therefore I believe that we must do justice to this and take into account the fact that, as has been said, the Commission must guarantee the Treaties. The Commission therefore …  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I followed this morning’s debate and I have to say to the Polish President that what emerged showed far greater consensus than dissent. I personally belong to the group of people who expressed consensus and I would like to underline a very important part of the Polish President’s speech which yesterday provoked very lively discussion: You said, with regret, that the intergovernmental approach tends to take precedence over the European Community approach. The European Community has not seen the kind of development that we imagined for some years now, and the intergovernmental approach – as President Barroso clearly explained yesterday – paralyses the momentum which EU law would otherwise have achieved over the past few years. The prevalence of EU law is at odds with an intergovernmental approach which fails to give rise to that hope, that potential in Europe, which you, as President for the past six months, have helped to create. Taking everything into account, we do not think the summit had either negative or positive conclusions, but left us with questions which will find answers in March. I think your Presidency has somehow prevented the fall of Europe, and we hope things will continue to develop in that vein in the year ahead. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by Mr Casini, but in the committee meeting, I tabled various amendments in the – very modest, but I believe very correct – belief that they improved the text. Those amendments were not accepted because there was a discussion, which was also held at a high level, with you in attendance, and hence an agreement had already essentially been reached. I am tabling two oral amendments, one of which I consider to be very important because, as the Article states … I would like all the Members to listen to me for a moment, because I believe there is a problem … Two minutes … Do I have to speak later? May I continue?  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer both to this amendment and to the next one, because I have tabled two oral amendments. I believe that this one is very timely and integral to the overall text, because the Article spells out the duties of MEPs in the text, in the introduction, but it is very muddled and actually stipulates what cannot be done, not what MEPs must do in accordance with what Mr Casini said about our transparency and our representation of the people, whom we must represent in a correct and very scrupulous manner. I believe that it is very muddled. I would place even more emphasis on the other amendment, Mr President. Since we are stipulating that MEPs must not accept gifts worth more than EUR 150, my amendment, ladies and gentlemen, was far stricter in proposing a much lower amount, because I believe that MEPs should not accept any gifts or courtesies save for those of little, or negligible, value. I believe that the proof of this is in a letter received by all the MEPs. This letter provides for, offers MEPs EUR 100 to take part in a survey. I believe that this is an offence against …

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like us to recall what the European Union budget really is. The budget is not additional to national budgets, and to believe so would be to continue to conduct this debate on false premises, with the risk of fragmenting our efforts. The EU budget is synthetic and has the aim of multiplying the effects of the investments made by the individual Member States. It therefore creates more efficiency and effectiveness. Resources that are removed from the EU budget raise national public expenditure: this is the underlying principle on which he have built the Union. If the EU is seen as an additional entity to the Member States, just as the EU embassy in non-EU countries is additional to all of the national embassies, then we are misleading ourselves. Therefore to believe that by saving in the EU budget, we are contributing to general saving and austerity is an unpardonable error. Instead, what we manage to achieve with the EU budget is to allow individual states to make savings, to lower expenditure and encourage austerity. If we cannot acknowledge this fact – due to the sort of ‘soft’ nationalism every state has to show to its own public opinion – the result will be that we are constantly reducing the EU budget, which will always result in increases in the national budgets. In the end the individual Member States will spend the EUR 140 billion in any case, but with diminished efficiency, because the studies carried out by the Commission already show us that each euro yields 95 cents in the EU budget but only 50 cents in the national budgets.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I believe that things are a bit better, the impression after this Council is that a sort of ‘Penelope’s shroud’ principle is being applied and we are being asked to return again to matters that we thought had been concluded. I would therefore ask in regard to the single supervisory mechanism, which is certainly a good compromise, what the Commission intends to do to put pressure on the Member States pushing for its entry into force to be postponed. What is going to be done to ensure that they adopt more reasonable positions? As many wise leaders have observed, time is money. We must acknowledge that some countries want more time, but not enough attention is being paid to the fact that we seem to be postponing indefinitely the adoption, and the final implementation, of any decision. In other words, I believe that the results achieved by the Council should be viewed positively, but I also believe that all possible efforts should be made to ensure that these results take immediate effect.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a minute is hardly enough to make a comment, but it may be enough to give a mark, and today I would like to give the President of the Commission top marks for the realism and vision he has shown.

I say vision because the path to a federal route, albeit one of nation states, is not the end of federalism but the beginning.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good opportunity to have an objective discussion on Kazakhstan and the important agreement the country is negotiating with the EU. Kazakhstan is crucial for the stability and strategic future of Central Asia and is without doubt an important economic and trading partner for the EU. The country has already launched a process of economic and democratic reform, although much remains to be achieved in these areas. However, the country has shown itself to be committed to further and more far-reaching reforms and I think that the duty of the EU is to support this process. To this end, I am certain that the signing of this enhanced agreement will allow progress to be made, because it will strengthen an already solid and productive relationship and ensure constant assistance from the EU. I am also convinced – and I think that this should have been underlined more clearly in the report to be voted tomorrow – that greater progress in the areas of democracy and human rights should be met by renewed reciprocal efforts that are both open and constructive. Our aim should not be to place ourselves on a negative footing with this or that country if change is not achieved immediately, but rather to support the efforts by these countries to attain the objective of respect for the principle of human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation for the adoption of this report that, once again, draws the attention of the European Union to the protection of health and to the protection of citizens. With this report, we have, in fact, re-addressed the issue of surveillance of medicinal products, following the adoption of Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 amending the directives on pharmacovigilance. Since the so-called Mediator case, indeed, there has been a need to address the shortcomings identified by the tests conducted in this regard, and to refine the existing system, especially with regard to information requirements and notification of stakeholders and to the list of medicinal products subject to strengthened pharmacovigilance. The amendments introduced, although modest in their scope, complement and reinforce the legal framework outlined previously in favour of greater transparency and efficiency and improved product safety standards, thus benefiting the health of European citizens.

We voted for this report, which casts light on the challenges to be faced and the gaps to be filled, particularly in relation to the target of sustainability in terms of ecological, chemical and quantitative ‘good status’, which the framework directive says must be achieved by 2015. Among the measures suggested are the mainstreaming of water issues in all EU policy areas; the development of a holistic approach that examines all water uses and their implications; promotion and support for efficiency and sustainability in the management of this basic asset; and the achievement of water supply security, not only regionally but also internationally.

 The proposal for a regulation in question, updating Directive 2009/39/EC in line with legal and market developments, has raised questions over the classification of many products as ‘dietetic’, establishing general provisions for only a limited number of food categories considered essential for certain vulnerable population groups – foods aimed at infants, children and patients under medical supervision. At the same time it has shifted protection for other groups (coeliacs and people who are lactose-intolerant) to other EU legislation and mechanisms. The positive vote on Ms Ries’s report – the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – is a clear sign and a positive starting point for the coming negotiations. On one hand, it expresses the shared wish to simplify the regulations; on the other it draws attention to the need to reintroduce in the future regulation complete protection for the specific nutritional needs of all the most vulnerable groups of consumers.

 The violent flooding which hit Liguria and Tuscany in October 2011 severely damaged infrastructure, transport networks, businesses, agriculture and residential homes. Faced with this disaster, Italy requested mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, established in 2002 precisely to provide assistance to disaster-stricken regions. Our vote in favour of Mr Fernandes’s report will enable the fund to be mobilised – for the first time this year – for a total amount of EUR 18 061 682 for the Italian regions concerned. The importance of all this will be two-fold: as practical assistance with physical reconstruction, and as a symbolic gesture that will remind all Europeans of the value of solidarity, one of the cornerstones on which the European Union is founded.

 Mr President, Ms Irigoyen Pérez’s report, which we have voted to support, concerns the need to consider developing a strategy to protect the rights of the most vulnerable consumers, in light of the strategy that the European Commission and the Member States will be required to devise to that end. Consumers may be vulnerable for various reasons, and potentially anyone may be affected. That is why this group of consumers, along with consumers in general, needs to be protected. A targeted strategy is required that considers the problem in the round while, on the one hand, avoiding creating new forms of discrimination and, on the other, eschewing static, rigid definitions that are unable to embrace all the facets of the matter and the various possible kinds of vulnerability. Specific, targeted protective measures are therefore needed. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Søvndal for his thorough description. First of all, I, too, would like to express our total support to the families of the victims of the serious clashes that took place on 16 December in Zhanaozen, and our concern for the subsequent unfolding of events. What was initially essentially a labour dispute degenerated into extremely serious incidents in which 17 people lost their lives and, in the days following the incident, led to the arrest of journalists and representatives of the opposition. It is in everyone’s interest, as Kazakhstan has done, to shed full light on the events and I therefore hope that today will be remembered solely as an opportunity for our Parliament to explore what has happened thus far, and to reiterate our call for an investigation that will reassure the international community that the responsibilities for the events of Zhanaozen will be clarified and those responsible pursued in the utmost respect of the principles of the law and respect for human rights. The delegation that I have the honour of heading has had the opportunity of hearing the explanations provided by the Kazakh authorities at some of its meetings, as well as those of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are very active in monitoring events in the country. The willingness of the authorities of Kazakhstan to provide explanations and the promise to provide further clarifications are undoubtedly positive elements and should be appreciated by us all. This is another reason why I would like to underline the need to maintain a certain balance, which I would have liked to have seen play a bigger part also in the text of the resolution on which we will have to vote tomorrow, and which, in my opinion, it would perhaps have been better to have postponed until the official investigations were over. It would also have been useful to send an official mission of international bodies to flank the investigations. The undeniable need to further clarify what happened and to call for greater efforts on the part of Kazakhstan in improving its progress along the road to democracy must also be accompanied at all times by a new commitment to an open and constructive dialogue with the country.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at such a difficult time for Europe and after the blocking of the proposal at the Council and the tabling of a new amended Commission proposal, the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union is undoubtedly a positive act. It is a useful compromise that has resolved many of the issues that caused the impasse
, such as the full financing of the scheme by the European Union, with the participation of the Union in the distribution point programme, an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million for the Union’s financial contribution, the notion of the Union origin of the foods that are then distributed and the requirement for the purchase of food products to be made on the basis of competitive procedures. The scheme will therefore be operational from 2013 and will allow the supply of food products from reserves deriving from intervention in order to benefit the most deprived persons in the Union, thus also achieving one of the most important objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Today’s vote in favour is the culmination of this report’s complex and difficult path, and is an important sign of the Union’s support for its most deprived citizens. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the increase in intellectual property infringements observed in recent years threatens to undermine the strategy on intellectual property rights in the single market that was launched by the Commission in May 2011. To combat such infringements and ensure the success of the intellectual property protection policy, it has been proposed that the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market be entrusted with certain tasks relating to the running of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, set up in 2009. The purpose of this is to provide the Observatory with the human and financial resources to combat intellectual property infringements and to conduct campaigns to raise public awareness of the risks of buying counterfeit products. Our adoption of the report therefore marks a very important moment in the fight against the trade in counterfeit goods and in defence of innovation, growth and the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the jobs and security of the people of Europe.

 Four years after it was first introduced, the European Parliament is examining the status of implementation of the EU strategy for Central Asia. In the light of major developments in Europe and the world, the EU has summed up its achievements in its relations with this part of the world. This report underlines the need for a new approach focusing on strengthening long-term cooperation and a mutual strategic commitment in order to deepen the political, social and economic relations. The text also highlights the need to maintain a high level of commitment in all areas of society, thanks also to more financial resources, funding and programmes. Furthermore, the report draws attention to the institutional value of the partnership and cooperation agreements (PCAs) as the basis for exchanges with these countries and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committees as tools that can guarantee a regular platform for strengthening bilateral relations with countries in Central Asia. To sum up, the new strategy has a fundamental role in the creation of increasingly stable cooperation with this sensitive region, with which dialogue and the mutual exchange of knowledge will guarantee ambitious results in terms of economic cooperation, the promotion of development and defence of human, social and cultural rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenges posed by the modern age and by Mr Triantaphyllides’s report, for which we have voted in favour, dictate that citizens in their capacity as consumers should be placed at the centre of the EU debate, and they remind us that the safeguarding of citizens’ interests cannot remain a principle sanctified at the level of treaties, but should be a concrete and inspiring principle of EU politics. Protected and informed consumers, who are made more aware and are therefore in a position to take full advantage of the instruments and resources at their disposal, as well as to make full use of their rights, should be the final aim of the EU’s new strategy on consumer policy. This strategy should therefore be established as an approach with ample breathing space, and it should be all-encompassing, so that it can move freely from the sector of financial services to that of food, from the safeguarding of minors to advertising, and, therefore, be in a position to make an important contribution to Europe’s social and environmental objectives.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme, for which we voted in favour, is based on a measured, realistic approach which, on the one hand, has refrained from laying down impractical requirements that are impossible to meet, and on the other, has provided for a so-called flexibility scheme. By laying down stages and corresponding quantitative limits of permitted emissions, this scheme provides for the placing on the market of a pre-established annual quota of tractors meeting certain characteristics, and thereby enables the manufacturing and industrial sectors concerned to adapt to the pre-established standards gradually, without causing them disruption. Mr Tatarella has produced an important piece of work and has managed to strike a careful balance between the requirements arising from the major challenges which the EU needs to tackle at this time, and the requirements relating to environmental protection and the present economic crisis. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, in recent years, the current global economic crisis, which is even worse than the Great Depression, has caused unsustainable imbalances in international economies. The commercial disparities between countries, financial markets lacking common rules, and the instability of the banking system all constitute a potential threat to financial and economic stability. This resolution, which I support, stresses the urgent need for total reform, with new rules and global economic coordination. The economy needs a system of global governance, open markets, high economic and social standards, a more responsible monetary policy and more stringent supervisory policies; decision-making bodies and international economic bodies must be the main stakeholders driving this new approach. In particular, Europe needs a clear and transparent framework to reduce the instability that has been aggravated by, among other things, globalisation, and to guarantee wide-ranging reforms aimed at fostering growth and reducing the debt of individual Member States. This is the demand that the current resolution highlights to all the countries. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent years, we have seen an increase in the number and intensity of natural disasters, which have become increasingly global in scale, with disastrous consequences. A genuinely European response to such disasters that involves, and is binding on, all the various levels of government in which the European Union is structured is crucial to address this scenario. Ms Gardini’s valuable report, which I voted for, highlights the importance of a simplified and rationalised Civil Protection Mechanism that is more extensively and effectively coordinated at a political and operational level and is not encumbered by red tape. It must allow for the pooling of resources and skills and the optimisation of existing assets without increasing the financial burden in times of austerity. Greater attention to cross-border and geographically vulnerable areas and implementation of a culture of prevention will complement this new approach to ensure a rapid, speedy and effective response to any future needs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Fidanza on the report he has drafted, which fits logically into the framework of actions undertaken and promoted at Union level relating to tourism, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Union new powers in this field. I must stress the fact that I endorse the statement about the importance of Europe as a single destination for certified, quality tourism, as well as the intention to promote this idea by turning it into actions in terms of structures, allocation of resources, funding, and coordination of actions among the various levels of government in the countries of the Union. This is an approach to be valued and rewarded, given that the sector in question – with its implications in terms of the percentage of GDP produced, employment and new opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, and emphasis on environmental protection and enhancement – is in a position to develop and thus to respond to the major challenges of today. For all these reasons, I believe this report is positive, as it sends out an important signal for the promotion of a European tourism policy. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disaster that struck the Gulf of Mexico more than a year ago has prompted the European Commission to reflect on legislation relating to offshore oil activities. The European Parliament, too, wished to express its position on the matter, with this report. It has adopted a text that calls for the sector’s operators to have adequate technical and financial capacity and which aims to establish high safety standards so as to confirm the European Parliament’s leading role in promoting the safety of offshore activities. The new measures requested of the Commission in this regard will have to focus on international coordination and on a realistic approach that combines all of the quality procedures that exist in the sector and prevents the creation of new bodies or additional red tape, which could well delay the achievement of specific final objectives. In concrete terms, the report demands an improvement in communication and information and knowledge sharing mechanisms, in addition to greater accountability on the part of companies operating in the sector, and calls for the role and powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency to be strengthened and expanded. For all these reasons, I believe that the result achieved thanks to the negotiations on this text, for which we voted, is a positive one. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 As shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and as I have therefore followed this subject particularly closely, I feel I must congratulate Mrs Jordan Cizelj on the invaluable work she has done. Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations, due not least to the highly sensitive international context, the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent, harmonised legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely, no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future. I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies. The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards; greater attention to technical and scientific advances, particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility; increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people’s health; and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with transparency and with the role of licence holders.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation for relations with Central Asia and Mongolia, which I am honoured to chair, went to Mongolia just three weeks ago on the occasion of the eighth interparliamentary meeting of the European Parliament and Mongolia. It was a very useful and interesting experience. Mongolia is a country that deserves to be better known and there are not many opportunities in this Parliament to give it the attention that it should certainly receive. It is a country characterised by a multi-party parliamentary system, separation of powers, comparatively free public opinion and a level of human rights protection that stands out compared with the situation in many other countries in the region. It is also a country with development problems that is grappling with a difficult environmental situation and ongoing desertification. It has also been hit by extreme weather conditions recently. At the same time, it is very rich in natural resources – copper, gold, uranium and rare earths – which could attract a considerable influx of capital in the not-too-distant future. For all the above reasons, I think it is important to send out a signal of support for Mongolia at this crucial stage in its development, and to foster the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law as well as parliamentary control, so that the financial resources that become available to Mongolia can be used in future for the benefit of the people. We have to encourage Mongolia in its desire to develop closer relations with the European Union and urge it to adopt our standards and industrial regulations. We should help it move towards a market economy and more intense economic and trade relations, which are made possible by a climate of legal certainty and the development of the rule of law. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that the European Union and Mongolia are concluding will play a decisive role in this context. For all these reasons, 45 other Members and I have tabled this oral question. In this question, we ask the Commission to provide further details on the main characteristics of the agreement and the foreseeable schedule for its ratification. I would like to point out that the agreement has already been initialled, but there is currently deadlock over its signature, apparently because of doubts raised by a Member State on the legal basis used for some of the clauses. Additionally, we would like to ask the Commission about the possibility of opening a European Union delegation in Ulaanbaatar in the near future. Such an initiative could, in fact, significantly contribute to a further deepening of our political and economic cooperation with that country. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, the report on the labelling of textile products which we endorsed today marks an important step towards simplifying legislation for the benefit of consumers and all the European manufacturers working in the industry. With this regulation, we are laying down new rules on labelling in the textile industry; we are focusing increasingly on innovation in the sector and on speeding up the integration of European legislation, in order to benefit from innovative products safely. The text proposes, in fact, to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation, simplifying the existing regulatory framework and improving the transparency of procedures. Therefore, we cannot help but applaud the positive result achieved today in safeguarding European production. At the same time, however, we cannot fail to mention the indication of the country of origin issue. We hope that a further step forward can be taken soon with the approval of legislation regulating indications of origin in this sector as well. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of providing adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power plants has already been tackled by European Union legislation on the safety of the nuclear sector. Today, in the light of recent international events and the consequent decisions of the governments of the Member States in this regard, the issue is highly topical. We have expressed our backing for Mr Marinescu’s work, which deals with the specific cases of a number of countries which, upon accession, took on particular obligations on decommissioning nuclear power plants and received special support from the European Union for this very activity. Specific cases aside, on this issue we are duty-bound to establish an effective monitoring system to check and test the nuclear plants within EU territory. Indeed, the number of reactors that are thought to need to be decommissioned in EU territory in the near future is rather high. It will therefore be essential – including and above all in such cases –, to ensure the provision of guarantee mechanisms for setting aside adequate financial resources required to tackle both ordinary and extraordinary requirements.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the report by Mrs Rivasi is the result of an assessment of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 which aims to set general standards of conduct that would apply in any future global health emergency. Following a long and successful revision phase, the report makes cooperation, independence and transparency its core principles. It calls for greater and improved cooperation between the health authorities of the Member States and European institutions, in order to address harmonised and commensurate risk management. Its objectives are a change in the strategy of Member States regarding their national plans for the management of influenza, including stocks of vaccine, the publication of the names of all the experts consulted by the European health authorities, and an efficient relationship of trust with the media responsible for disseminating public health messages. That is why we voted in favour of it. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the problem of falsified medicinal products is one that is having an ever greater impact at international and EU level, in terms of the increased number of cases as well as the advances in the development of these products. These are the challenges to which Mrs Matias’s report – the outcome of long and painstaking negotiations – sets out to respond. The report, for which we expressed our support, has established a regulatory framework which, taking as its basis more precise and detailed definitions, took into account all the actors, stages and aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain – safety, traceability and obligations of the distribution chain – in order to achieve a good compromise. These are some of the issues on which we must try to work in order to achieve the main goal of establishing more stringent standards and to prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, thus achieving a positive and more comprehensive regulatory framework that safeguards the health of citizens, protecting them from the risk of serious consequences.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease in particular, are an EU health priority. The disease in question has serious consequences for sufferers, and not just in health terms. The costs incurred for direct and informal care are, in fact, high. Indeed, Alzheimer’s disease affects not only the sufferers, but all those who care for them, too. Therefore, we need a European response to the problem, a coordinated response by all the Member States, a synergy of concerted measures that concern, in particular, the fields of science and research and that are responsible for strengthening prevention and diagnosis so as to improve the treatment – including innovative treatment – available, as well as the dissemination of information among the Member States on the results achieved nationally, thereby raising public awareness of the disease.

 Council Directive 1999/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens under various systems of rearing with the added objective of protecting against unfair competition among producers in the different Member States. Although I support the principles of this directive, it must not be taken lightly that, as things stand, a great many European producers – having begun the process of converting their facilities – have run into real problems in completing the transformation and risk not being ready before 1 January 2012, the final deadline for complying with the directive. If we also bear in mind the real difficulties faced by many producers in obtaining financing to support conversion processes and the serious economic difficulties that they are still having to deal with today – with serious repercussions on the stability of their businesses and employment levels – I am convinced that something has to be done. Member States should intervene to promote measures that can help European producers in the poultry farming sector who, aiming to adapt to the new European legislation, have embarked on the process of converting their facilities but are very unlikely to complete it before the start of 2012.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Fjellner aim to integrate and complete the existing European Union regulations on the subject, bringing them up to date and making them capable of tackling the challenges that technological development has created and poses for public health. In our opinion, at its centre is the patient and his or her right to be informed and have access to scientific information, which has now become both qualitatively and quantitatively better and must be monitored, starting with a more precise and accurate distinction between scientific information and advertising. Indeed, the reports use precise and standardised criteria to establish the types of information to be provided, which data are optional or not, as well as the channels through which they may be made available, thereby setting out the obligations of pharmaceutical companies and Member States. Based on this understanding, we express our support for this report, recognising its merits not only in terms of health but also in social terms. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I would like to express my appreciation for the important contribution that this work will make in identifying a set of measures to be taken to overcome the current crisis and prevent the possibility of further crises. After the limits of a system of self-regulation were highlighted to a worrying degree by the recent financial crisis, it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to choose a global control system. The current phase of economic and financial instability, the most severe for decades, has led to an employment and social crisis on such a scale that decisive action is required to eliminate its negative repercussions and prioritise the opportunities that open up in a globalised economy. The crisis in recent years has sorely tried most of the advanced economies. Recovery is still slow for some countries even today, and the ongoing fragility of financial markets makes global coordination and the choice of appropriate economic and industrial strategies key aspects in combating the financial crisis. Global supervision should, in fact, promote the stabilisation of solid financial markets and sustain the current recovery, guaranteeing strong growth in demand and employment levels. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measure sets out to reinforce and rationalise the system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union: these are the ambitious goals set by the McAvan reports, which aim to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC respectively. Thanks to a close and effective working relationship between the European Council and Parliament, and between the parliamentary committees responsible for this area, we have reached the point where we are able today to discuss a proposal that aims to improve the EU pharmacovigilance system, and to conclude the consistent work that the European Union has carried out in this field over more than a decade. Simplification, transparency and rationalisation may be considered the key points of these two reports, which propose measures aiming to guarantee the best possible protection of public health on the basis of standards that are harmonised throughout Europe. Reference is made to an extensive series of actions, ranging from better definition of the roles and responsibilities of the main national and international stakeholders seeking to ensure a new, more informed and active involvement of patients, who are given a fundamental role in the system, to the increased transparency of information concerning the safety of medicinal products and the simplification of activities involved in communicating, recording and evaluating suspected adverse reactions. The current pharmacovigilance system must also be improved through closer cooperation at European, national and regional levels. Effective participation at all three of these levels will, in fact, ensure a profitable exchange of information on the side effects of medicinal products. When reorganised as a network, with Internet support, the new pharmacovigilance system will be able to ensure a high level of information sharing and security to benefit patients, national authorities and healthcare professionals. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Thank you Mr President and excuse me. With my speech, I would like to highlight how the progressive erosion of European farmers’ incomes, despite growing profit margins for the agro-industrial sector, is causing a worrying economic marginalisation of agricultural workers, with the consequent abandonment of agricultural activities. This requires, therefore, a change of course, which the European Commission itself recognises and which the report being examined and put to the vote in Parliament this morning – for which I would like to express my support – highlights with ample explanations and suggestions on a legislative and departmental level as well. Indeed we must combat global speculation on commodities and guarantee the security of supply. Moreover, greater price transparency must also be guaranteed, not only to give farmers justice and dignity, but also to correct the serious imbalances that exist with regard to bargaining power and to prevent abusive practices between the various operators. Agriculture must be confirmed as a sector of economic and social stability and it must regain power in the European and in the globalised commercial context. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge of preventing pollution from industrial emissions is a very current problem that involves a number of areas, including, of course, environmental protection, public health and the competitiveness of businesses. Precisely in order to have an integrated approach to these important areas, the directive in question was specifically aimed at facilitating the implementation of the best available techniques for controlling emissions, with harmonised EU standards for the authorisation of industrial facilities being developed in order to protect the environment, which is frequently threatened and compromised by industrial emissions. However, it does all this while also taking account of the need, which is shared by our industries, to maintain the competitive edge that is necessary to overcome the challenges of the future. A significant political commitment and intense and patient mediatory action were required on this issue. Thanks to this action, we have finally been able to reach agreement at the third trialogue. For these reasons, I would like to express my support for this report. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight that the situation in Kyrgyzstan reflects a reality which, for too long, has not been given the importance it deserves. The reality I refer to is the instability in Central Asia, which is unfortunately increasing, while hopes for democracy and economic progress, at least in many of these countries, are especially fragile. In recent months, Kyrgyzstan has suffered as a result of harsh conflicts that will leave a legacy of interethnic strife, at least in the immediate future, making the stabilisation of that country even more difficult than it was in the past. As has already been said, the role of the international community and of the European Union in particular is to aid Kyrgyzstan as much as possible in three ways: firstly, by providing immediate aid for emergency supplies and rebuilding the damaged homes; secondly – as regards the European Union within the framework of the Central Asia strategy and the instruments implemented in that context – by providing financial aid that is as long term as possible; and, thirdly, by providing political support to aid the process of restoring constitutional order and the development of the rule of law. The constitutional referendum held in Kyrgyzstan on 28 June, in what were clearly very difficult conditions, may be regarded as the first step on the road to restoring constitutional order. The elections of 28 June also received the approval of the OSCE observation mission, which obviously took into account the special conditions in which the referendum was held. The new constitutional order in Kyrgyzstan will be directed more towards a parliamentary system than a presidential system. This will perhaps allow for greater recognition of the various ethnic groups in the country and of the need to obtain the consensus of the various groups in such a divided and composite country. The European Union and Kyrgyzstan are bound by a partnership and cooperation agreement that provides for regular meetings by a parliamentary cooperation committee. Our hope is that our inter-parliamentary relations will resume as soon as possible, with the participation of a democratically elected Kyrgyz parliament. As has already been said, in the immediate future, Kyrgyzstan needs stability and our political and financial support: let us not stint on either. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is being asked, as we know, to express a definitive opinion on food information to consumers. I should start by saying that this has unquestionably been a difficult, long and controversial legislative process, which could not have been shortened. The aim, in fact, is to harmonise European food legislation through regulations that will make information to consumers transparent, thereby preventing a situation in which they are led to make confused choices or choices that may even be harmful for their health. The report by Mrs Sommer, who must be thanked for her efforts in bringing together a large number of requirements, is therefore intended to provide a solution to the controversies and the differences between the consumer information systems in force in the Member States. It is not by chance that national regulations still differ in terms of how to describe the nature of foodstuffs for sale, creating a system that differs from one country to the next and also fuelling unfair competition, to the detriment of potential consumers. On the basis of the European Commission proposal, an attempt is therefore being made to revamp the current legislation by involving both the food industries and consumers. At the same time, the report obliges the European food industry to introduce some clarity into mandatory labelling, as well as the labelling and presentation of the nutritional value of foods. In a globalised market, the European Union could not escape the need to adapt and reform legislation on food products in order to protect the food trade, among other things, and to safeguard it from increasingly invasive and uncontrolled international competition. There is nothing new about the fact that we are hearing more and more about the dangers posed by food products that surreptitiously carry designations and statements that often do not meet dietary requirements but are nonetheless passed off as products that are good for human health.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the popular unrest that has broken out in recent days in the capital of Kyrgyzstan has halted the progress of the ‘Tulip Revolution’ that kindled hopes of democratic change in the former Soviet republic in 2005. The European Parliament is following the development of the political crisis in the country with great concern. This is not merely because of the country’s crucial geostrategic position for Russia and the United States, but also because the stability of Central Asia, its political and economic development and interregional cooperation is of interest to the EU, not least, due to the importance of Central Asia for our energy supplies and our economic and trade partnership. The risk of civil war breaking out and of a ‘second Afghanistan’ must be averted. We put our faith in the diplomatic mediation that the Presidents of the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan – the latter in his capacity as the current president of the OSCE – are deploying in their negotiations with the interim Kyrgyz Government for the establishment of public order and constitutional legality, in order that free elections can be held and the country’s problems resolved. As Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation, I hope, even despite the recent ethnic clashes, that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan.

The issue of an agricultural product quality policy has found an authoritative and unanimous response from the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby making the existing legislation more complete. European agricultural producers have finally gained recognition in European legislation on the quality of their produce linked to the region of production. This represents a guarantee for sheltering them from market globalisation and for ensuring that the ‘informed’ consumer can reject produce that does not bear the obligatory geographic indication of origin, that is not certified clearly, and that does not comply with marketing and anti-counterfeiting rules. Consumers will be able to make their purchasing choices in full knowledge of the rules relating to their desired product. The European Parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers. The health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former. An amendment of mine on the protection of product characteristics, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved, recognises that the regions have an essential role as producer partners, in particular, of the producers of traditional and organic products, and calls for regions to be involved in the recognition and promotion of products with a geographical indication, traditional products and organic products. I am pleased to note the recognition of this indication. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I congratulate the European Commission on having submitted to the Council the amended regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union. The report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up-to-date way, and does so for two reasons. The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively. The report is in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, in which particular attention is paid to energy policy by means of the strengthening and coordinating of its methods and of the investments required for the sector. The Copenhagen Summit’s failure to satisfy the world’s political leaders means that the policies to be pursued require a change of strategy. The European Parliament is paying particular attention to the problem with the aim of overseeing energy investments in the construction, transport and storage of associated energy products, so as to satisfy the production and distribution industries and hence safeguard consumers’ health. The second reason is that, since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand – like imports – is growing every day, EU energy policy must focus on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency.Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Donskis’s report on the European Union’s policy on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2011 for a number of reasons. The report highlights the importance of international humanitarian law (IHL), and particularly urges the EU to take a stronger stance in implementing IHL and considering it when entering into bilateral agreements with third countries. Not only is it important that the EU respect human rights, but we should do everything possible to ensure that basic standards of human rights are upheld in countries throughout the world, which the report directly encourages. Additionally, I support the inclusion of women’s rights in the report, as establishing human rights relies upon establishing equal rights between the sexes. Barbara Matera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I have drafted an opinion for Mr Ferreira’s report on small-scale and artisanal fisheries. There are still too many legal and social obstacles preventing women’s full participation at all levels in the fisheries sector. Women work on fishing boats and are involved at all levels of the production chain: in fish capture, in breeding and harvesting in aquaculture, and in processing and placing on the market; they are boat-owners; they organise fishing activities and provide support to the fishermen at sea. The work of women in the fisheries sector needs to be made more visible, especially in the artisanal sector, since 85 % of women active in this sector feel they are discriminated against. This is seen as an exclusively male sector: there are obstacles to women’s advancement and the support structures available are inadequate. I am pleased that Mr Ferreira has given due attention to this opinion and that Mr Damanaki has underlined the importance of cooperation between the Committee on Fisheries and the other parliamentary committees. I would therefore like to underline some of the priority actions to be taken at EU and Member State level. What is most important is the protection of the legal and social status of women working in the sector so as to ensure equal wages, in other words safeguarding social and economic rights. Above all insurance must be provided for covering risks at sea. Much has been done, but much more can be done. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Bové’s report on promotion measures and information provision for agricultural products because it expands an important and necessary portion of the common agricultural policy (CAP). While the CAP currently has several types of promotion measures in place, it is important to expand these measures to encourage economic growth in the agri-food sector. The European agri-food sector has the ability to prosper and assist economic stabilisation in the Member States, and developing more extensive promotion measures both for the internal European market and for external market shares. For these reasons, it is important that local, regional, and external promotion measures are adopted, with the focus placed on short food-supply chains and local farming systems. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 Children are increasingly more exposed to digital media through television programming and internet access, raising concerns about internet safety and harmful online content.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first and foremost to thank the rapporteur for having taken on board all – or most – of the points in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am Vice-Chair. Economic crises compromise efforts made towards gender equality: the employment rate among women falls ever lower and the gender pay gap grows ever wider. The contractual safeguards for many women and mothers are still precarious and the number of women in leadership positions and in the political, science and technology sectors is low. Adequate funding for EU programmes is necessary to reduce the gender pay gap and encourage access for women to highly skilled jobs. An increase in the labour market participation of women would free an important amount of talent that has remained untapped for many years. In the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we proposed uniform formats for women’s integration, and above all specific measures targeting vulnerable groups of women.

The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 come at a difficult economic and financial time, when the Member States are being forced to introduce harsh fiscal consolidation measures. However, the EU budget can only be seen as offering huge added value with regard to investments made at national level. The Commission’s proposal freezes ceilings at their 2013 levels and significantly weakens the requests made by the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 to strengthen European policies to enhance competitiveness, small and medium-sized enterprises and sustainable infrastructure. Parliament hopes for a ‘responsible’ reaction from the Council. Any attempt to reduce the ceilings proposed by the Commission would result not only in a decline in effectiveness but also in the credibility of the EU budget. Barbara Matera  (PPE

I voted in favour of the proposal of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to designate 2013 as the European Year of Citizens. I believe that it is vitally important to raise awareness among European Union citizens of their rights and guarantees, as enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Year of Citizens is intended to increase the active civic and democratic participation of Union citizens. As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I support this proposal because I hope that it will not only reinforce equality and solidarity among the Member States, but will also enhance gender equality among citizens and increase the participation of women in the economic, political and social life of the European Union. I also regard this decision as extremely important in terms of increasing the mobility of workers and the resulting employment rate. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Ms Parvanova’s report on the minimum standards on the rights, support, and protection of victims of crime because it draws necessary attention to an issue that needs to be addressed by the EU. First and foremost, the provisions will establish uniformity throughout the EU for victims’ rights and protection, ensuring all victims of crime will be treated in the same way regardless of the Member State in which they are located. Notably, the report encourages the individual assessment of a victim’s needs, particularly those with specific needs, when determining the methodology of protection. It recognises the unique nature of gender-based discrimination and urges particular protection for those who are repeat victims of crime. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 as a support system for workers impacted by global structural change in trade patterns. Denmark’s application in respect of the Odense Steel Shipyard notes that the country’s workforce is highly concentrated in manufacturing and metallurgy, but has lost business because many global market shares have been transferred to Asia. By mobilising the EGF with an amount of EUR 6 455 104, workers will be helped to return to the labour market, which is especially important because these employees have highly specialised training in their field which it is nearly impossible to apply in other industries. For these reasons, I voted in favour of Mr Bendtsen’s report. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– Spain’s application for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the construction sector in the NUTS II region of Aragón addresses redundancies caused by the current economic crisis. The financial and economic crisis has greatly impacted Spain’s construction industry due to a lack of demand for new construction. This trend is in line with the falling demand for new construction that exists throughout Europe, but the condition of the housing market has degraded at an even more rapid pace in Spain. A mobilisation of the EGF for an amount of EUR 1 300 000 will allow workers that had been employed in construction to diversify their skills, which will alleviate some of the burden of unemployment in Aragón. I voted in favour of Mr Escobar’s report for these reasons. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Gustafsson’s report on the role of women in the green economy, as developing the green economy involves creating new jobs, in particular, for prevalently male sectors where the participation of women is still limited. By analysing data and statistics regarding different employment areas in the European Union, I noted with regret that a high concentration of ‘green’ jobs are normally filled by men. In most cases, women involved in the transition linked to new job opportunities are underpaid compared with men. The disparities in access to different green trades and professions are a threat to the equality of the transition towards a greener labour market. To facilitate women’s access to new ‘green’ jobs, I would argue it is vital for the Commission and Member States to organise specialist training courses in areas such as renewable energy, thereby giving women real opportunities to join the labour market in remote areas where unemployment affects young people in particular. I am referring, for example, to the potential for women to succeed in the area of solar and wind power in southern Europe. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the report because I believe that protecting the geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs has undoubted advantages for consumers and producers.

 Consular protection for citizens abroad (in accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 46 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) operates both for day-to-day matters and for emergency situations. Emergency situations are arising in an increasing number of contexts and for this reason the simplification of access to rights and better knowledge of these among citizens is desirable, so that they are in a better position to benefit from solidarity between Member States if their own country is not directly represented in the third country or if they are having difficulties reaching their own embassy. For this reason I am in favour of the report, though I recognise that further action and future clarifications will be necessary, for example concerning the role and functions of the delegations and the definition of the necessary financial resources to ensure they can be implemented.

Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Foster’s report, which calls for strong action from the Commission, including sanctions, in order to force Member States that are violating their obligations under the Single European Sky (SES) legislation to fall into line. The SES is an ambitious project aimed at creating a single airspace that would allow increased capacity and efficiency in air traffic management, also bringing economic and environmental benefits. The implementation of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research programme, which is the technological pillar of the SES project, is a vital aspect for its success, especially from 2015 on, when the program should be launched. Unfortunately, there are still several gaps in the single airspace project, particularly with regard to the realisation of Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB). In this regard, I welcome the new impetus given a few days ago by Italy and other countries involved in the ‘Blue Med’ FAB, which is of strategic value since it involves the Southern Mediterranean countries.

Madam President, passenger rights are central to the debate on transport. The concept of accessibility is the cardinal point of this report, including physical accessibility for all to destinations and information. Correct information must be available to travellers, using various means and covering a range of needs. Furthermore, passengers must have access to assistance through helpdesks with adequately trained and competent staff. Finally we call for revision of the Package Travel Directive 90/314/EEC, in order to ensure that consumers and firms in the sector have a clear legal framework for both standard situations and exceptional situations, eliminating abusive and unfair practices and ensuring greater transparency. Mr Bach’s report addresses all of these aspects and I therefore voted in favour of it. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I welcome Mr Simpson’s report. Suitable and up-to-date training of crews is essential for ensuring safety on board ships. Training should therefore comply with international standards, and be standardised, in order to overcome problems often posed by the presence on board a given ship of workers from different countries and trained according to different systems. All actions aimed at upholding safety in the sector must be regarded as essential, in particular the strengthening of provisions on issuance of certificates of competence, medical fitness and fitness for duty, and the proposals on better working conditions and control of alcohol abuse. It is essential to aim for greater involvement of the Commission through greater transparency, and for easier access to information in order to a provide fuller picture of the employment situation in this sector.

I believe that simpler and faster registration procedures will encourage farmers to register their quality products and ingredients and to communicate their added value more effectively to customers, who will thus be in a position to make more informed choices. The role of foodstuff producer groups – by which I mean all producers, processors or producer-processors – is important, and they will be able to take steps to protect their own trade names and to promote the authenticity and reputation of their goods.

 I welcome the resolution on the proposals regarding a European banking union. The fact that we are voting on this resolution the day after the Commission tabled two proposals to enhance banking supervision shows that Parliament – the only democratically elected EU institution – is keen to make a major contribution to putting together the instruments that will give the Union and the single currency greater stability, without negative repercussions for Member States that are not part of the euro area. In my view, it is essential that we achieve a fully functioning European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as soon as possible, which, although it certainly further limits Member State sovereignty over public finances, at least has the benefit of excluding the contributions they pay from the calculation of their sovereign debts.

 The resolution on the alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in European countries by the CIA focuses on an issue that continues to cause controversy, including in Italy. Collating flight data managed by Eurocontrol suggests that there is an illegal system that has led to suspicious disappearances, which is unacceptable. All responsibilities need to be established so that there is no recurrence of similar cases in the future. The fight against terrorism in the EU should be conducted in compliance with EU law and the sovereignty of the Member States, which have the right and the duty to prosecute those suspected of terrorism and bring them to trial.

 I am dissatisfied by today’s vote on beef labelling. Although it was only by a few votes, we were unable to keep voluntary labelling. A specific request from the entire Italian supply chain, which rightly expressed concern, given that abolition involves a financial loss for farmers – many have already invested in and successfully use this tool – as well as a competitive disadvantage compared with other markets, as Italian production is characterised by its quality. The fact that the rapporteur has decided to refer the text back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) bodes well, considering that in Council, a majority block may form to reintroduce compulsory labelling systems to defend the principles of quality and traceability.

 I welcome the vote on Mr Dorfmann’s report, which aims to safeguard an important sector and one which is an area of excellence for Italy and for Europe. Parliament is granting more flexibility to Member States so that the sector can also take definitive decisions before the entry into force of the common agricultural policy (CAP) 2014-2020 reform, which we are working hard on at the moment. With today’s vote, we are pursuing the objective of giving greater flexibility to Member States so that they can decide on the national financial envelope of the wine sector, all of which is linked to the proposal for direct payments under the new CAP.

 The huge delays in adapting the package of basic regulations on the common agricultural policy (CAP) to the Treaty of Lisbon are down to the Council’s intransigence and the deferral of the Polish Presidency, which prevented us from finalising the agreements that had earlier been made. Today, we once again find ourselves faced not just with the old regulations in the package, but also with new texts on the CAP and with voting on alignment to the Treaty of Lisbon, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in April 2011. The changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon – abolishing the old comitology system, allowing the Commission to exercise implementation and enforcement powers that amend the role of the Council, which, acting on a proposal by the Commission, can adopt measures to set prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations – show us the important role of Parliament even more. Accordingly, we need to align the body of laws to the new framework, bringing in an alternative system that is in keeping with Articles 290 and 291 and allows Parliament to act to protect farmers, land, products and agricultural markets.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached with the Council has resulted in some significant improvements. I am thinking of the establishment of strong, independent national regulators to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, which is one of the key points of the recast; the minimum five-year term for contracts between Member States and infrastructure managers, which will allow for better long-term investment planning; and the major focus on safety, both in terms of rolling stock maintenance, an important distinction being made between light and heavy maintenance, and in terms of the technological modernisation of infrastructure and trains to improve safety (particularly through the European Rail Traffic Management System). In short, the net outcome is positive overall, although one crucial point for the completion of the single rail market remains unresolved, which is the opening up of national rail passenger traffic. I hope the Commission will keep up the momentum it developed a few months ago and will put forward a new proposal in that respect by the end of the year. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text we have adopted today provides a good basis for starting negotiations with the Council. I am certain that this innovative instrument will lead to improvements in road safety, drivers’ working conditions and competition in the sector. I am particularly pleased regarding the amendment that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on joint liability. I believe it should be possible to hold any operator in the transport sector liable for infringements of the regulation in question, and not just road haulage companies and their drivers. The text also calls for smart tachographs to be fitted to all vehicles, old and new, by 2020. This requirement will certainly entail a major effort by companies in the sector, but it is equally important to remain ambitious and gradually install digital tachographs even in those vehicles that use analogue ones. A final critical point is, I believe, the definition of ‘daily working period’. In my view, it is not consistent with other definitions given in existing legislation, particularly with regard to a driver’s rest periods or breaks, which would remain part of the working period according to this definition.

 Parliament’s adoption of the report recommending deployment of the eCall system is a clear signal of its support for the topic of road safety. Every year in Europe, there are more than 40 000 fatalities on the roads. By means of the eCall system, it is anticipated that this number could be reduced by more than 2 500, with a reduction of 10-15% in the number of injured, thanks to an increase of 40-50% in the speed and efficiency of response centres. Furthermore, it is important to remember that eCall will have minimal economic repercussions on final costs, which amount to about EUR 100 per vehicle – a perfectly reasonable price given the great benefits it will bring. It is now essential that the Member States and the respective mobile phone networks commit themselves to improving their infrastructure so as to guarantee this service to the maximum extent possible. As of now, 5 500 drivers have use of such a service in 10 countries: the positive effects achievable from 2015 with its introduction in all 27 Member States would be of vital importance.

 It is currently difficult for the consumer as well as supervisory bodies to distinguish between normal food products and those designed for specific groups. The reasons for this ambiguity could be differences in the interpretation and application of rules by Member States. That is why I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s report: we need a legislative reorganisation, with uniform laws that guarantee innovation, competitiveness of businesses and protection of information for citizens. The European Union must commit to achieving uniform treatment in the area of food so as to provide greater legal, economic and social certainty, covering not just the goods consumed and produced within the European Union but also those which are exported and imported. In this sense the regulatory provisions on gluten and lactose are of paramount importance as they are aimed at protecting an ever-growing section of the population. Figures show that food-related conditions are becoming more and more common, causing an increase in depression, stress and general poor health: let us help make these people’s complicated lives easier.

 In the Treaty on European Union, the Member States pledged to safeguard the principles of democracy and respect for human rights. Clearly all candidate countries must have satisfied these conditions before negotiations begin, but this does not imply indifference to conditions outside the EU. The last few years have been extremely dramatic for Tibet and the people of this nation have given a strong and succinct message: after 50 years of Chinese occupation, Tibetans are calling on the world for real change – a change that includes dialogue with the Chinese leadership, not an intensification of violence. The strategic partnership between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China should be based on common principles and values: the latter’s great economic dependence on exports ‘Made in China’ and the importance China attaches to its international reputation can influence such a change, if we make the effort. To guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, freedom of speech and association and the release of political prisoners, we need to take concrete action. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Gender-based violence and all forms of harassment and exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be wiped out. Full and equal participation of women in civil, social, cultural, economic and political life, and elimination of any kind of discrimination are the prime objectives of the international community. Protection of women’s rights has received a significant boost thanks to international instruments and commitments from the United Nations and the European Union. I think we are all in agreement that female genital mutilation is a serious form of abuse and torture of children and, I must specify, children from the age of just four. Today too many women are still subjected to these practices, which cause psychological trauma, indescribable physical suffering and repercussions on their health and which cannot be justified by tradition or as a symbol of identity. Ladies and gentlemen, we must all say a loud ‘no’ to female genital mutilation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this resolution. I must say that I am very sad to see the negative repercussions of this social depression, if we can call it that, and I am firmly convinced that we must act promptly to avoid a worsening of the global economy. The Treaty requires economic matters to be seen as an issue of common interest, with policies inspired by the need for healthy finances that cannot compromise the functioning of the economic and monetary union. The Stability Pact itself highlights the need to create incentives for prudent budgets, obviously avoiding excessive public deficits and strengthening surveillance. This surveillance allows us to identify risks as well as possible and take responsibility promptly. As the Commission has said, the EU must take shared responsibility, which I think also involves risk sharing. That is the only way we will be able to ensure coordinated and well monitored budgets.

 I voted in favour of this regulation. The main reason for doing so was that, for the first time, we saw a legislative text that really lays the groundwork for new and essential mechanisms for securing sovereign debts and building towards growth. Here, contrary to the view of my group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – I had no hesitation in voting in favour of eurobonds and the redemption fund. I voted in favour of the amendment on the golden rule, which would exclude investments from deficit calculations, and I regret that it was not carried. The way things are now, it is time to take urgent action: no more blind austerity; we have seen that it cannot work by itself. We need to mutualise debt while calling for austerity and, above all, we need to support growth before it is too late.

 I voted in favour of the reports by Francesca Balzani. Following flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied for assistance to the European Union; the disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). I would remind you that the Solidarity Fund should be mobilised mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on the living conditions, environment or economy of one or more regions of a Member State. The conditions in the affected areas worsened, as always happens in these situations, because of the tragedy of the lives lost, the large number of wounded people, the families who lost everything and the very serious damage to homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructures. In these regions, the use of the EUR 18 million released by the fund will therefore help our fellow citizens to regain the peace of mind that they have sadly lost. Finally, let me congratulate the volunteers of the Italian Civil Protection Agency who, in those weeks, as well as currently in Emilia and Lombardy and as always in the past, have shown professionalism and humanity.

 I voted in favour of the reports by Mr Fernandes. Following the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied to the European Union for assistance. The disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the Solidarity Fund. I would point out that this fund should intervene mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on living conditions, the environment or the economy in one or more regions of a Member State. Conditions in the affected areas were made worse, as always happens in these cases, owing to the tragic loss of human life, the high number of injured people, the families who lost everything and severe damage to residential homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. Therefore, deploying in these regions the EUR 18 million granted from the fund will help our fellow citizens regain the peace of mind which, unfortunately, they have lost. Lastly, allow me to praise the Italian Civil Protection volunteers who, during those weeks, demonstrated professionalism and humanity, just as they have done in recent days in Emilia-Romagna and in Lombardy, and always have done in the past.

Following the visibility acquired through the European Year of Volunteering, it is appropriate to focus on specific measures to further promote volunteering.

Its creation will make an invaluable and much-needed contribution to society, demonstrating the need to build a Europe based on respect for fundamental rights and the creation of solidarity and welfare, not just within national borders and not just in economic terms. In a constantly changing society such as that in Europe, enhancing solidarity is an asset. It enables us to address and overcome human, social, intergenerational and environmental needs and concerns.

 The conditions under which former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has, for months, been imprisoned and suffered various forms of physical and psychological violence are unacceptable. First of all, we must urge the Ukrainian authorities to ensure full adherence to the fundamental rights of their prisoners, guaranteeing fair treatment, adequate medical assistance in an appropriate facility, unrestricted visits by relatives and sufficient access to their lawyers. This situation affects the relationship between the EU and Ukraine; I therefore consider that the authorities in Kiev should not ignore what we are saying in this Parliament, which is yet another position statement following on from numerous interventions from the highest officials of the European institutions and Member States.

I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe, as I believe that we should not confuse homophobia, which is of course unacceptable, with family law. As the interpretation of the European Court of Justice confirms, there is not, and there should not be, a single family model, but rather we acknowledge the diversity of national legal schemes, thus excluding the possibility of predominance by EU sources. The European Union, in fact, is a community made up of 27 Member States, 27 different cultures, and 27 different traditions, and we have to protect unity in diversity, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The European Union’s task is to foster the harmonisation, rather than the uniformity, of family law. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

As we all know, the global financial crisis, which started in 2008, has had terrible consequences and repercussions, affecting the real economy almost immediately. The discrepancy between consumer demand and supply has had devastating effects on employment too, thus giving rise to serious problems on the labour market. Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and responsibility to combat the crisis. Among the various measures to be taken is the reinforcement of the single market’s stability through the introduction of innovative strategies, designed to achieve growth that is not just economic, but also social. I think that fiscal consolidation through the introduction of a common system of taxation for financial transactions could have positive effects on the single market, and for that reason, I voted for Ms Podimata’s report. There could be several positive effects. However, I would argue that precisely because of the now highly globalised nature of the financial sector and its services, a further shift should be made, by promoting the introduction of a worldwide financial transaction tax: firstly, the full 27 Member States and then the G20 should demonstrate cohesion in seeking this objective.

 I am voting in favour of Rita Borsellino’s report to strengthen the European Union’s internal security strategy. Over the last 30 years, a succession of serious events, such as natural disasters and terrorist and mafia atrocities, has profoundly shaken public opinion, thus hindering economic development, undermining the political integrity of the countries affected, and eroding trust between citizens and institutions. To regain this trust, a broader synergy must be created between social and institutional agents to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of respect for fundamental rights. It is no longer useful to examine social phenomena in a local context; we now need to look beyond national boundaries. We must ensure security by maintaining existing strategies and finding innovate ways to supplement them: to be credible, we must earn the trust of the European peoples and address their needs more effectively.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are essential transport nodes and factors that contribute to growth and territorial cohesion. Frequently, however, they only survive thanks to massive injections of public money. Nowadays, this is increasingly scarce, and therefore it is important that they should have a specific vocation in order to avoid a proliferation that would lead to non-utilisation or under-utilisation of the airport infrastructure. A typical example of this is the scores of airports in northern Italy located just 20-30 kilometres from one another. At the moment, there is no precise definition for a regional airport, and the Commission should therefore set common criteria for a proper definition. Finally, I am concerned about the formulation regarding the scope of application and, in particular, the exclusion of airports whose principal catchment area is a capital city. I do not think it is correct as a catchment area is not uniform and can change. Despite these critical points, I voted in favour in order to draw the Commission’s attention to these important airports. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approval of this resolution is a very important political signal in the fight against maritime piracy. Paragraph 30 of the resolution I proposed specifies that in the event of disputes between countries following military action aiming to combat piracy attacks in international waters, the national jurisdiction of the flag state shall be applied on the ships concerned as well as on the military staff employed aboard, as provided by international law. This aspect is crucial for avoiding future controversies like the one currently ongoing between Italy and India, and to defend the prerogatives of military personnel deployed in Operation Atalanta and as Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) on merchant vessels. I dedicate the approval of this text to Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, the two Italian sailors unjustly detained for almost three months in prison in India waiting for India to decide to acknowledge Italian jurisdiction and to allow these two soldiers to be judged by the Italian courts.

In order to promote the development of world trade, the 27 Member States drew up a common trade policy with third countries in an attempt to abolish trade restrictions and excessive tariffs. This trade liberalisation does not imply the non-respect of rights and obligations by commercial partners operating on an international level.

 I welcome Ms Niebler’s proposal on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union. Now, with the major increase in mobility within the Union and the concurrent major developments in the telecoms sector, we cannot ask our citizens to take on the burden of excessively high costs, especially for data roaming. I therefore support the further lowering of roaming charges – tariffs that ensure complete transparency and consumer protection. I believe that these new measures, in force from 1 July 2012 and running at full speed from 1 July 2014, giving customers the chance to choose a different roaming services provider from their national operator, will encourage a greater number of operators to compete, further reducing tariffs.

 I voted in favour of the report because it points out the need for enhanced legal certainty, more interpretative clarity and uniform application of the regulations across the EU regarding the rights of air passengers, including those with reduced mobility. Greater and more effective cooperation among the different actors must be secured so as to ensure that passenger rights are protected and to clarify their various responsibilities. It is also important to clarify and strengthen existing rights and to ensure that consumers are made aware of them. Knowledge of rights is essential in ensuring that passengers can access them. That is why information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey, starting from when the passenger is considering whether to purchase a ticket. To help ensure that rights are upheld, there should be contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues that arise when flight disruptions occur.

In this sense, Serbia is in a position to become an important player in guaranteeing security and stability in the region.

As well as the profound cultural differences and the fact that Turkey does not totally belong to the European continent, I am also not convinced by its progress made towards what is considered a European model, from which it is still very far in many different ways, including its under-developed democracy, its still insufficient safeguarding of human and civil rights, the still unresolved issue of Cyprus and the military, cultural and economic repression of the Kurdish minority. An acceptable choice would be to create a privileged partnership without seeking integration at all costs, which, in many ways, does not make sense. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution calling on Russia, as an important partner of the European Union, to open substantial dialogue with the demonstrators in defence of the principles of democracy and transparency. President Medvedev should match deeds to words and guarantee the adoption of the necessary reforms of the political system and make a serious commitment to address the numerous problems of media freedom and freedom of assembly and expression. Parliament supports this improvement and, should it be necessary, offers its cooperation, especially as regards respect for, and the reinforcement and protection of, fundamental human rights.

 I voted in favour of the proposal because it increases Community cofinancing for the countries facing the greatest difficulties, with a corresponding reduction in the national effort required in order to take up funding. This whole issue is very important and today’s vote finally takes stock of that fact. We must remember that the coastal communities most heavily dependent on fisheries have not escaped the current crisis, on top of which we must unfortunately consider the problems caused by years of decline and disintegration.

 I voted in favour of the proposal because it aims to bring 26 trade policy regulations into line with the new primary-law provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. For example, the legislature will be able to delegate non-essential legislative acts to the executive, while retaining the power to revoke the delegation at any time. The affected measures are mostly designed to allow the use of trade safeguard regulations, apart from the regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. The Commission is proposing changes only where the Council decisions specifically provided for have previously applied. As a result of these specific decision-making procedures, European trade policy has hitherto, essentially, been explicitly excluded from the comitology procedures. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, these special arrangements have now been terminated. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the general guidelines for the 2013 budget, since they take note of the economic crisis afflicting Europe and propose serious and decisive measures for our future, such as the need for reinforcing the collective effort to carry out the actions already undertaken, specific actions and greater budgetary efforts to promote growth and employment. It is vital to support competitiveness with investments that would create jobs, above all, for young people, whose education, mobility and IT skills make them the main actors in achieving the future results we hope to obtain with the Europe 2020 strategy.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must note with regret the absence of Baroness Ashton from this debate. It would have been important for all of us to hear directly from her the latest updates on the situation involving the two Italian marines unjustly imprisoned in India after being arrested following the military operation against piracy in which they were involved. I am sorry not to be able to hear Baroness Ashton speak, and I hope that Mr Piebalgs’s response will provide more precise details about the progress made in the last few days. This is not just an Italian issue, it is very much a European issue, because – you see – the exclusive jurisdiction of the country flying the flag is a universally recognised principle of international law, and the Indian authorities having brought it into doubt risks undermining the very heart of the battle against piracy by the international community and the European Union itself, which, as we have said, is involved in the Atalanta mission. Therefore, I appeal to the EU institutions to make all possible diplomatic efforts to repatriate our soldiers, ensure international law is upheld and make sure that they are the subject of a fair and transparent investigation in their country of origin. In addition, Madam President, I would like to comment on the many speeches I have heard from my fellow Members from the radical left. Frankly, I am convinced that Europe must be committed on a political and diplomatic level to help Somalia and all struggling countries to develop, but this cannot be a sufficient response to the hundreds of hostages and families waiting for their loved ones to come home, who are tired of talk and want practical solutions in the matter of international security.

 I voted against the motion for a resolution, from the European Parliament’s left-leaning parties, on Hungary as I consider it to be a shameful fabrication, especially given the openness of the Hungarian Government as regards the points highlighted by the European Commission. Furthermore, the adoption of this resolution could have a counterproductive effect, undermining the Hungarian people’s confidence in the European Union. This is a situation to be avoided, especially during this period of growing euroscepticism. More generally, we are faced with a completely cynical political attack against a government legitimately elected with a large majority and that is proudly protecting the rights and the sovereignty of its own people.

 Digital citizenship is a fundamental part of the European Union, and necessary for producing well-informed players in the electronic processes of democracy. The first issue we need to address is that of the digital divide and in particular the protection of the least-protected groups, including minors. The adoption of the report on protecting children in the digital world lays the foundations for a more organic framework directive that includes all the measures concerning children in previous EU legislation. It is undoubtedly necessary to encourage action to combat online crime, which has been successfully adopted by some Member States. But the cultural and legal differences among Member States make it hard to establish clearly which content should be penalised. Self-regulation adopted so far has proven useful, but has demonstrated limits that must be corrected with a unified framework of rights that tackles conduct that could have serious consequences for young Europeans. Thanks to this report, we are on the way to greater uniformity of intervention. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate before this one was on the 20th anniversary of the single market. We had that debate because the single market is one of the European Union’s main goals. If the single market were to fail, the entire European Union could fail. The same is true of Erasmus: for many young people – and not only for them – it represents the image of the European Union. Without Erasmus, many people’s perception of European unity would disappear. This is more the case than with the single market because with the single market there is also, but not only, an economic advantage for businesses and for our countries. There is nothing wrong with this, but Erasmus is different, it is about students wanting to break out of their confines and discover the cultures of other countries, share the experience of studying with people who speak a different language and perhaps have different customs and traditions, and discover, renew and strengthen our common identity and our unity. This is how Europe came into being, not through treaties or dreadful bureaucracy, but through genuine lived experiences. Perhaps without Erasmus, the single market would also mean something different, the spirit of it would be different and so weakening Erasmus could weaken our Union. The title of this debate is absolutely right: Erasmus is in danger, and the danger is that, without Erasmus, a different concept of Europe would develop. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and to tell the Council to make a real effort to find and authorise the funds, since the hole that exists is down to the Member States. The Europe of the future will depend on those who want to study and have experiences abroad now. Let us try not to let them down and let us be brave enough to show what Europe is really made of. I wish the Council good luck with its work and hope to hear only good news! Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, the Year of European Citizens is a way of focusing attention on the half a billion people living in the EU. It is a way of remembering that all of the other measures we are discussing in these days – the banking union, the economic and financial measures for combating the crisis – have the interests of citizens as their primary objective. The aim of the European Year on which we have voted is to enhance the rights attached to Union citizenship and the role played by the associations in the Union, reinforcing the right of students, teachers, artists and those working creatively to move freely. In short, it aims to strengthen European identity through concrete initiatives in which the citizens play the leading role. This is a real bottom-up approach to building the Union, and the reason why I voted in favour. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this rather wonderful report by Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, which we in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) helped to improve. The reasons for such praise lie, above all, in the acknowledgement of copyright as the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creation, investment and production. Dissemination of works, following their digitisation, is the main way to protect and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage. The European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, but much of it lies unused in the archives and libraries of our Member States, totally inaccessible to citizens. It is therefore right to make these works as accessible as possible to all. Indeed, the EU’s true wealth is its cultural heritage, which is unequalled around the world but is often neglected and loses not only its cultural value, but its economic value as well. The compromise reached between protecting copyright and allowing public access is the best way to reverse this trend and breathe fresh life into our cultural heritage, without violating any rights. It is true that perhaps not all the goals have been met, yet the glass is surely half-full rather than half-empty. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Schengen is an asset to Europe. Breaking down barriers between Member States was the first sign of something new that was starting to take shape: no more barriers but unity; no more controls but solidarity between states, which are no longer divided but united in a single great Union. That is why it is odd to hold this debate today. We seem to have taken a step backwards and it appears that we are abandoning the foundations of our fine Union. If Schengen fails, the European Union fails, but if Schengen is so important it should be protected, as precious things are. It should be protected from a Council that thinks it can bypass Parliament’s prerogatives, but it should also be protected from anything that can call Schengen itself into question. External border control should therefore be strengthened with all the legislative and technological instruments we have because, if our borders are at risk of becoming porous, this automatically makes our Member States less flexible, and they could call for stricter control, even within our borders, to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants. We cannot allow that and for that I thank Commissioner Malmström for all her work and her future collaboration on this issue. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on macro-regional strategies, especially with regard to the Mediterranean. Macro-regions have given a good account of themselves, which is why, at an historic time such as this, the Mediterranean, too, needs to be given a major development boost. The Mediterranean can become a place where culture, education, training, tourism, trade, environmental protection, transport and fishing can all come together to make this area take off, in conjunction with the ensuing Arab Spring. Tourism brings wealth, as does trade; education brings democracy and job creation; while culture, with its artists, shows us how we are all united and gives us a view of what we could become. All these factors make the Mediterranean important, particularly for all the other areas of Europe and the Middle East in general. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we decided to table this oral question because the issue is particularly important. We have always strived to bring citizens closer to the EU institutions. We do so in many ways, through the visitors to Parliament, through our local actions, using all the means of communication that our timescales allow us. We do this with constant echoes in all our resolutions; we do so, too, with the Commission’s public consultations. The Commission often uses these consultations to form the basis of their communications to Parliament and other EU institutions. In other words, the Commission bases its work on the responses it gets. Where, then, is the problem? The problem is that often, the results of these consultations are objectively embarrassing. A few dozen answers, sometimes even just single figures, representing the half a billion citizens that make up the European Union. Truly embarrassing. In 2011, the Commission had already committed to reviewing its consultation policy but to date, that is, mid-2012, we have neither seen nor heard anything. It is not a matter of lengthening timescales: we could even do it for 365 days, but the results would be the same. One of the most obvious problems is the use of languages. We very seldom go beyond the use of English, and hardly ever use any other languages apart from English, French and German. My mother could never take part in the consultations because she does not know any of the three languages in question and many of our citizens are in a similar position to her. It is not just a matter of ignorance, it is also a matter of the values we believe in and on which we have based our Union. Multilingualism, Commissioner, is one of them. Of course it is important to be competent in languages, but we have 23 of them, and why should a Portuguese, an Italian or a Lithuanian not find out about the Commission’s consultation in their own language? Of course, the lack of answers does not only depend on language but we have to start somewhere. Language is not only a great place to start but, Commissioner, also becomes a priority because, if we were to continue in this way, we might just as well make savings at the root by abolishing this instrument since we are making such a terrible impression. I want to conclude with a question to you, Commissioner: if you were in charge of a communication company, would the results of this communication satisfy you and your company? Marco Scurria,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this resolution is very important because, until just a few months ago, volunteering was an object of mystery for the European Union. Even though it involved 100 million volunteers responsible for 5% of GDP, the sector did not actually appear to exist. Then, despite a series of difficulties, we managed to dedicate last year, 2011, to volunteering and we all began to pick up on its excellent potential. Member States that did not have legislation on this issue have adopted legislation, others have updated theirs, many have increased the activities carried out by voluntary associations and, especially at a time of crisis like the one we are experiencing, have assigned an important role – a subsidiary role, as it is referred to – to the non-profit world. We started off from this point to accentuate the role of volunteering in the European Union, as shown by the report we are debating this evening. We started off with an excellent communication from the Commission, whom I thank for their work, as I thank the shadow rapporteurs and officials of the groups and Parliament who helped me draw up the report. What have we set out? First, a portal to tell citizens about the volunteering opportunities in various Member States and how to get involved. Next, use of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Manual on the Measurement of Volunteer Work and the United Nations Handbook on Non-Profit Institutions with a view to making available comparable statistics and data providing a clear picture of the significant contribution made by volunteering and of the needs of volunteers throughout the European Union. We want to give volunteering a high profile in sport, particularly at the grassroots level. We would like to recognise the important contribution also made by volunteering to protecting the environment, and to support volunteering activities in environmental education, crisis prevention and management, as well as in defending artistic and cultural heritage. We support the Commission’s proposal to establish a European Skills Passport, so that the skills acquired through volunteering may be officially recognised, both for professional and for learning purposes. A passport that should be a comprehensive document listing all practical experience, training and soft and vocational skills acquired through lifelong learning, including those gained through volunteering, if desired by the volunteer. We urge the Commission to put this European Skills Passport in place as soon as possible. We also support the Commission’s proposal to create a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which will increase the participation of volunteers in solidarity actions in the context of the humanitarian aid policy throughout the EU. We wish to ensure adequate and stable funding and establish and simplify administrative procedures, including tax incentives, for the organisations involved in volunteering work, including associations and networks, particularly for small associations with limited resources, with a view to enhancing their roles, activities and achievements as they provide such benefits to society. As Henry de Montherlant used to say, ‘Selfless acts are the stars of the earth’. Volunteering work has this capability. With its activity, provided free of charge, it can bring the stars onto our earth and plant them firmly into the soil. Our flag, Mr President, is made up of stars, which is why the EU must not fail to strengthen the voluntary sector and its world made up of great little everyday gestures. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I think it is a positive first step towards bringing order to EU-China relations, which are clearly imbalanced. The EU is founded on certain fundamental values. For example, we rightly ask our businesses to respect the environment; we give importance to workers’ rights, first and foremost, women’s rights; we do not make children work; and we do not have concentration camps with free labour. In China, however, all this protection and these rights do not exist. Far from it! There are still barriers to European goods accessing the Chinese market, and goods are clearly produced there at a lower cost, resulting in unfair competition with European companies and goods. We must establish true reciprocity in relations with countries outside the EU so that, where there are causes for imbalance, they are offset by financial and trade provisions that safeguard our businesses and our goods. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think there could be a better day on which to hold this debate. Today is Europe Day, when we celebrate the idea of uniting 27 countries to date, creating a single market, a common currency for many of our Member States, ongoing cultural and educational exchange; an exchange, in short, of feelings of greater togetherness and closeness. What medium unites us more these days than that of communication? A single internal telecommunications market cannot, in fact, be said to exist without telecommunications and if significant differences remain between domestic and roaming prices. Therefore, the ultimate aim we have set ourselves is also the hypothetical one of being able to eliminate the difference between domestic charges and roaming charges, thus establishing an internal market for mobile communications services. It is one of the aims that we must set ourselves. In this way, competition will improve, and people will be protected. It is an economic saving, because high roaming charges always constitute an impediment to the Union’s efforts to develop into a knowledge-based economy and to the realisation of an internal market of 500 million consumers. That is not all. The creation of a European social, educational, cultural and entrepreneurial area, based on the mobility of individuals and digital data, should facilitate communication between people in order to attain our aim, which is to build a real ‘Europe for Citizens’. For these reasons, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for her skill and her great capabilities at mediation, but most of all, for having attained the aims that have been achieved, given the importance of this issue. Obviously, I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are here because – as we have also heard here in this House – we are also celebrating our Europe, an institution created to bring together what are now 27 countries, to create a single market, to give some of these countries a single currency, and to bring together countries with the same vision and the same plans for the future, for culture, education, and much more. One of the key words of this Union is solidarity. Today, the basis for this debate is what has happened in Sicily, what has happened in Lampedusa, including in recent months. However, this situation is clearly not restricted to Sicily or Lampedusa alone; it is something that concerns Malta, and has concerned and still concerns Spain. Consequently, if this solidarity does unite 27 countries and wants to unite 27 countries, it must be seen and it must be felt. It is a solidarity that sometimes has not been felt by these countries, which sometimes have felt alone and abandoned when it comes to quite serious problems taking place on their coasts. Today, however, we need to develop these aspects, we need to develop the tools that allow us to monitor our coastlines, and we also need to establish bilateral agreements with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, agreements that will allow us to avoid migration flows of vast proportions. We have seen that this system is the one that works the best, that also gives people the chance to retain their dignity, not to have to flee the countries where they were born, and also not to deprive the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean of such human and professional riches. Accordingly, if we are to celebrate this Europe, let us celebrate it also by remembering the reasons that make us united, that bring us together, and also that allow us to have a better dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Italians, we are obviously particularly sensitive to this issue. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and the Commission for its words, especially its references to the clause and issue of defamation. This is an important report, because the rapporteur has managed to find the right balance between personal freedom, privacy and legal certainty. Often, too often, we see examples of defamation, sometimes truly unwarranted, thanks also to the freedom of information offered by new technologies – the Internet in particular – with what are effectively invasions of people’s privacy. Therefore, I think that the idea of setting up and creating a centre for resolving or acting as a point of reference in disputes is truly a choice that represents both freedom and the rigour that we were all expecting. I also look forward to hearing what the Commission has to tell us about this in the future, also because today, perhaps too many things have been left unresolved. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 The economic crisis – and its consequences in terms of the imposition of austerity measures and budget cutbacks – demographic changes, rapid technological change and the resulting demand for new skills pose serious challenges to, and call for far-reaching reforms in, Europe’s higher education systems, which must not have a detrimental effect on the quality of education. In a knowledge-based society, the future hinges on education, research and innovation. This report marks a step towards implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which states that, by 2020, at least 40% of 30-34 year-olds in Europe should complete higher education or equivalent studies, given the estimate that 35% of all jobs in the EU will require such qualifications.

 I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress achieved by Turkey, especially in underlining the critical issues that are still unresolved. As mentioned in paragraph 11, it is of primary importance that Turkey should have a modern and efficient, fully independent and impartial judicial system, guaranteeing due process of law for all citizens. The growing number of new applications to the European Court of Human Rights shows that the objective has not yet been reached. For the purposes of modernisation, the issue raised in paragraph 29 also seems fundamental. The government must (is called upon to) take all the necessary measures to increase the social inclusion of women and their competitiveness in the labour market, especially through policies aiming to diminish the gender gap specifically in secondary education. It is even more important to mention here that Turkey’s military occupation of the northern part of the island of Cyprus without any legitimate claim has been in place ever since 1974.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this seems like a film from the past. We had thought that by now, piracy was something that only related to the Internet and issues concerning copyright and similar issues, instead of which, piracy is precisely what we know about from books and films of adventure. Obviously, the modern incarnation involves boarding a ship with machine guns and rocket launchers, not scimitars, and quite honestly, my left-wing friends, it has nothing to do with class war. It is irresponsible to claim that pirates exist because of capitalist exploitation. There are no justifications for attacking, stealing and killing – and to say so means to be complicit in such crimes. It is a tragic problem, and it is even more tragic when the people protecting the ships in accordance with international law are arrested by the authorities of other countries duplicitously in clear violation of international law, as was the case recently with the two Italian soldiers in India, or rather in international waters, who were then taken to harbour in India. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the comments made this evening in the Chamber, also because I hope that protecting the law is truly one of the EU’s main priorities. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Berlinguer’s report on the Bologna process. The creation of an open European Higher Education Area has been a major achievement for all of us. Even more important is the need to harmonise the recognition of degrees and the qualification framework, as well as the complete revision of the national systems of quality assurance in university teaching. We still have students today who gain degrees through Erasmus that are subsequently not recognised by their own universities or only allow enrolment in universities that are too different and sometimes even of questionable standing. This is why we need to reinforce the process, in order to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of increased employment and economic recovery, based also on improved cooperation between universities and the world of business and work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not understand why we take so much pleasure in harming ourselves. You have spoken about Morocco as an important partner on a human level, while many of us have already mentioned that Morocco is an imperialist state that occupies land illegally, in which the United Nations has not succeeded in holding a referendum. You have spoken about democratic links with Morocco. Well, in Morocco 22% of the population has the vote, it is one of the countries with the greatest illiteracy levels, farmers and fishermen do not have the right to form trade-unions there and everything is in the hands of the King. You have spoken about convenience for farmers. It is a pity that no European farmers have noticed this convenience, as you are well aware. Explain to me why we are asking our farmers and fishermen to comply with rules that do not apply to those who fish and farm outside of Europe but who are allowed to export their products into Europe. Commissioner, please tell me why democracy is valid for all but sometimes does not seem to apply at home. Marco Scurria,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to renew my best wishes and my compliments to the President for his new position. I wanted to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fisas Ayxela, for doing an excellent job: it is a really comprehensive report which sends out an important signal in the field of sport. The rapporteur has worked well, including with all the shadow rapporteurs, and of course I thank them too for the result. Finally, I also wish to send my greetings to Commissioner Vassiliou. Moreover, it really is a good sign that we are holding this debate and have completed this report in the year when the Olympics will be taking place, the crowning moment for sport worldwide, a time when sport turns into a vehicle for the global exchange of values and friendship. For this reason, we have stressed that sport is a tool for combating discrimination, bearing in mind how difficult it still is, for example, for women to play sports in some countries, such as Iran, which therefore worries us not only because of its decisions on nuclear power. Another significant factor is the idea of supporting the designation of a European capital of sport under the leadership of ACES, the European Capitals of Sport Association. As we have learnt from the European Capitals of Culture, the promotion of activities for the young and old is at its height under such initiatives. The report also includes the fight against doping, a focus on gambling and the rediscovery of traditional games. I think, in short, that we have done a good job in terms of honouring as far as possible the EU’s new competence in sport under the Treaty of Lisbon. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Today I thought that we had changed the order of business, and from the tone and arguments I thought we had decided to talk about President Assad’s Syria rather than a European Member State. I have heard talk about citizens who are afraid to live in Hungary, about a ‘black plague’ knocking on the doors of the EU, about a constitution that is a knife to the throat of minorities, and more. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about Venezuela here. I have seen Mr Orbán, a prime minister, who has come to explain his version to us, and says he will comply with whatever the EU decides. We have to believe him because he has already done so with the law on the mass media. So why all this fuss? Perhaps not because we are really that interested in the institutional and constitutional aspects of the affair, but because we do not share Mr Orbán’s political choices regarding the family, the state and opposing strong powers, and the influence of the banks on political decisions. We must be very careful. We do not have the right to interfere with the internal affairs of the Hungarian people. All we can do is check compliance with the Treaties, and I think this is what Mr Orbán is here to do. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton stated that repression must come to an end in Syria and the phase of transition should begin. However, we are all wondering how this could actually come about: it is true that sanctions have become harsher, although we need to step them up further to make them more effective, but at the same time, the regime does not even listen to the Arab League any more. Therefore what is and what might become our future role? I think that Baroness Ashton’s efforts should, above all, focus on putting huge pressure on the UN, China and Russia, because if President Assad feels he has support in China and Russia, he will not feel isolated. The role these two nations are playing in the United Nations is truly objectionable, as is the funding that the European Union bestowed upon Syria – or rather on President Assad – until a few months ago. Was he not a dictator before now? Has he only just started depriving his country of freedom and democracy? We therefore need to step away from this concept of political correctness, in which anyone who does business with us is automatically considered worthy of financial concessions and a relationship with the European Union.

 In order to tackle youth unemployment in the EU, we need to implement a series of measures such as extending compulsory education to the age of 18 and creating ‘second chance’ schools. These schools would have teachers, psychologists and trainers to allow young people in situations of difficulty, poverty and early failure, also brought about by an excessively rigid existing education system, to be reintegrated into the education system with flexible learning programmes sensitive to their interests and extra-curricular pastimes. In the face of youth unemployment affecting one in five young people, reducing early school leaving by 1% would suffice to produce 500 000 qualified young workers. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, 52% of young people who leave school without qualifications remain unemployed. In order to guarantee Europe, which is in the grip of the economic crisis and rising migration, the concrete possibility of a return to growth and social cohesion, I believe it is crucial to focus on knowledge and suitable levels of education. The reform of the education system must involve partnerships between schools and local enterprises in order to offer students a better careers service. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first and foremost, to thank Ms Paliadeli for the patient work she has carried out in producing the second reading of this provision in collaboration with the other rapporteurs, including my colleague, Ms Sanchez-Schmid. Contrary to what was has been said of late, I am very convinced by this provision – because we can have different ideas and between us we can think things that are clearly different, but if we are here, we are here because we believe in the European Union and we believe in certain values that the Union has established and has seen emerge. These values are the fruits of a common history created by so many individual components in our own nations, in our own cities and in our own lands, but which have then shaped a common civilisation, history, identity and tradition. There is no need to rewrite history to say that Gdańsk was the gateway to the liberty and democracy of a large part of Europe. There is no need to call out the English soldiers who fought in the Second World War, because they were not fighting solely for England’s sake but to bring back liberty and democracy to the whole of Europe. There is no need to recount that this label comes at a price, as with anything of importance. In reality, this is a price which is comparatively small compared to so much of what we support, because by means of this provision, our territory will have factories, houses, libraries, historical centres, castles and places of worship that will remind us, in the diversity of our lands of origin and our nations, that we are children of the same culture, that we are children of the same land which we call Europe, and that, perhaps, if we always return to look at these places, we will find the answers to so many of the problems that trouble our Union today.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is never appropriate to rank crimes in order: they are all, clearly, despicable. However, the crimes we are talking about this evening are especially contemptible. Perhaps it is not by chance that one of the harshest pages of the Gospel is the one where Jesus says: ‘Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.’ Rarely are the words of Christ more damning. Some days, you go home pleased at having done a good job: today is one of those days. Thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, and to the other European institutions, the Commission and the Council, we are launching an important piece of legislation that includes: measures against sex tourism; a clear definition of the crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation, and of child pornography, as well as the aggravating circumstances; a guarantee of as much free psychological help for victims as each case requires; a decision on the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of these crimes; a focus on prevention; and much else besides. Even these days, when anti-politics seems to have the upper hand, politics is able to provide a clear and tangible response, in the first instance for the benefit of the many associations and volunteers who deal with these issues on a daily basis and for the police forces that carry out a highly sensitive and extremely valuable job which, in some countries including my own – Italy – has reached standards of genuine excellence and constitute examples to be followed. Today the important thing was to produce a European strategy to make our citizens feel that the Union is there for them, especially on such crucial issues as these. We can be quite secure and proud in saying that we have succeeded in doing so. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the minute I have to speak, I would certainly like to thank Ms Gardini for the excellent report she has drafted, not least because it comes out of discussions with the competent institutions and the associations working in this area. However, we need more than that. We need a legislative resolution that can go a step further and organise civil protection across Europe with no more gaps and no more overlaps. At a time when the role of the European Union is being debated, this is an area in which there is a demand for more Europe in order to develop united, coordinated action by the whole EU, particularly because civil protection depends on solidarity and volunteering. That fits in nicely with the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon and the current European Year of Volunteering. A financial instrument is needed as well, of course, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing this out and requesting an increased budget. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 The amendment to the Frontex Regulation was a necessity given ever increasing illegal immigration within the borders of the European Union. In this light, setting up teams of European border guards particularly helps a number of Member States to manage huge and sudden migratory flows, such as those that took place following the Arab revolts. At the same time, the procedures for the most vulnerable categories – above all, unaccompanied minors – represent the other side of this measure, where respect for the law and solidarity intersect to guarantee both human rights and the security of the Member States. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Syrian poet, Adonis, has written an open letter to President Assad in which he addresses the President and says that no one believes that democracy can be instituted in Syria immediately after the fall of the current regime; rather, it is unbelievable and unrealistic for Syria to continue the systematic violence to re-establish order. He adds that that is the problem and that it is necessary to lay the foundations of democracy from the outset, now, and not tomorrow. He then says that, on the other hand, without democracy, there will only be a retreat to the abyss. The ‘abyss’ the poet is talking about is growing larger every day in Syria: people filming are being shot, children of even 11 years of age are being imprisoned, some army officials are starting to become discontented and starting to desert. Many would follow them if they could more easily cross the borders with neighbouring states. Even today, the Corriere della Sera
, in analysing the situation in Syria, states that in Syria, the protest is not abating, Assad is not stepping down and the world does not see. Baroness Ashton, Europe is the only institution that can show the world what is actually happening; it is the only institution that can make a real gesture, that can help, but, above all, provide a prospect for the future. It is time to invest in the Mediterranean, thus choosing to envisage a world of peace and stability for the future. It is time for courage and for the European flag, as Adonis told us, to fly in Benghazi as a sign for the whole Mediterranean region. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to vote for this report because it sets out some fundamental elements for cohesion policy and for funding. These are, firstly, leaner procedures for national funds, and, secondly, the provision that sport and culture are also an element of cohesion that is both important and decisive. Perhaps the only negative element of this report is that it envisages only the three working languages of English, French and German as the languages that need to accompany the request in addition to the original language. For this reason, in any case, and for more general reasons I voted in favour and I congratulate the rapporteur. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, to be honest, I did not want to participate in the discussion on the G8, but I did want to put a question to President Barroso regarding culture. In the European Union, there are many programmes to encourage youngsters – and others – to meet, so that this becomes a real Union. For many youngsters and professionals, programmes such as Comenius, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action, etc. have represented the true coming-together of the European Union, inspiring truly European sentiments. (The President interrupted the speaker to explain that the debate was on another subject, but then invited him to continue …)
 I would like to know, therefore, what is to become of these programmes, at least as far as the Commission can tell, seeing that they are approaching their expiry dates and we should already have confronted the matter within the Committee on Culture and Education. How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on? I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), all the rapporteurs who presented reports this morning, as I believe that these reports allow us to lay the foundations for the Europe of the future. This morning, we are working on future generations, from children to our young people, whom we must guide into the world of work by means of the important flagship initiative entitled Youth on the Move. This morning, we are discussing expanding the Union towards the Balkans through culture, as well as developing cultural and creative industries. At a time of great economic crisis, it is important to emphasise that the only sector not making a loss – in fact, its turnover is actually increasing – is the cultural sector. We would like culture to play a part in the external actions of the European Union, and not only, Lord Dartmouth and Mr Kuhn, through well paid officials, but rather by constructing a better process for peace, stability and understanding between different cultures. Today, though, we must also seek to strengthen our programmes for culture, education and young people. For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action,
 and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union’s existence. For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon. We need to invest in all these programmes but, above all, we need to believe in them. Nobody is denying the importance of milk quotas, investment in industry and protecting the environment; but it is culture that will allow us to build Europe, and we will have to do this not with words, but with programmes and actions that we are able and willing to put into practice. Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations. This is how Europe will be built, and at times it may even be necessary to bend those regulations a little. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Baroness Ashton for the report she has put before us today. However, I should like to point out to her that public opinion in Europe is unfortunately not aware of the European Union’s presence. As many of my fellow Members have also mentioned, our external policy is still in a rudimentary state, as can be seen from certain events that have happened in recent days. Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf: it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection. It is our duty to intervene in that part of the world, just as it is in Syria. This country is in a really very serious situation, in which human rights and the chance to oppose a dictatorial government must get the European Union interested … (The President cut off the speaker) Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Speaking a few days ago at a meeting of industrialists, Italy’s Minister for Finance, Mr Tremonti, coined a new phrase – the ‘nuclear debt’. The Member States that have invested in nuclear power are the ones with the highest levels of public debt. How much does it cost to close first- and second-generation power stations? How much do the stress tests, which we are discussing at such length today, cost? Once a power station is shown to be ‘stressed’, how much does it cost to ‘destress’ it? Furthermore, how much does it cost to dispose of radioactive waste? No one has yet told us. As the European Union, we could begin to think of different options to show the Member States. Moreover, given that the Commission will have to provide us with a road map, why not begin to think of real investment in fourth-generation nuclear power – clean nuclear, or fusion – or even begin to consider an overall energy plan? We expect the Commission Communication to outline a road map on this subject and to try to give the European Union a clear direction at last in this sector. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this point of the debate, practically everything has been said, and perhaps that is exactly the point. We continue to talk and, as we speak, the landings are continuing and people are dying at sea and crowding in inhumane conditions on the Italian and Maltese shores, which are not the shores of Italy and Malta, but the border of Europe, gateway to our European Union, through which any of our 27 Member States can be reached. The time for talk is over, we are told by our citizens and the migrants who sought freedom and found themselves locked in closed camps. It is time to act, Commissioner. I call on you; we call on you to take the lead as early as tomorrow, after our vote, and to send a request to the Council for the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and jointly establish a true strategy for the future of the Mediterranean, because at stake is not only Europe’s credibility but also its immediate fate. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure and pride that we are discussing this strategy here this evening: pleasure because Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job, for which I thank her, and pride because it is an initiative that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have very much wanted. It is an excellent report because, of course, it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the Roma, and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach. We like it because it not only sets out rights but also highlights certain needs. We also dealt with it in the opinion that we gave as the Committee on Culture and Education. I am thinking, in particular, about the whole part relating to schooling for Roma children, in which we point out that schooling is both a right and a duty, in which the children’s families must also be involved. I would also point out that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion. Alongside the promotion of Roma culture, it is also important to recognise that the Roma should make an effort to learn about the customs and culture of the peoples with whom they live, so as to facilitate real integration. Perhaps the only thing missing in this report is a reference to Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens. In this regard, we have been waiting for a long time for the Commission to give us an interpretation of how to put it into practice, and we now need to know what it is right and fair to expect the Member States to do. For everything else, I again thank the rapporteur for all that she has succeeded in doing. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking part in the discussion a little shamefacedly, because the Commissioner has more or less told us that it is pointless to conduct this debate because there is nothing to argue about. We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions – in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber – we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission’s views – and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union. Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps – no, definitely – because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place. Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow. More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus. Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens. I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for her work. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis should give us the impetus to find out whether the European Union really wants a foreign policy role. Foreign policy is a serious matter: it needs strategies, firm objectives and clear alliances. We cannot continue travelling around the world patting everyone on the back and pretending that everything is going well all the time. Elections took place in Egypt a few weeks ago and we did not get up in arms because we realised that there was a dictatorship that was fooling all of us. Now that millions of people have taken to the streets, we are all talking about democracy and human rights. This is what we want, and we will try to make sure it happens, but we should be careful about following the crowd. I remember when the Iranian people rose up to get rid of the Shah, and we know how that ended, with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now. I hope, for example, that the Egyptian Government will be able to keep extremists at bay and play a stabilising role in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Baroness Ashton, more democracy is certainly needed in that part of the world, but so is more European policy. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are tackling yet another debate on the violation of human rights and democracy in Iran. This time, it is the case of a lawyer who protects human rights activists in Iran. Indeed, the idea is to solve the problem at source by no longer merely imprisoning people who fight for their rights, but to go directly to those that defend them, just to show which way the wind is blowing for those who wish to oppose the Ahmadinejad regime. I would place a bet today, Mr President, that in a few weeks’ time, we will be back in this Chamber to speak about another different case of all basic rights being violated in Iran. The violation will be disguised by some criminal motive that would be laughable were it not so tragic, such as acting against national security or propaganda against the regime, as in the case we are discussing today. I really do wonder, Mr President, whether Parliament should continue to have a delegation for relations with a regime that is the exact opposite of everything the European Union is founded on. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic, which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli, and which we have turned into this oral question. From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem. There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children. However, these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless. Clearly, these children are our priority. They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires. However, when these children remain in care for too long, they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders. All this is happening whilst, meanwhile, many families would like to open their homes to these children. I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt. However, we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions, as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children, obviously. We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children, because in a few years’ time, these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Vassiliou and thank her for her strong backing for this initiative, just as I should like to thank Mrs Paliadeli and all the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done. Europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulties at present. Indeed, we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty. Obviously, that is an important thing to do, but Europe must not lose sight of the importance of the values that have allowed the Union to emerge victorious from the innumerable challenges it has had to deal with during its history. Europe’s wealth lies in its history, its culture, its art, its leading figures, its landscapes, its symbolic places, its intellectuals, its philosophers and – dare I say it – in its civilisation. This label can represent all of this and highlight all the myriad forms of European identity that the Member States have contributed over time. We must now look at the negotiations with the Council to resolve a few differences of interpretation on several points. I believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily, given the importance of this topic. I also believe that as soon as this report is definitively adopted, we shall all feel more European, due to the values and traditions we share. I believe that through the Commission, the work carried out by Parliament and with the Council, we really are doing a good job for all our citizens. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question from Mr Martin under Rule 149(8)) Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I am very happy to respond to Mr Martin because we know that the bureaucracy issue is sometimes what distinguishes and separates European citizens from their institutions. Seen from this point of view, I think the path set out by this report is quite clear. We shall also talk about it with the Council. Once the Member States have decided which sites the European label could be given to and once we have a panel of true experts coming together, who are given the chance to select the sites within a necessary but not excessive amount of time – and we still need to work out who will have the last word on this, but it is an issue that we shall have to discuss both with the Council and Commission – I do not see excessive bureaucratic issues from this point of view. There are bureaucratic issues for many other measures but not on this one regarding the label, which I think can easily be followed in a secure timeframe and with clear results for all European citizens. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other than the Commission, I should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier. What we are talking about today is important because it is an instrument like ‘Youth in Action’ that creates the spread of ideas, closeness and friendship amongst the countries of the European Union, but also, and above all, amongst those that are not part of it, such as Switzerland or other countries besides. It is the great richness of our multiannual programmes that, through actions such as ‘Youth in Action’, ‘Erasmus’, ‘Erasmus Mundus’, ‘Permanent Education’, ‘Media’, ‘Media Mundus’ and many others, they allow relationships to be built between the countries of the European Union and third countries. Through these programmes, you see, we have brought the European Union to life, allowing many citizens – primarily young people – to meet, swap experiences, come to know others and to become known themselves. We have given teachers and workers in general the chance to improve their professional skills and we have given directors, producers and associations of various countries the chance to do better work. Hence, these programmes are important and so we were a bit concerned when we did not see them on the Commission’s Work Programme for next year. Today, therefore, today we are approving an important step, which makes the EU grow, strengthens citizenship on our continent, and – given that we spoke about it a little while earlier regarding the European Heritage Label – it is a step that contributes to creating this European identity of ours. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, amongst friends one can speak frankly and tell things as they are. Hence, we are telling Morocco that it must do much more to resolve the Western Sahara situation. The European Union cannot continue, and could not continue, to pretend that it is all nothing, because we risk committing a serious error. We risk telling those who have chosen peace, like the Sahrawi people did through the Polisario Front, that they have chosen wrongly. Those who do not send suicide bombers, who do not carry out attacks, and who trust only in international organisations do not make the news. For these people the powers of the world do not come together. Madam President, that is not right, because the Sahrawi are a courageous but mild-mannered people, they live their religion in the right way and their women have important roles in society. The Sahrawi are fighting for their land, for which their love is as infinite as their desert; and they are fighting for their identity, and it is not right that they are left to themselves. The vote we have striven for tomorrow in this part-session is an important sign that the European Union is working to take a decisive role in the destiny of this area of land. Marco Scurria  (PPE

I hope that the actions identified in the Action Plan will be carried forward within the planned timeframe considering their importance for improving the lives of European citizens. In particular, Italy has always supported the need to develop mutual trust between Member States of the Union and is in favour of continuing to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. From this perspective, we strongly support the approach of the whole Action Plan, which hinges on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, to be achieved by strengthening mutual trust. I would also emphasise the need to use all possible means to foster a European judicial culture, particularly through legal teaching and training. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 I take this opportunity to emphasise that a humane society is necessarily based on the principle of justice between the generations, and that age discrimination jeopardises solidarity between the generations, leads to poverty and is forbidden by the founding treaties. Work is more than just paid employment and both young and older people contribute substantially, including through their work in the family, to making our society more humane and improving the stability of services and workplaces. In this report, we call on governments to facilitate and recognise voluntary work that provides care in the community and family care, and to resolve issues of legal responsibility in that regard without delay. I also applaud this report for calling on the Member States to adopt measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members, predominantly women, of all ages in caring for older and younger members, in the context of solidarity between generations. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),  
in writing.

 Italy is the country where enterprises suffer most due to late payment by public authorities, with an average period for payment to suppliers of 180 days as opposed to the European average of 67 days. This leads to financial problems, a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness, particularly for SMEs. The directive we have voted for today discourages debtors from paying late and allows creditors to protect their interests effectively against such lateness, introducing the right to legal interest caused by late payment even when not specified in the contract. It also forces public authorities to pay within a maximum of 60 days from the payment request, provided the service has been performed satisfactorily. The adoption of this directive is truly a great help for our enterprises: nowadays, one company in four closes down as a result of problems of insufficient financial liquidity. These new rules on payments will mean that companies will regain their market competitiveness and no jobs will be lost. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciated the Commissioner’s approach to this discussion, because she stated that there are essentially no real infringements in Europe and also because she reassured us about the Commission’s role as guardian of the treaties and therefore also of press freedom and freedom of expression in Europe. Certain dangers nevertheless still remain. The Commissioner noted that almost half of the countries belonging to the European Union are subject to infringement proceedings to find out whether press freedom and freedom of expression are really guaranteed there. She also highlighted the preventive measures that must be implemented in these areas, emphasising however, that the problem is not specific to one State or to individual States. It is obviously not an Italian problem – Parliament expressed itself on this subject a few months ago by taking a democratic vote – and neither is it a political party problem, because we have just heard that in Germany, it is the socialist group that controls certain media outlets. The problem we must face in this Chamber is more general. Tomorrow, we will vote on a report on journalism and new media – creating a public sphere in Europe. This report contains certain guidelines on which our Parliament is beginning to express its opinion. We must talk about how to combine truth and freedom in the new media, but also in the more traditional media, because while it is one’s right to tell all, it is also one’s duty to tell the truth when writing or expressing oneself through a media outlet. We must also understand how to combine information with the right of citizens – of all citizens – to privacy. These are the issues we must tackle and to which Parliament must confine itself, not ideologies or certain matters concerning things that do not exist in any European country. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who – as announced by President Buzek at the beginning of the session – has tendered his resignation from the European Parliament in order to take up duties in his own country, and to whom I send my regards and my best wishes, because he has done a great job. This report is the result of his intentions, and it was carried in our Committee on Culture and Education by an overwhelming majority, with just a single vote against, for which I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report, both on my behalf and on behalf of Mr Schmitt. Before leaving for Strasbourg, on Monday I went to Rome to visit a private training centre that is achieving superb results, because it has succeeded in placing the vast majority of young people that it trains over the course of time. When I spoke to the director of this centre, he said to me: ‘Please help us, you in Europe too, to follow this course, to add weight to training that moves in this direction, which enables so many young people to find work; help us also to modernise the relationship between universities and business.’ The thrust of this report lies precisely here: today, 20% of young Europeans are out of work, of whom about 30% are graduates; a percentage that is so high that we are forced to ask ourselves very seriously about how we should approach the issue of training young people for entry into the world of work in these times, in this Europe, in this globalised world. We have then, in this report, wished to address directly the issue of how to improve the link between universities and business, highlighting certain key points: first, by giving priority to one of the strong points available to the European Union, namely the ability of its citizens to adapt to the constantly changing circumstances of the labour market; the fact that there is no longer any such thing as a ‘job for life’, and that these days, training and retraining is essential. The first point then is lifelong learning; the second, which, in our view, is of fundamental importance, is that of mobility. These days it is important, as we highlight in this report, to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds, and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and Erasmus for Apprentices, but also the organisation of postgraduate European Masters of Excellence programmes, in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses. Furthermore, more entrepreneurial universities should be encouraged. Such a result can be achieved, for example, through the introduction of a system of knowledge vouchers such as that currently in use in a number of Member States, enabling SMEs, in particular, to improve their research capacity without compromising the independence, autonomy and public character of universities. The third key point is that of research, namely, we see greater researcher mobility – in both the short and long term, across nations and between academia and business – as imperative in enhancing knowledge transfer. Finally, the possibility of extending the good practices in this area that exist in so many countries. I shall conclude, Madam President, by illustrating, in relation to this report and the outstanding work done by the committee, how convinced we are that Europe will not win the battle against China or other developing nations by means of low wages, but by having highly qualified professionals and highly competitive businesses, and in this process, it is of maximum importance that universities and businesses realise how they are interdependent, and that the authorities at all levels contribute to developing more efficient methods of cooperation. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish again to thank the Commission for its communication, which we have adopted for the most part. I should just like to dwell on a perhaps critical aspect that has emerged in this debate, because someone emphasised how fundamental the independence of universities, freedom of research and public financing are. We are all agreed on this, and that is why I fail to understand these critical remarks, because it is enough to read the report, where, in the very first paragraphs, we have written very clearly and stress that the intellectual and financial independence of higher education institutions vis-à-vis business must be maintained and no relations of dependency on business must arise on the part of higher education. It also emphasises that universities should, in all circumstances, maintain the autonomy to decide over their curricula and governance structures. This dispels any problems or doubts whatsoever in this area, which is why I do not understand what these problems could be, unless it is a question of old-fashioned ideological exploitation. Let us accordingly really give some thought to this, since this report sets out the conditions for effectively improving the lot of our young people and our students, because there is truly no one who wants to leave hundreds of thousands of youngsters in the hands of who knows what business purposes but, on the contrary, only wants hundreds of thousands of students to have the opportunity of studying, training and working in the society that awaits them. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to contribute to this debate because we are preparing to vote for what I believe to be an extremely important measure: it is important to rationalise the work of our enterprises, but especially to protect consumers. Those who buy must know what they are buying, and those who seek quality must find quality! However, it is also important to have an idea of the social sustainability of what we are buying. Someone has already said this – but I want to stress it again because I think that this is a specific point that must emerge from this discussion in the European Parliament – I want to know whether a given product is made in a place where workers are protected; I want to know whether that product involves the exploitation of children; I want to know whether that product is the result of unfair competition. So here we have a measure that I hope will soon be extended to other manufacturing and craft sectors, because I believe and conclude that this measure will bring Europe much closer to its citizens, and for this I thank the rapporteurs who have brought this measure into being, and the Commission and Commissioner Tajani for being a driving force behind it. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something because, as was mentioned previously, the Italian Embassy and other embassies were attacked yesterday in Tehran. Because of this, Parliament and the Union should also consider expressing their solidarity, formally if possible, with our country and all the countries involved in this attack. We should also send out clear signals, though, and I therefore officially request that Europe should not be present at the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran and that this should be a clear signal sent by us to the Iranian authorities. I am also saying this on a special day for Italians, because today is the Day of Remembrance. This is the reason I, like many Italians – including you I hope, Mr President – wear this tricolour rosette in memory of the many Italians who were cast out on this day and forced to leave their own lands. Through this act of remembrance, I would like to express our solidarity for those who are struggling for democracy and freedom in Iran. For this reason, I call on our authorities not to go to the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Republic. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in European Union publications and on EU websites, we often say that human rights are the heart of the process of European integration and the key element of its external relations. The countries that have entered into political or trade agreements with the European Union are bound to respect these rights. Baroness Ashton, we ought to ask ourselves whether these requirements still exist in our relations with Iran and whether it really makes sense for us to send a delegation to Tehran without agreeing a programme with the Iranian Government which both sides endorse, one which will allow us to listen to the arguments and voices of the opposition, too. With regard to what we can do, we must, however, be careful even about talking of sanctions, because history shows that economic and trade sanctions have often strengthened regimes instead of weakening them, and that they have, in fact, weakened the people and, above all, the poorest of them. When we listened to certain people as a delegation, and heard testimony regarding the rights of women and minorities in Iran, they told us that perhaps it would be better to impose symbolic sanctions, such as cultural sanctions. In recent days, many representatives and intellectuals throughout Europe have been writing to call for UNESCO not to hold World Philosophy Day in Tehran. I think that this could be a commitment taken on by this Parliament too, remembering that Neda Agha-Soltan was a student with a degree in philosophy, and that this symbol could unite the European Parliament as it calls upon UNESCO to take this action.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to thank Parliament, all the committees, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. We have prepared a report which raises the profile of the voluntary sector. There are 100 million people throughout Europe who work in this field, and each day they selflessly give their time for the good of others and our community. This is the work we have done, increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU-wide activities for the benefit of the associations. I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič and the Swedish Presidency for the excellent work we have accomplished together. I think that this year will mark the beginning of Parliament showing a true interest in this area, which someone called the backbone of our society. Once again, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this important report. Potito Salatto  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not join my Italian colleagues in asking the EU to intervene to protect the two Italian soldiers because I believe that this should instead be the duty of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as it concerns two European citizens of Italian origin. Unless, in this Chamber and our institutions, we do not make the cultural shift that will require the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to take care of our citizens, especially when international rules have been flouted – the most basic of which is that a ship in international waters is subject to the jurisdiction of the flag it is flying – we will never manage to give Parliament a significant role at international level. This would cause serious damage and continue to leave foreign policy to be implemented by individual Member States, rather than creating the supranational state of Europe that citizens are crying out for. I was amazed when Baroness Ashton initially replied to calls for explanations from Italian fellow Members by saying that, ‘We did not receive any requests from the Italian Government’. Moreover, this evening, you, Commissioner, also introduced the issue saying ‘We are acting at the request of the Italians’. This is the wrong cultural and political approach. We are a great nation, a great continent, and we have to take care of our European citizens regardless of their nationality wherever they are, taking action to safeguard them in accordance with international law. I hope that sooner or later, Baroness Ashton will be capable of making this cultural shift. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out quickly to this House that the Bureau gave the green light for the European delegation for relations with Iran to travel to Tehran, subject to a few conditions. May I just point out that only the other day Iran’s Minister for Relations with the European Union officially declared that he did not accept the conditions for the visit, meaning that we cannot take action. I would ask you to revise this stance. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of what has just been said, I and my Italian colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Delegation for relations with Iran are absolutely opposed to this trip to Iran and ask the Bureau, which had decided to give the go-ahead, to re-think this action, which simply gives free publicity to the government in Tehran.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, aside from this issue, I should like to submit a problem to the Presidency. I think some people have not yet fully understood the role of the European Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon. I feel I must point out an underlying problem here: the Commissioner for Transport, Mr Kallas, has repeatedly refused to meet with the board of the Sky and Space Intergroup to discuss the Cost-Effective Small Aircraft (CESAR) project, which affects everyone in terms of the economy, the environment and security. I would urge the Presidency to call Commissioner Kallas to this Chamber to explain the programme he intends to move ahead with in this sector, which is extremely sensitive and important for the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to carry on listing the reasons for our disagreement with the Iranian Government. Since it has not been referred to here, I will only emphasise one of the most serious violations of civil rights, which relates to young people. The Iranian Government, having signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, nonetheless continues to impose capital punishment on minors. After this debate, I would like, firstly, Baroness Ashton, to take on the task of setting out a common approach for Europe as a whole and the European Parliament as a whole on events in Iran and, secondly, the inter-parliamentary delegation for relations with Iran to note that it must change its line. I, together with my friends Mr Scurria and Mr Tatarella, protested to the delegation: in an official statement, it stated that it wanted to visit Iran in any case, even though it had made a peremptory request to have the opportunity to meet and talk to the opposition. From now on, I would like the delegation to start singing from a new hymn sheet and to sustain relations of assistance, support and debate with the exiled representatives of the opposition, not least Mrs Myriam Rajavi, who typifies this situation. This is what the European Union should be doing, rather than imposing sanctions. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, I have held up my card three times now, and you have not given me the floor, whereas you have given it to Mr Schulz. I shall therefore now address my question to the speaker and to all those who have taken the floor, irrespective of their political group: have they enquired as to whether the centre-left governments have ever issued a law that could prevent the concentration of the mass media in the hands of Prime Minister Berlusconi?

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Jazłowiecka’s report, which lets us take an important step forward in the current debate on the economic recovery of individual Member States. While balancing the Member States’ budgets is a priority on the one hand, targeted social investment is also needed to prepare individuals, families and businesses for the change of economic climate and the demands of the employment market. As well as the sustainability of public finances, the Member States should also be focusing on how to create sustainable, quality jobs, on how to invest in training and updating of skills, and on fighting poverty and social exclusion. Hence the need for, and perhaps urgency of, a coordinated approach to social investment and therefore a Social Investment Pact for the whole of Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Mr Becker’s report, which provides a better framework for the contribution of social businesses to solving the current crisis. Social enterprises are unfortunately often seen as a sort of appendage to traditional forms of business, based exclusively on the maximisation of profit. Social enterprises, on the other hand, have a fundamental role to play in the development of markets and the European economy. They enable innovative responses to be made to economic, social and environmental challenges, through sustainable development, social inclusion and territorial cohesion. I therefore support the proposal to set up a Social Entrepreneurship Fund, which meets the primary objective of not exposing these businesses to unregulated competition, guaranteeing them adequate financial support and facilitating their market integration.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at a time when, for some nostalgic nationalists, speaking of closer European integration sounds provocative, we are about to vote on amendments to a regulation which forms the basis for the difficult but necessary process of harmonising and bringing closer together the national legal systems. Allow me therefore to congratulate Mr Zwiefka on the excellent work carried out and his success – after around two years of difficult negotiations – in bringing to a close the process of revising a regulation which has been of fundamental importance to citizens of the Union. Brussels I in fact establishes provisions which are of the utmost importance in ensuring sufficient access to justice and equality of treatment before all the courts which have competence in the European Union. It sets up common standards in civil and commercial matters, clarifying which Court has competence in a cross-border dispute, and making the sentences issued enforceable in the different States. The amendments made to the regulation are required in order to put into practice the wish to create a European area for justice which promotes judicial certainty and predictability of decisions, thus making transnational trade easier and strengthening the single market. That said, I believe that progress towards an ever deeper harmonisation of the standards of substantive law must proceed with the appropriate caution and attention in order to ensure certainty of law and to protect less favoured parties. For this reason, I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur in favour of consumers, who will benefit from the principle of protection for the weaker party. A basic principle under which, in a legal dispute between consumers and businesses, the consumer will always be able to choose a court in the Member State of his or her residence. Similarly, I share the prudent approach taken by Mr Zwiefka regarding the abolition of the exequatur
: while on the one hand abolishing the exequatur
 would allow recognition of sentences to be speeded up at a later stage, on the other I believe that measures for safeguarding defendants’ rights must be maintained. It is therefore necessary for defendants to have the possibility of contesting a decision if their right to a fair trial has been breached and if the decision goes against ordre public
 in the reference State. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my compliments to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. I hope we shall reach broad interinstitutional and political consensus on a regulation which forms the template not only for cooperation in the civil courts but also for political determination based on the process of European integration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very satisfied with the report by Ms Bastos, on which I voted in favour. Unfortunately, the severe economic crisis in Europe has had a negative impact on perceptions of the single market’s potential, among both citizens and businesses, and some governments and national political movements. There is a danger that this will cloud our vision of the excellent work done by the European institutions to revitalise and strengthen the single market, for example the wide-ranging public procurement reform and the revision of the Late Payments Directive. I agree that there is a need, as Ms Bastos has stressed, to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation between the European Union and the Member States. Fundamental measures – such as the setting up of unitary patent protection – are all too often blocked or delayed by institutional conflict and national egotism. In a period of crisis like the current one, we need to take a united approach to governance, one which enables us to introduce the necessary legislation promptly, to revitalise the internal market and strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, almost two decades have passed since the concept of European Citizenship was legally established, but still only 43 % of EU citizens claim familiarity with the term ‘citizen of the European Union’. They lack information and awareness of their rights: language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications are among the most common problems that EU citizens face on a daily basis. I therefore agree with the Commission’s initiative to declare 2013 the Year of European Citizens. I also fully support the rapporteur’s wish to have the scope of application of the Decision widened to focus on enhancing the awareness of citizens in order to allow them to make full use of their rights, and not just their right to move and reside freely. I also hope that the Year of European Citizens will not be another celebratory year but rather provide the foundation for a framework for the future policies, measures and actions needed to reinforce Union citizenship. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, it is clear that if the European Union wishes to emerge from the crisis, it should enhance the competitiveness of its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are responsible for the creation of 85 % of all new jobs in the EU. It is therefore necessary to harmonise national industrial polices to a greater degree, while it is also essential to achieve another objective: internationalisation of SMEs. Only 25 % of SMEs in the European Union have been internationally active within the single market. I therefore agree with the actions proposed by the Commission aimed at encouraging the process of internationalisation and the need expressed by the rapporteur for provision of specific information about priority markets together with details of the various support services available. In conclusion, I would underline the need for greater coordination of the various initiatives at EU level. At a time of rationalisation of public spending, we cannot afford to duplicate efforts or policies, risking the creation of pointless administrative and bureaucratic burdens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg and my fellow Members who, through their excellent work, have helped to bring to life one of the key actions of the Digital Agenda for Europe. The directive we are shortly to approve will help achieve two fundamental goals in the development of European copyright. First of all, it will enable the dissemination and enjoyment of works that otherwise would have risked disappearance from our cultural heritage. This initiative therefore fulfils one of the undisputed cardinal rules of copyright, namely, the protection and promotion of culture and intellectual creations. Secondly, this directive will make it possible to modernise and improve Member States’ legal frameworks by bringing existing legislation into line with technical developments and the need for greater flexibility. This will help boost the economic benefits of copyright by ensuring fair remuneration for work and identifying any rights holders under an absolutely solid regulatory framework. Turning to the use of orphan works for commercial purposes, I support the approach taken by this House, which allows commercial use solely in order to pay for the costs associated with the public service carried out by the various relevant institutions. Indeed, the directive does not address issues relating to profit-seeking utilisation of orphan works, but rather legitimate and cross-border access to such works, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity and depth of Europe’s cultural heritage.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we find ourselves debating the political situation of a country that since 2007 has been an EU Member State, and one that has been meeting its obligations under the acquis communautaire
. Among the legal requirements and political objectives that unite and bind together the Members of the Union, the rule of law is an indispensable prerequisite for the democratic organisation of society. That is why it is so important to debate the current situation in Romania, which is taking on worrying proportions as a result of a power struggle and an unprecedented war between its institutions. In this conflict a majority has tried to take over and dominate all the other bodies, including the Constitutional Court, the judiciary and the other institutions, and bend them to its will, while overstepping and sweeping away the balance between the powers, offices and institutions. It is strange that a certain part of this Parliament that always takes an interest in the level of democracy and freedom in the countries that make up the Union appears indifferent on this occasion or is even trying to justify the situation. I think this House and the Commission would do well to keep a very close eye on what is happening in Romania. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr Turmes’s report, which paves the way for adoption of a directive that will finally make it possible to overcome the differences between Member States with regard to energy efficiency. Though it does not change the non-binding nature of the goal of energy efficiency set by the climate and energy package of 2008, the directive imposes on suppliers and distributors compulsory annual saving schemes in terms of final consumption. According to the Commission’s figures, the measure will bring about a total saving of around EUR 20 billion in the costs of investment in energy generation and distribution. This is vitally important and will help reaffirm the Union as a global player, since the future geopolitical balance will be primarily decided by policies on the supply and use of energy resources.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, whom I thank for the excellent quality of his work and for his valuable suggestions. Despite the ongoing harmonisation of standards of protection and asylum, we still have a long way to go before creating that concept of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Indeed, the Dublin system places disproportionate expectations on those Member States constituting entry points into the EU. I therefore agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur on practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity. On this latter issue, I think it is absolutely necessary to make the best use of the complementarities between the different EU funds available, in order to translate solidarity into concrete action, including financial incentives for relocating beneficiaries of international protection.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Comi for her work and for the excellent quality of her report. Standardisation is one of the twelve levers to boost the internal market and will play a key role in helping to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Indeed, the new regulation will enable European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity and safety for their products and services more quickly, using a technically updated, flexible and effective system. This will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, enabling them to reduce production costs and administrative burdens, and raising their profiles in the single European market. That said, we will need to continue encouraging voluntary consultations between industry, public authorities and other stakeholders, so as to ensure that the development of standards and regulations is transparent and can be updated over time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate the Danish Presidency on its excellent work and on the significant results achieved in the context of the European Semester. In particular, I offer my congratulations on its excellent negotiating skills which helped, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, to end the vulgar and absurd diatribe concerning the location of the European patent court. As rapporteur, I agreed, with regret, to postpone the final vote following the Council’s unilateral proposal to amend the proposal for a regulation, but I must point out that this way of operating is unacceptable. It seriously undermines the constitutional balance of the EU, especially in an area and a measure that are fundamental to boosting economic growth in the European Union in key sectors such as innovation. This is a measure in which Parliament took a programmatic, constructive approach. I would therefore like to express my deep bitterness over what happened and call on the Council of Ministers, represented by the Cypriot Presidency that has now taken over, to find a solution with regard to the substance and the procedure as soon as possible. It will not be Parliament that causes a project that we have been working towards for over 30 years to fail, nor shall this Parliament allow the rules governing interinstitutional relations to be unilaterally modified by any institution. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, company law can act as a lever for developing the internal market. In difficult times like these, we now need to work together to find acceptable solutions that can be implemented rapidly. I shall therefore be very clear, Commissioner, as to what this Parliament expects in the coming months; you have already noted certain requirements in your speech. First of all, we hope for a pragmatic and flexible approach to make the legislation clearer and more accessible. To that end, even though a single instrument would offer significant benefits, the directives could alternatively be grouped by sector: for example, by the principles of function, mobility and forms of law. The other priority is to place European company law at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that over 90% of European businesses are SMEs, the internal market needs to be the natural environment for them to operate in, not merely a potential option. Lately, Parliament has been waiting, with some impatience, for a legislative proposal to set out the measures to facilitate companies’ cross-border mobility. That is all I shall say, because this subject is so huge that it is hard to cover it all in just over a minute. Nevertheless, I believe that there will be no shortage of opportunities for useful discussions. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report which, at the end of the European Year of Volunteering, concretely sets out its objectives and strategies. I fully agree with the aim of increasing the importance of volunteering and promoting cross-border regulation at EU level. Cross-border volunteering is an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth, contributing to the development of an economically and ecologically sustainable social conscience. To this end, I consider three initiatives proposed in the report to be key: the establishment of a centralised portal on volunteering, the creation of a European Humanitarian Aid Corps and the development of a European Skills Passport. I hope, finally, that there will continue to be a strong common will to invest in an area of such importance that promotes the development of common values and helps the integration process.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully supported the report by Mr Kalfin, whom I thank for the excellent quality of the work he has done, and agreed with the report’s contents. The Internet is a critical infrastructure. Online attacks can cause serious consequences and safety risks for both businesses and private households. For this reason, I agree on the urgency, highlighted in the report, to develop a reactive, flexible framework to prevent cyber attacks. Since virtuality does not have boundaries, it will be necessary to improve international cooperation and regulations in order to make future strategies effective. In this respect, the European External Action Service (EEAS) can and must play a key role in starting a constructive dialogue with third countries, including, where possible, issues regarding Internet security in the scope of its external relations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported the report by Ms Herczog, who correctly detects the need for a coherent approach to improve regulatory convergence with neighbouring countries. The fact that Europe is a major purchaser of energy on global markets can, in fact, be seen as a weakness. On the other hand, the fact that we are also the biggest importer could be one of our strengths, if only the EU countries were to take a common negotiating position with third countries. I therefore support the approach proposed by our colleague, in particular, with regard to the three objectives underlying the whole strategy; namely, improvement and coordination at EU level, especially in strategic sectors such as research and innovation, the need for increased diversification of energy sources and, finally, the development of sustainable common policies on a global scale.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Ms Borsellino’s report, which addresses the need for a cross-party, multidisciplinary approach to security. I especially agree with her emphasis on establishing the key areas of the strategy, including the fight against terrorism and organised crime. I do not, however, believe it appropriate to adopt measures to protect intellectual property rights, in that this matter is already the subject of in-depth ongoing debate. That said, it will be essential to enhance EU judicial and police cooperation through Europol and Eurojust, via a proper implementation of the strategy. At the same time, proper and consistent legal instruments will need to be developed to facilitate the investigative process and the use of evidence. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, I welcome Mr de Jong’s report, which seeks to clarify the extension of the new European area of freedom, security and justice in criminal matters. The discussions under way in the Council are proceeding steadily, with two opposing positions: those who warmly welcome developments and those who are cautious about the emergence of an EU criminal law. The operational proposals that Parliament has advanced in response to the Council’s views are on the right track, namely, towards a careful examination of the need for, and the consequences of, adopting EU-wide legislation in this sector. I therefore fully support the request for additional resources to strengthen Parliament’s Legal Service to enable the proposals to be evaluated systematically and in depth. At the same time, in my view, it is essential to promote greater coordination between the institutions on this matter, in order to ensure that future initiatives are based on broad consensus and on Member States’ criminal justice policy requirements.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the priorities and the points Mr Busuttil has stressed in his report. I hope this House will adopt the report by an overwhelming majority so as to further enhance the operation of the single market, which is an absolutely vital part of the policies for EU development. That would send out a strong signal to the individual Member States. The latest results from the internal market scoreboard have shown how Member States are increasingly failing to deliver on the transposition of European legislation. That is why I agree with my fellow Member that we need to increase the power and flexibility of infringement proceedings, while rethinking the role SOLVIT should play as an alternative to seeking legal redress. In that respect, I share his reservations about the danger that we might run into problems with the principle of subsidiarity if the legal basis for SOLVIT is over-formalised. I therefore think the Commission needs to examine all kinds of solutions very carefully so as to make the portal more operational without running the risk of getting bogged down in legal technicalities. Lastly, we must bear in mind the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has redefined Parliament’s role considerably by giving it substantial powers to structure and review EU legislation. In that regard, the conclusions of the scoreboard need to be properly examined within this Parliament’s regular dialogue with the national parliaments, with a view to a more fruitful collaboration with the national authorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Ms Wikström on her work, the excellent quality of the report she has produced, and the compromises she has reached. The purpose of this report is to plug what is, unfortunately, a serious and glaring gap in Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 (Rome II), which emerged due to the lack of an agreement on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. This has arisen, in particular, due to the considerable impact of accessibility via the Internet to content that is published and distributed on a massive scale on blogs and social networks. It is therefore a necessary step to facilitate access to justice, ensure the internal market functions properly and deliver an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the right to privacy. I therefore fully endorse the urgency in adapting Rome II highlighted by the report, and I am particularly pleased with the proposal to create a centre for the voluntary settlement of cross-border disputes arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. Considering the high costs of judicial settlement, an alternative voluntary dispute settlement system, which would, of course, be less costly, could meet two needs. It could protect individual rights and personal image, while at the same time ensuring freedom of opinion. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated Ms Hübner’s report, which offers a useful way to stop essential resources for countries in crisis being decommitted. This is a regulation of fundamental importance which, without making any changes to the European Union’s budget, will provide an alternative to the risk of losing funds already assigned under the cohesion policy to Member States involved in a financial assistance programme that have problems with cofinancing. I especially agree with the precise definition of the instrument’s ceiling and the policy decision to favour projects that have generated revenues and those that could contribute to achieving the Member State’s strategic goals in order to improve its chances of economic recovery. I believe that this measure will contribute to balancing the need for investment in development and growth with the excessively-revered austerity solution to the sovereign debt problem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the agreement addressing the need to strengthen transatlantic cooperation in fighting terrorism after the 11 September attacks. I do not share the intransigent position taken by the rapporteur who, despite the positive opinion of the Commission Legal Service and of the Data Protection Working Party, has continued to assert that the agreement was unnecessary and disproportionate. I am aware of the limits of this agreement and of the room for improvement; nonetheless I believe that its requirements in terms of data protection have greatly improved. The agreement obliges the US authorities to share their data analysis with the judicial authorities of the European Union, explaining in detail its permitted use, namely the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. I therefore believe that it would be unnecessary and detrimental to start new negotiations, at the risk of a rejection of the agreement which might deprive Europe of any law in this field.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this report, through which Parliament is trying to send out an important message on simplifying and harmonising corporate taxation. The existence of 27 different legislations on corporate income tax does not only mean high costs and red tape for businesses operating in different countries, but also the serious risk of tax evasion and tax discrimination. This intervention is essential to reduce the costs for businesses operating in several states and to promote economic growth and economic recovery within the internal market. Finally, the optional nature of this measure, which gives companies the possibility to assess the benefits and costs when choosing the new system, neutralises the reluctance of some Member States that fear their sovereignty in taxation and revenue may be at risk. In the interests of citizens and businesses rather than solely on the basis of calculations of national self-interest, I therefore hope that the Council will be able to reach an agreement without resorting to enhanced cooperation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Berlinguer, whom I congratulate on the work and the excellent analysis he carried out. The report fully highlights the problems and shortcomings that are obstructing the effective development of the European Higher Education Area. In particular, I am referring to the inadequate relationship between universities and the world of work, to the still unfinished revision of the national systems of quality assurance and to unfair access to university educational systems. Therefore, I share my fellow Member’s calls for the adoption of a common system of quality assurance in order to establish mutual recognition of university qualifications. At the same time, I hope that the next ministerial conference, scheduled to take place in April, will address the sore point of the issue: the need and urgency to move quickly in the process of revising the directives on professional qualifications and their recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are almost 450 000 international successions opened each year in the European Union, for a total value, as has already been said, of over EUR 120 billion. Nonetheless, there are still numerous difficulties for citizens to face to establish which State, and which authorities shall have jurisdiction in matters of succession. To that we should add that most Member States do not allow the citizen to choose the jurisdiction applicable at the time of succession. There are also numerous questions arising regarding the judicial recognition of official notarial acts in a Member State other than the one where they were drawn up. These serious shortcomings, these tangible needs on the part of European citizens, are addressed by the regulation which we are about to adopt, and in doing so, ladies and gentlemen, we are not approving a classic piece of legislation, but rather we are creating an instrument to regulate a crucial aspect of institutional organisation within every society: indeed, the concepts of inheritance and succession as well as the rules governing its effects and individual details have huge repercussions for the organisation of any society. For that reason, I would like to sincerely thank everyone who contributed to this challenging project and in particular Mr Lechner for his work and for his efforts during the difficult legislative process that is now coming to its conclusion. I thank him first and foremost on behalf of those millions of European citizens who will benefit from a tool that fully meets their needs and makes a substantial contribution to the process of European integration. Thank you. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, I should like to ask Mr Tajani a question. I shall take the liberty, Commissioner, of returning to an issue already addressed a few months ago, during an identical Question Time, and that is the transposition and implementation procedure for the Late Payment Directive. Your reply at the time maintained that you had written to all the Member States and were waiting for the relevant confirmations. My questions are as follows: what stage have we reached? Have you received replies? Do you have information on individual countries and, most important, can you point out those countries that are in good order and those by contrast that are still taking their time?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo on the work he has done, which recognises the key role played by the defence of intellectual property rights as an indispensable instrument for economic growth in the European Union, in that it creates jobs and protects cultural diversity. Infringements of intellectual property rights effectively do enormous damage to Union revenues and it is essential to strengthen our efforts to combat unlawful acts through collaboration between national authorities, European Union institutions and industry experts. The adoption of this measure answers this need and enables us to lay the foundation for creating a single market for intellectual property rights. Embedding the Observatory within the European Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will in fact ensure that it has the human, financial and logistical resources it needs in order to carry out its task in an effective manner. We are at the start of a long journey, during which we shall have to monitor and evaluate the Observatory’s activities with close and careful attention. Infringement of intellectual property rights in fact occurs on many levels, requiring different degrees of protection and recognition by Member States. It will be essential to continue to make use of the expertise of national authorities and the many specific representative organisations. This will enable us to strengthen the technical skills of the Observatory, thereby simultaneously ensuring that every intellectual property right is recognised at the EU level without any hierarchical ordering of the level of protection and recognition. Raffaele Baldassarre,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Lechner on the excellent work he has done, which clears the way for a measure that specifically meets the needs of business, particularly of small businesses, and contributes to the process of completing the internal market. The interconnection of national companies registers is of fundamental assistance to firms wishing to open a branch in another Member State or simply do business with enterprises in other states. As well as increasing consumer and user confidence in cross-border transactions, this interconnection will result in saving businesses a potential EUR 69 billion of costs every year. What is more, this measure will increase legal certainty, which will help to solve one of the problems businesses face most often in their cross-border activities. Notwithstanding that the interconnection is of a purely technical nature, and will not therefore also extend to the legal consequences arising from the use of registers, the transparency and the reliability of the information that this will be able to provide and guarantee form the basis on which consumers and information users can exercise and defend their rights. In conclusion, I should point out that a special feature of this measure is that questions of a technical nature cannot be answered exhaustively. In other words, problems and the relevant solutions will arise and have to be developed in the course of the creation of the network. For this reason, the interconnection process will succeed only if, as I hope, the Commission and the Member States work together closely. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of this directive, which implements measures needed to protect the lives and freedoms of the victims of crime. To give an example: according to some estimates, there are about 100 000 women in Europe who benefit from protection orders. Such measures, however, are currently limited in their effect to the territory where they were adopted or in which the victims live. As a result, there is a legislative gap that this directive fills through the mutual recognition of protection orders in the context of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The instrument to be introduced shortly will, in fact, ensure that a protection order issued in one country will automatically be recognised in any Member State that the victim visits. This is an extremely important result, which, in practical terms, helps to create a European Union area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for in the Treaty. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted for Ms Mathieu’s report since I strongly believe that immigration in Europe is a great opportunity, but that it must be managed intelligently and fairly. Without effective intervention, the labour market would be divided and a host of low-cost workers would threaten to undermine the achievements of the European social model. I therefore think this provision will help to prevent and control such a threat by creating a level playing field for the citizens of our countries and for third-country nationals; I am referring, for example, to access to the various kinds of advisory services that the host country makes available. Similarly, I am pleased with the compromises reached on access to education and training and on the portability and transferability of pensions and acquired pension rights, which will no longer depend on whether or not there are bilateral agreements between countries.

 Madam President, I am delighted at the adoption of Mr Lehne’s report, which at last provides for the exemption of micro-enterprises from pointless and often incomprehensible accounting obligations. That will enable each and every one of them to save an average of EUR 1 000 a year and cut their overheads by 25%. It is, in fact, superfluous and disproportionate to subject micro-enterprises that trade only locally or, at most, regionally to the same financial reporting requirements as large companies. Unfortunately, because of a blocking minority comprising a few Member States, the Council wants another two years to approve this measure. I sincerely hope that the Council will stop taking this attitude and we will not always need a crisis to occur for good proposals to be put into effect, when it comes to making life easier for small enterprises, which are a major engine for growth in Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though all EU Member States should respect people’s right to a fair trial, national procedures on information in criminal proceedings vary considerably from one country to another. Some Member States provide for accused persons to receive only oral information about their procedural rights, while others provide information – especially if it is technical – only in writing or at the request of the accused. Since over 8 million criminal proceedings are brought in the European Union every year, it is easy to see that an information system that is still so varied and heterogeneous is inadequate. I therefore agree with the content and aims of this directive. I am referring especially to the general rule making it compulsory to provide accused persons with information about their procedural rights before proceedings begin, particularly the right to be assisted by a lawyer and to be able to benefit from official translations if the proceedings are in a different language. With regard to the stage after proceedings have begun, I agree with the two specific rights selected: the right of accused people to full information about the charges brought against them, and their right to access to the case file. These are two essential conditions for determining and challenging the lawfulness of the arrest or detention and for enabling them to put up the best possible defence. I therefore congratulate the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on their work during the informal trialogues. These have led to the approval of measures that will harmonise the spread and development of fundamental rights, such as the right to a defence and the right to a fair trial.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of promoting a European identity and improving knowledge of our shared history – especially among young people – is of crucial importance, especially at a historical and political juncture like the present. To work towards achieving this goal I voted in favour of the report by Ms Paliadeli, in which I completely agree on the criteria for identifying the sites, which I think should take place transnationally and on a two-yearly basis, thereby boosting the quality of the process. Lastly, I fully agree with the role given to Parliament, which will be duly involved in the process of selecting the chosen sites. For one thing, Parliament has always supported the development of this label, firstly in the 2007 tourism resolution and then in the 2008 resolution on the European agenda for culture in a globalised world.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the complexity of the process of recognition, which affects an extremely high number of professions, is an obstacle to the circulation of European professionals and has negative effects on growth and competition. Therefore, I share Ms McClarkin’s view which aims to streamline administrative processes by creating registration systems and an online portal containing all the relevant information regarding procedures. I believe that the proposal to extend the Internal Market Information system to professions not yet open to the directive on services is valid and necessary. Finally, I hope for further development of the debate towards other and wider categories of professionals. I refer, in particular, to professions close to the world of business, which currently raises an often unnecessary barrier against cross-border exchanges, as in the case of legal and accounting professions. o o o Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Simon’s report since I fully agree with the urgency to bring more clarity and directness to the application of rules on State aid to services of general economic interest. In particular, I believe that there is widespread agreement on the urgency to draw up de minimis
 measures for services of general interest which do not substantially affect commerce between Member States. Having said this, I have some reservations on the approach chosen by the Commission. In fact, I believe that the excessive quantity of texts, between communications, decision and regulation, runs the risk of confusing the normative framework and of making it appear confused and difficult to understand rather than contributing to a genuine and functional updating of existing rules as required.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over 80 million people in Europe are threatened by poverty. The economic crisis has aggravated this situation, leaving the weakest fringes of society exposed. I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Daerden’s report; I particularly appreciated its comprehensiveness and the number of issues raised, making for an effective fight against poverty. I refer specifically to the close examination of cooperation between states, to the definition of common principles to establish the so-called ‘basket’ of goods and services that are essential and accessible to all, and to the fight against child poverty. In the same way, I agree with the lines of action drawn up by the Commission, in particular, the priority of better use of Structural Funds, which could play an essential role in the development of innovative approaches and of specific programmes in the fight against poverty.

 Madam President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, in the field of innovation, European small and medium-sized enterprises are still suffering from slower growth than their counterparts in the United States and in other emerging economies. In this context, unitary patent protection can provide an excellent opportunity to boost the role of SMEs in the area of innovation and research, and contribute to the relaunch of the internal market at the same time. Therefore, I would like to ask whether you intend to propose, in the medium or short term, specific measures to facilitate the access of SMEs to the European patent market – for example, a European fund with the responsibility and power to pay registration fees on behalf of SMEs – and whether you believe that the legislative procedure under way can help and offers a good opportunity to attain this objective.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) in civil, commercial and family matters is a valid alternative to the traditional confrontational approach between parties, offering an effective, inexpensive solution to disputes. I therefore support Ms Wallis’s horizontal approach, which extends the benefits of ADR to business-to-business civil and commercial transactions and to family disputes. That said, I hope that the Commission’s forthcoming legislative proposal will satisfy the key points highlighted by this Parliament: above all, the need to ensure a high level of impartiality and transparency of the systems, the application of ADR to electronic commerce by means of an online multilingual platform, and the promotion of ADR as a valid, cost-effective alternative to forms of collective redress.

 Mr President, public procurement can play a decisive role for the EU budget: indeed, public expenditure on works, goods and services accounts for roughly 17% of EU GDP and almost a fifth of this expenditure – approximately EUR 420 billion – falls within the scope of the EU directives on public procurement. I would therefore congratulate Ms Rühle for setting out what I believe to be the red lines of the forthcoming reform of the directive on public procurement: in particular, I am referring to the criterion of lowest price, which can no longer be the determining one for the award of contracts and should be replaced by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender in terms of economic, social and environmental benefits. Similarly, I agree entirely with the urgent need to simplify the rules in order to make procurement procedures simpler, less cumbersome and more in line with the needs of SMEs and small contracting authorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis has shown that the Stability and Growth Pact is not working as it should. Six Member States, three of which are in the euro area, are having budgetary problems and risk defaulting on their debt. This is a situation that we must urgently put an end to. It is important, however, that this be done in a way that is sustainable and with a view to the future. That is why I voted in favour of the Goulard report, whose approach of using sanctions I approve of, particularly with respect to manipulation of financial data, falsified statistics or misleading information on the part of a Member State. At the same time, however, future efforts must be directed at what is the heart of the problem, namely the insufficient degree of economic integration within the European Union. Sanctions will have a merely cursory dissuasive effect if we do not reinforce the bonds forged by single economic policies by increasing the number of surveillance missions by the Commission, and in the medium term, the use of Eurobonds. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having regular access to up-to-date and reliable budgetary data is the key to regulating public spending and enabling the swift adoption of corrective measures in times of crisis. I therefore agree on the need to allow the Commission to monitor, with the help of a fiscal body, individual Member States’ compliance with budgetary rules. Having said that, I must point out that, under the Treaty, the establishment of a medium-term financial framework leaves the way clear for newly elected governments to amend the programming decisions that were previously taken. This directive must therefore be applied to the letter, and the Commission must constantly monitor its application. This is to ensure that intervention has a tangible rather than superficial effect and that it helps to achieve the directive’s primary objective: uniform compliance with budgetary discipline as stipulated by the Treaty.

Essentially, Mr Juncker, a number of economists are accusing us, together with European leaders and European institutions, of wasting precious time in saving the euro. We have reached a crossroads for Europe and for our currency. In this light, what can we expect from the meeting of the Eurogroup Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 3 October? Do you believe that a solution is possible? If so, which solution and with what kind of political support? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union continues to move forward at too slow a pace in the area of science, and is not catching up with the United States and Japan, who are the leaders in this field. On average the 27 Member States invest 2% of GDP in research and development, rather than respecting the 3% target set by the Commission. As a result the publication of the Green Paper by the European Commission seems even more opportune, as it enables us to actively revive the discussion, as described by the excellent report by Ms Matias. I second the request made by the rapporteur concerning the establishment of an all-European common fund to promote collaborative research in the European Union and reduce inequality among Member States. At the same time I believe it is essential that any measure is preceded by a doubling of the research and innovation programme budget for the financing period from 2014. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the successful implementation of Directive 2008/52/EC shows that mediation is a viable alternative to the traditional adversarial approach, in that it allows for the amicable settlement of disputes and thus reduces the workload of the courts. This is confirmed by the various initiatives taken by some Member States, which are encouraging, where possible, the use of mediation through financial incentives or legislative provisions. In view of that, I should like to draw attention to certain aspects that I believe deserve further thought and consideration, starting with the issue of costs: we should follow the example of Member States that have tackled this problem by providing financial incentives to use mediation. I also believe that we need to explore other possibilities, such as the use of awareness campaigns to promote the use and understanding of alternative forms of dispute resolution, especially on the part of businesses. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary also, and above all, to involve members of the legal system, who must see the added value of mediation as something that enhances, rather than competes with, their work. Lastly, looking ahead to the forthcoming Commission communication on the implementation of the directive and, in particular, to the imminent legislative proposal on alternative dispute resolution, I should like to emphasise the way in which mediation complements other reforms of EU law, in particular, the approach to forms of collective redress and to contract law. Indeed, as a preliminary measure, mediation can be an excellent alternative to forms of collective redress and can make an important contribution to the future instrument on contract law, significantly reducing the use of dispute resolution mechanisms.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work, which offers some interesting points of departure for increasing the quality and effectiveness of European legislative activity. I shall restrict myself to highlighting a number of aspects which I think are especially significant: it is absolutely essential to achieve a 25% cut in red tape, which can only be achieved through greater collaboration between the Commission and the Member States on measures designed to avoid diverging interpretations and the resulting ‘gold-plating’ of transposed legislation. With the same objective in mind, we need to ensure high quality correlation tables between directives and national transposition measures and we need to carry out retrospective assessments of the legislation implemented on a more frequent basis. These are essential measures for ensuring that EU legislation achieves its primary goal, which is meeting the expectations of EU citizens, the businesses operating on the single market, and national and local governments.

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, a little less than a year ago, Parliament adopted the new directive to combat late payments. This was a vital recast which, by imposing firm deadlines on payments made by public administrations, satisfies the requests made by businesses and citizens and amounts to a formidable counter-cyclical measure that will also combat unemployment, which is laying waste to our countries. I would point out in this regard that one in four businesses fail due to late payments by public administrations, with the resulting loss of many jobs. Member States must transpose this new legislation not later than 16 March 2013. I would therefore like to ask Mr Tajani what measures the Commission is taking to ensure proper transposition of the directive into the various national legal systems and to facilitate the early entry into force of the directive, as promised by a number of Member States? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her work and the contents of her report, with which I am in complete agreement. I believe that only an optional instrument to be adopted by means of a regulation can adequately fulfil the objectives of the whole reform of European contract law. Moreover, an optional instrument should neither harmonise nor replace national contract laws but rather work alongside them as an alternative instrument that offers freedom of choice to contracting parties. Therefore, I do not agree with the proposals put forward by those who would prefer to limit the scope of this instrument so that it applies only to e-commerce contracts, as this would create an artificial and, above all, unnecessary distinction between online and face to face transactions. Our task as legislators is not to limit the legal nature of the regulation on the basis of speculation or market projections but rather to ensure legal certainty and to lay the foundations for a common legal language in the field of commerce. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 One necessary component of effective enforcement of judgments is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor’s assets and to freeze them. Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market. That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system, by which I mean an additional, autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts. This preventive measure will also provide a further deterrent against payment delays and will force the disclosure of assets in cross-border claims. Raffaele Baldassare,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Single Market Act lies in its desire to satisfy the needs of the market, facilitating access and participation of all those involved: businesses, consumers and workers. Given this ambitious goal, I am satisfied with the interventions proposed by Mr Barnier and the indications provided by this Parliament. In my opinion, some priorities are imperative for achieving the objectives that the EU has proposed, in particular: improving the access of small and medium-sized enterprises in the domestic market, reducing their administrative obligations and facilitating their participation in contract bidding procedures, removing all obstacles to the development of electronic commerce, and supporting and financing innovation, particularly through the issuance of bonds for European Union projects, especially in energy, transport and telecommunications. Finally, only by connecting development and support for the business world with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy regarding employment can we achieve what I believe to be the aim of this act, namely, to create a social market economy based on growth, competitiveness and sustainability.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your speech and the list of measures announced, and will not enter into the legal and regulatory debate on temporary protection of migrants and the application of Article 80 of the Treaty. As we speak, unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast, their passengers often paying with their lives. Despite the recent transfers, Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria. Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people, while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations. Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow, but we cannot continue to go it alone. We need the European Union, we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration, starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Schwab on the work he has done so far and the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Providing for varying degrees of harmonisation of standards will allow us to achieve important results, which will provide real added value for European citizens. Significant among these are the fourteen-day right of withdrawal and the new rules on information requirements, not only on price but also on the identity and address of the seller. These improvements will increase consumer confidence, especially in cross-border shopping by providing the legal certainties essential for the development of e
-commerce. This directive will also lay the foundation for other complementary measures, from the reform of European contract law to the process of reviewing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This fundamental harmonisation action is an essential condition for the development of an internal market focused on the rights of its consumers and serving the citizens of the European Union. About a year ago, Professor Monti said in his report to President Barroso: ‘Consumers and consumer welfare should be at the centre of the next stage of the single market’. First, the law-maker should reach early agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, to ensure a high level of protection in an integrated retail market. This provision fully meets the demands, and I am convinced that Mr Schwab will maintain the necessary determination in the complex negotiations that will follow before the final adoption of the text.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report and I should like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Járóka for the work she has done. She managed to bring together the different positions and establish clear objectives and priorities for the strategy; namely, the provision of specific measures against nomadic lifestyles, guarantees on basic healthcare, equal access to primary, secondary and higher education, and the right to housing. The strategy actually aims at inclusion and not merely integration. It is obvious that the role of the Commission and local authorities will be crucial, above all, in terms of controlling and managing European Union funds. The only limitation of this report is the lack of instruments to check the actual desire for integration amongst some Roma communities and the consequences that are likely to stem from any unwillingness to remain on the territory of a Member State or participate in the treatments, and the aid and welfare programmes, which certainly cannot continue ad infinitum
 without producing results. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although some excellent results have been achieved so far on the road towards European integration, there remain some gaps in fundamental areas for the development of a democratic system and full confirmation of the rule of law. Despite the progress made with the amendments to the legislation on criminal procedures and other primary laws, some aspects are still substantially behind schedule. I refer, in particular, to the urgent need to ensure the responsibility and efficiency of the judiciary, as well as its transparency, not to mention that of the public prosecutor’s office, and their independence from political interference. To that end, substantial changes are needed to the system for appointing judges and public prosecutors, putting an end to the practice whereby their appointments only take place in parliament and within the government. Lastly, (...) to improve access to justice and to free legal assistance. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 The market in services represents two thirds of the gross domestic product and two thirds of jobs in the European Union, but even so, only a fifth of total intra-EU trade. All the same, I can only agree with the priorities enumerated by the rapporteur and, in particular, as regards the completion of the points of single contact and the strengthening of administrative cooperation. As things stand, the first generation of points of single contact exists in 22 Member States. This would appear to afford us some comfort, were it not for the fact that in only 14 of them is it possible to complete the process online. On the contrary, it is essential that points of single contact become an integral part of greater e-government in the EU, making the offering available in different languages. Finally, it is essential to strengthen administrative cooperation so that the whole of this communication-based system can function efficiently. The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has already become a vitally important tool. It supports the work done by administrations, enables different administrative methods to be coordinated and deficient information to be supplemented. In spite of this, monitoring will, in future, be necessary to make sure that this system is not only used but also, and above all, correctly applied. Raffaele Baldassarre,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with exceptional speed and dynamism, this Parliament is about to consent to the first instance of enhanced cooperation that specifically concerns the internal market. The accepted justification for this is that the discussion on a European patent has been on the agenda for many years. We should therefore do well to specify that the draft regulation on the translation regime was not adopted by the Commission until 30 June 2010 and that the Council took note of the lack of unanimity and the difficulty of reaching a unanimous decision in the near future in November 2010. I shall gloss over, then, the pace at which we in Parliament have dealt with the dossier, which I hope will serve as an example for the future, because we have broken records of some significance in favour of a speedy and efficient legislative passage. Nevertheless, since it is not my intention to act solely as a spokesman for the interests of my country, which is currently opposed to enhanced cooperation, and since I believe that the subject of the patent is fundamental to the development of industry and the European entrepreneurial system, I should like merely to raise certain questions that I consider to be important for the exercise by this House of its legislative functions and for the future treatment of regulations on the patent. First and foremost, we should do well to recognise that a vote in favour of enhanced cooperation will systematically legitimise the application to the development of the internal market of an instrument that should instead have the quality of a last resort. We are therefore creating a precedent that could be used in all areas of the internal market. Furthermore, I believe that this Parliament can, when we are faced with other subjects, subsequently state its view in a manner that is exhaustive and autonomous, and that individual proposals are at the centre of users’ and businesses’ interests rather than those of individual groups of countries.

 Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am pleased to have had a Presidency that has proved able to manage the European agenda in a pragmatic and effective way, albeit at a difficult time. From the adoption at first reading of the recast of the directive on combating late payment in public administration, which is fundamental to the future of the system of undertakings, to the adoption of the financial supervision package, the Belgian Presidency has proved to be both practical and dynamic. I could cite other examples, but I prefer to draw conclusions about what can be learnt from a Presidency that has concluded its term of office in a positive way. Firstly, one has to have a realistic work programme; secondly, one has to be able to negotiate dynamically and reach compromises; and, lastly, one has to fully involve the European institutions, starting with Parliament, and take an approach to outstanding issues that is free from constraints and national interests. I hope that this Presidency will serve as an example to the others that follow it. For now though, I offer it my most sincere congratulations. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend for my speech to deny the seriousness of a situation that is the inevitable outcome of obvious administrative and political failings, which have been – and still are – in danger of burying an entire city and its surroundings in waste. Mr Søndergaard and Mrs Lichtenberger, the crisis in Campania initially began and then developed so dramatically because of the inability of a regional council and a left-wing Naples city council, together with aldermen from the Greens, to take decisions – including unpopular and brave decisions – to create an environmentally friendly waste collection and disposal system. Irresponsibility, indecision, political gain, sinister collusion and waste characterised a political and administrative phase that is now definitively over. I want to reassure those who tabled the oral questions and the political groups that supported them that the political situation is viable and has completely changed. The national government and the new regional council have shouldered their responsibilities and have the political determination to resolve the crisis. Through a dialogue with the populations concerned and with the necessary resolve, they are overcoming obstacles and objections that are often caused by Nimby Syndrome, or the idea that people do not want others’ rubbish in their backyard. As a result, they have drawn up an integrated waste collection and disposal plan that will shortly provide incentives for separate collection and the construction of the necessary facilities. It would therefore be extremely unfair, counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting: imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union, which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs. This contradiction reveals some people’s genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested. The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union. The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption. On the one hand, this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature. However, on the other hand, the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes. The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and, naturally, the political approach is changing. The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union. This is the basis of today’s debate and the oral question submitted, which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament, and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown. Allow me to recall Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who said: ‘All grown-ups were children once – although few of them remember it’. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating a European identity and increasing citizens’ interest in the European Union and its origins are two challenges that the European institutions must face up to in order to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity. Furthermore, these challenges are at the heart of the goals of the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, Article 3 of the Treaty establishes the EU’s obligation to safeguard European cultural development. If the European dream is going through a difficult phase at the moment, this is not only down to the impasse
 regarding Europe as a political project, or the ongoing economic crisis, but is also due to the difficulties faced by a Union founded on an as yet unresolved identity. In this situation, it is more necessary than ever to reduce the gap between the European Union and its citizens, bringing the multinational yet shared cultural heritage of the European Union to its citizens and, above all, to future generations. This is the meaning and importance of a European Heritage Label: to bring Europe together in its diversity, promoting a shared culture and favouring integration between the places involved within its territory. In order to realise this objective, the new label will focus on the symbolic educational value rather than on the aesthetic beauty of a site, favouring cooperation between sites and supporting joint projects amongst them. I should therefore like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mrs Paliadeli and the rest of the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular, with regard to the procedure for selecting the sites and strengthening the role of the European Parliament during the selection process. I am sure that the Member States’ decision to insert the label within the framework of the European Union will contribute to increasing its visibility and prestige, so as to realise the objectives of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on Mr Szájer’s report tomorrow, we will give the go-ahead for one of the new instruments – on implementing acts – contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. This will simplify the old comitology system. It is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts, regulating methods of control by Member States over the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission. The fundamental importance of the Regulation has made the legislative procedure complicated both at inter-institutional level and within Parliament where, however, because of the involvement – albeit belated – of all committees, I hope it will be possible to adopt the proposal at first reading. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for succeeding in achieving the priority objectives for the European Parliament: I refer to the guarantees to align the current comitology procedures with the new procedure, the right to scrutiny by Parliament and the Council, the creation of an appeal committee chaired by the Commission and the inclusion of a review clause that will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the procedure. Allow me a final comment on what was the last obstacle to the negotiations: the inclusion of the common commercial policy within the scope of the future Regulation. Although the final agreement will allow the application of a simple majority voting system for the adoption of anti-dumping measures during a transitional period of 18 months, subsequently the measures will be adopted by qualified majority. This solution was the outcome of a difficult compromise but I am convinced that it satisfies both the needs of industry and the European Union executive, removing decisions of a technical nature from the risk of dangerous politicisation.

 Mr President, after the adoption of the Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service, we are today called on to make that decision operational by amending the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations of Union officials. In that respect, I would like to focus on an aspect of the report that has involved us in difficult negotiations: the issue of geographical balance in the composition of the European diplomatic corps. Some Members would, in fact, have preferred different criteria for the selection of staff, based on country of origin and citizenship. Such proposals have been avoided by means of balanced compromise amendments, which have been able to take geographical and gender balance into account without imposing country-based selection criteria. The selection of country-based quotas would not, in fact, have been a suitable or desirable solution. After over 50 years of European integration, the Union’s first real diplomatic corps is now being created. It has to be put in a position to be able to develop a common foreign policy and serve the Union’s interests on the international stage. For it to accomplish this task, it is crucial that its staff represent the Union and not the Member States of which they are citizens or have been diplomatic officers. That is the line that the Committee on Legal Affairs took yesterday when adopting the Rapkay report, and that is the line that I hope will continue to be taken in the vote in plenary. Raffaele Baldassarre,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, Mrs Weiler, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased and proud to have contributed to the adoption of this directive on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is a vital counter-cyclical measure which provides very real support to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by laying down definite payment terms and appropriate penalties to encourage punctual payment by both public authorities and private enterprise in the European Union. If everyone involved paid their debts on time, the European economy would receive a cash injection worth EUR 300 billion. Our market will not be common and our competition will not be fair until uniform rules are established that apply to everybody. That is the motivation behind the new directive on combating late payment: it forces public authorities to be more efficient and virtuous in their actions and helps the internal market and free competition to develop homogeneously, to the benefit of SMEs. This House has been able to make a decisive contribution to this successful outcome by overcoming all kinds of pressure and divisions for the sake of the general good of the people and of the European production system.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg’s report highlights a fundamental question for the EU integration process: the need to make simple, clear laws that EU citizens can understand. I cannot fail to agree with the key objectives identified by the rapporteur, in particular respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the importance accorded to the impact assessments and to reducing administrative burdens. With regard to the impact assessments, I am keen to stress that the Committee on Legal Affairs is actively working so that the European Commission can develop mechanisms to provide guarantees and ensure the independence of the analyses carried out. This is a fundamental question: ensuring higher standards for the impartiality of the assessments would give the EU’s legislative proposals greater credibility, and would simplify the process for their adoption. Furthermore, I consider it vital to work towards a clear reduction of the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation. The European Commission would like to reduce these burdens by 25% by 2012, which would entail an increase in the level of EU GDP of 1.4%, equivalent to EUR 150 billion. A substantial part of EU administrative burdens stems, in fact, from the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of administrative procedures implemented at national level. To give an example: 72 EU legislative acts have imposed 486 information obligations, which have led to the adoption in the Member States of more than 10 000 implementing acts. While on the one hand, increased monitoring is required during the transposition of Union law, on the other, greater collaboration by the Council and the individual Member States is essential. To conclude, I think that, leaving aside matters concerning the principle of subsidiarity, closer cooperation with national parliaments can provide a decisive contribution towards making EU laws more effective and ultimately bringing them closer in line with the needs of EU citizens. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new guidelines to promote employment constitute a fundamental step towards economic recovery and growth in Europe. The meltdown has triggered a significant rise in the unemployment rate. In 2010, this figure reached 9.6%, and 20.3% for youth unemployment; in other words, millions and millions of people are unemployed. Yet unemployment is only part of the problem. Indeed, the task is not simply to create new jobs but to improve and preserve the ones that already exist. To achieve the goals set out in the report, we also need a structural change in the economy. In this respect, despite the considerable efforts expended by the rapporteur, Mr Őry, Parliament’s response to the statistics I have just mentioned remains general and unfocused, and this is to the detriment of the European strategy. Indicators and key targets are not enough. It is not enough to use terms such as ‘coordinate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘collaborate’. A pact between generations is not enough. We need a European policy that meets the needs of its citizens. The limits imposed by budget policies must be overturned by more specific, development-oriented public planning. We must direct the actions we take today towards helping young people and future generations; we need training and education policies that allow for investment in human capital in order to improve its quality and to connect it to the labour market. We need to make choices that will help the production system. To sum up: we need less paperwork, more investment and clearer economic choices. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Interconnecting business registers is an essential prerequisite for promoting integration of the economic area within the EU and for improving legal certainty for businesses and consumers. Mr Lechner’s report picks out very clearly what are the priority measures that are indispensable for making the law more certain and for making cross-border economic transactions more transparent. Firstly, it is vital that interconnecting registers and access to data take place in a single framework. To this end, it will be necessary to strengthen and develop the potential offered by the BRITE interconnection project in order that a single portal can be established through which all our citizens can obtain information on European businesses. Secondly, it will be vital that it is adopted with a view to making integration of business registers compulsory for all Member States, so that all states take part as soon as possible. This is because the success of any project that aims to achieve a harmonious development of the internal market requires the participation of all interested parties so that it can be made compulsory as soon as the technical standards have been fully developed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Albania is a fundamental factor in the stability of the Western Balkans and in the EU enlargement process. The country is taking important steps to develop democracy, improve infrastructures and transition to an open and competitive economy. However, Albania’s path to the European Union is still blocked by the difficult stabilisation of the party system, due, in part, to the obstructive behaviour of the opposition, which has a negative impact on the development and approval of structural reforms. The economy is still being held back by an uncertain legal framework, widespread illegality, a large informal economy and inadequate energy and transport systems. Italy has played, and still plays, an important role in the stabilisation of Albania: Italy is its main trade partner, main investor and main benefactor – 430 000 Albanians live in Italy. However, these forms of collaboration need to be supported by European action, with cooperation on a macro-regional basis, such as Adriatic-Ionian cooperation, to help pave the way for Europe in the Mediterranean.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has confronted us with the evidence that greater coordination at European level is an absolute priority for the development and stability of the financial markets. That said, I shall limit myself here to highlighting one fundamental issue, particularly in the light of the difficult trialogues still ongoing. If giving financial oversight authorities the power to adopt individual, directly binding decisions – as provided for in Article 10 of the regulations – responds to the political desire to react quickly to emergency situations, then in the case of daily supervision, this power conflicts with Articles 17 and 258 of the treaty, which state that it is the exclusive power of the Commission to ensure the application of the law of the Union. Furthermore, in this case, a paradoxical situation would be created in which the Member States, present in the highest body through their own authorities, would be indirectly responsible for applying the law of the Union. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I proposed a compromise amendment which attempts to resolve this discrepancy between the powers conferred on the authorities and the role and competences of the Commission, in full compliance with the treaty. I hope that the contribution of the Legal Affairs Committee can be used as a basis for any further compromises with the other European institutions in order to arrive swiftly at a much needed solution, which is completely in accordance with the law of the Union. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers in the scope of the directive. This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules. By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules. Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition. Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost. It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks. In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers’ health and safety.

 The proposal for a draft Framework Decision establishes fundamental obligations based on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court case law. The right to interpretation and translation is essential for those who must defend themselves in a criminal trial and cannot speak the language of the proceeding. Moreover, under Article 6 of the Treaty, the Union respects the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which upholds the right to a fair trial. The text we are discussing today is a satisfactory and fully acceptable compromise. In the compromise solutions, the Presidency in fact safeguarded the essential points indicated by Member States with regard to costs arising from implementation of the directive and the transposition period. In the light of all this, I am pleased by the results achieved within the Council and European Parliament: interpretation must be offered in the mother tongue of the suspect or in a language known to the suspect, while translation will be offered only for the essential documents and the possibility of drawing up oral summaries of the main documents will be considered.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the creation of the Union and the holding of the summit of Heads of State or Government, we still lack a clear definition of EU Mediterranean policy and a long-term strategic vision for the development and stabilisation of the region. Yet the Mediterranean has enormous potential: one third of global maritime traffic now passes through Mediterranean waters, coming from China, Asia, European countries, India, reaching our waters via the Suez Canal. The coastal countries of the Middle East and of Africa are advanced developing countries and for us, they are vital in certain fundamental areas, including that of migration flows. We must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean, providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects. The key points include agriculture, transport, maritime highways, transnational corridors, renewable energy and the Solar Plan. In the words of Paul Morand, a French diplomat and writer, the Mediterranean is, above all, the anti-desert civilisation. Let us reassert these words. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last two years have left millions of unemployed people in their wake, have been the cause of further national debt that will remain for many years still, and have put renewed pressure on and new tears in our social cohesion. We must react in a timely and incisive manner, and, in order to avoid making the errors of judgment that the Lisbon Strategy succumbed to, Europe 2020 must be extremely realistic in its objectives and balanced in the goals it sets itself. Three of these seem to me, Commissioner, to be priorities. The first is certainly a stable currency and stable national budgets, which, however, must not be divorced from development and economic growth. We need investment in research and innovation to make our industries ever more competitive and our products of the highest quality. We must support SMEs and new industries, such as IT and sustainable energy and, of course, our infrastructure. Let us raise the overall level of education, yes, but chiefly we must mould training to the needs of the labour market and production. It is a paradox that businesses are still demanding specialisms that the market is in no position to offer. It is clear that every target should be related to the national context, but within the framework of a broader European strategy. I shall conclude by saying that the Greek crisis and the economic and employment crisis in the whole of Europe testify to the fact that in order to safeguard social cohesion, development and stable national budgets, we need strong and solid economic governance at the European level, to enable European institutions, including Parliament, to take effective and preventive action.

– Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Szájer for the outstanding work delivered in so little time. The delegated acts will be of paramount importance for Union law and the interinstitutional balance in the EU. Therefore, it is fundamental that they are developed and decided upon in a fully transparent manner which effectively enables the Parliament and the Council to democratically control the exercise of the power delegated to the Commission. To this extent, as advocated by the Szájer report, some issues will be of utmost importance and require our stronger commitment. These include, inter alia, the possibility for the European Parliament to revoke the delegation at any time and to make sure that Parliament and Council are conferred the same rights concerning their involvement in the process of delegation. Finally, I would like to stress that it should be a priority for the Commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis
 to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291, including the acquis
 in policy areas which, pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty, are now subject to the codecision procedure. Raffaele Baldassarre,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, needle-stick and other sharp injuries are among the most common risks faced by healthcare workers in Europe, and they therefore represent a serious problem both for the healthcare sector and for society in general. The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers’ Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions. The main aim of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or pointed objects used in medicine. This agreement therefore represents an important step towards an increase in safety within the hospital sector. As we all agree, the consequences of sharp injuries can be extremely serious and can cause the spread of diseases such as viral hepatitis and AIDS. That being said, I must stress the need for an integrated and, at the same time, realistic approach to this problem. In this respect I believe that the administrative, financial and legal constraints deriving from the agreement should not be excessive and therefore should not be such as to harm the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the healthcare sector, or else these enterprises could have serious difficulties in complying with the terms of the agreement. Just as commendable, moreover, is the anticipated – to ‘anticipated’ I would add ‘desirable’ – option for the Member States to adopt more effective provisions and measures than those contained in the agreement with the aim of protecting workers. Lastly, I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament, which often focuses on this issue, so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the microfinance facility for employment is part of a set of initiatives that have been adopted at European level, and it gives the unemployed an opportunity for a new start and opens the door to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including, of course, the young. The new facility should extend the range of targeted financial support to new entrepreneurs in the current context of a reduced credit supply. Individual entrepreneurs and founders of micro-enterprises will also be assisted by way of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building, in addition to interest-rate support from the European Social Fund. It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis. Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment. It is, however, necessary that the transfer of Progress funds remains unchanged, in the sense that we cannot give the signal to divert resources from the Progress programme. These resources need to be found from other sources and, above all, need to be associated with other European initiatives, so that we project a strong image and make a strong effort in favour of the unemployed in Europe.

The Treaty of Lisbon substantially changes the institutional balances that were originally outlined by the Treaty of Maastricht concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by including, though with substantial exceptions, the ordinary legislative procedure relating to the area of freedom, security and justice. It is therefore necessary for any amendment to the measures implementing the Europol decision to be adopted within the new legislative framework envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Europol cannot be strengthened unless Parliament is able to express itself properly on regulations relating to measures that are not purely technical but political, such as the transfer of personal data. Allow me to add a thought concerning the European Union’s increasingly outward-looking stance and the increased synergy between internal security and defence. Even if the treaty has no immediate effect on the development of security and defence markets, it paves the way for the development of a more integrated and consistent security market, which requires legislative actions that are coordinated and therefore interinstitutional. It would therefore be all the more inconsistent, if not indeed harmful, to adopt ‘political’ amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision that do not follow the legislative procedure envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both proposals fully transfer to the Commission the powers which, until now, have been held by the Council. With the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the consequent abolition of the pillar-based Community structure, the legal situation will be profoundly different and significantly modified. Therefore, the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent allocation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars. This is why I feel it is essential that the proposal provides for greater involvement of the Member States – I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that the involvement of experts is sufficient – and, above all, true involvement, true participation of the European Parliament within the coordinating group of the mechanism to monitor and verify the proper application of the Schengen acquis
. Furthermore, in my opinion, we should determine and better define, by means of more comprehensive, more precise criteria, how to use the migratory pressure parameter, which pinpoints the areas of greatest risk where unannounced visits should take place. Lastly, the proposals should be treated as a single package and not separately, since they both represent common aspects of the same issue and have the same shortcomings. This is also because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the applicable procedure will be codecision. I therefore fully support the position set out by Mr Coelho and the calls on the Commission to withdraw these proposals and submit other, better ones, which take into account what has come out of this debate.

‘Finning’, or the removal the fins of sharks on board vessels, with the remaining parts of the animal’s body being thrown into the sea, has been banned in the EU since 2003. In order to put an end to this practice, it should be made mandatory for sharks to be landed with their fins still naturally attached to their body. Many fishing boats in the Mediterranean Sea practice finning since the sought-after shortfin mako and blue shark are both common, although these species might soon be listed as threatened with extinction. Illegal fishing is on the rise in the Mediterranean, in part due to the high demand for shark fins and the prices that they command. This type of non-sustainable fishing causes serious damage to the marine ecosystem, especially in recent years in the Mediterranean, where there is evidence that a number of shark populations have been affected by the practice. Greater cooperation is required in order to combat this illegal practice on board fishing vessels. To this end, the Member States must step up controls both at sea and in port, preventing the bodies of sharks from being thrown into the sea. Finning must be made transparent, controlled and above all regulated, so that it can be considered a sustainable and non-invasive form of fishing. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Enlargement represents the future of the European Union in order to ensure cohesion and integration. The recent financial crisis has highlighted the interdependence of national economies, both within and beyond the EU. It is therefore important to consolidate relations, especially in the economic area, with candidate and potential candidate countries. It is essential to create a climate of harmony and conciliation between different nations and peoples, encouraging economic cultural and religious dialogue. The peaceful resolution of conflicts and the establishment of good neighbourly relations between European countries are essential to sustainable peace and stability and contribute substantially to a genuine European integration process. It is important to give adequate priority within enlargement policy to the building of an efficient, independent and impartial judicial system, effectively fighting corruption, money laundering and organised crime. Enlargement must remain a credible policy, based on democracy, human rights and reconciliation. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the ‘better law-making’ initiative we discussed back in September served as a basis for this second sympathetic report from the rapporteur. The Treaty of Lisbon has undoubtedly given Parliament additional powers at an important time for European integration. Nevertheless, law-making, in concrete terms, remains out of kilter with citizens’ expectations. All this clearly requires careful monitoring and increased cooperation, based on the confidence demonstrated by European institutions in individual Member States to guarantee the uniform and homogeneous application of EU law in all 27 Member States. Law-making must be clearly informed by clarity, transparency and coherence, with respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, but at the same time it needs to challenge the fact that some Member States are somewhat unwilling to support this integration process, which is particularly significant from a legislative perspective. We therefore need workable tools that facilitate the transposition process and allow further judicial cooperation, on the assumption that the infringement procedure is the symptom of a pathology that must be cured by force. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that better legislation is an ongoing goal both of Parliament and of the institutional bodies that contribute, through colegislative powers, to giving a sufficiently clear and orderly framework for the more than 500 million EU citizens that expect clear, accessible and consistent laws. Indeed, consistency is not just a political issue but must translate in real life into legislation that meets this fundamental requirement. It is important to highlight that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, this requirement is best met by close cooperation with national parliaments. We need appropriate criteria for assessing the correct application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and, above all, we need the will to work out whether eight weeks are enough time for Member States to give the opinion it is their right to express. Institutional websites providing information for citizens are helpful, but we also need greater engagement from local bodies and regional levels of government. Lastly, evidence-based policy making may be combined with impact assessments on the legislative process to measure its effectiveness. All of this contributes to building a properly simplified framework to avoid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing more costs than they do already and ensures that the gap between Brussels and Strasbourg, and between Member States and citizens, is reduced. A Europe of citizens with the EU institutions genuinely at their service is what Parliament must aim to make into a reality. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, the four reports that have been adopted today clearly demonstrate Parliament’s desire to make a decisive contribution to supporting the fisheries sector, which is currently beset by major difficulties. I voted in favour because I feel there is a vital need for coordinated action, just as I also believe that an approach involving regionalisation is absolutely essential in order to tailor this action to the needs of individual areas. We need to trim down the industry, expand market opportunities, enable fleets to modernise and ensure that there is real modernisation and growth in the sector, in which environmental sustainability must go hand in hand with economic profitability. We await the framework regulation and finally the implementing dossier on the funding for the further acceleration that we think is needed. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this dossier because I believe that the issue of energy efficiency, together with sustainability and competitiveness, can certainly be an essential instrument in a particularly difficult process, such as this one. We need sustainable growth that has to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and that can be used as a virtuous cycle, including through innovative green technology. All this must be achieved through a culture of design that makes the best use of these resources, channelling them towards building refurbishment, which, in particular, requires the full and appropriate use of EU cohesion funds. One third of buildings in Europe were built after 1973, which is clearly significant. It is possible to act within this context, including by means of better training and design that is consistent with the aims of the provision. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report because I consider financing infrastructure projects in the field of transport and energy to be of crucial importance in achieving the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as laid down by Europe 2020. As highlighted many times by the Commission and by Parliament, developing the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), trans-European energy network (TEN-E) and telecommunication infrastructures is part of the overall and necessary framework to relaunch EU employment and investment. Therefore, adequate support for financial resources guarantees the project will go ahead, and so acts as a catalyst for private investors, for whom uncertain risk perceptions and the ceaseless advance of the global economic crisis block the flow of finance. The construction of new modern and integrated infrastructures is fundamental if Europe is to remain a competitive, central player on the world stage and a leader in the post-crisis international economy. Building new infrastructures will create an enabling environment for a striving and competitive European private sector, stimulating growth, creating jobs for young people and engaging future generations in the relaunch of our economy, thus addressing some of the most pressing challenges our continent is facing today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for and have supported this measure, because I think it is in line with the overall strategy to develop a sector that is still really struggling and is affected by huge market volatility, environmental challenges and the need to ensure environmental safety. I would say that the limit on aid to individual farmers is right, that the incentives for greening to help these new processes develop and inject competitiveness into the sector are good, and that so is the support for young people. This is an important, meaningful programme that also affects small entrepreneurs. What we really need is development. Simplified, leaner procedures that ensure direct payment are vital, to ensure that a sector that finds itself in great difficulty has a chance for real development. That is why I voted in favour and why I have supported an intervention that also allows for direct payments to young farmers to give them a chance and an opportunity to take the initiative and develop their business, which could bring significant results in terms of employment that the European Union cannot ignore.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure also falls within a wider context of a joint strategic framework on agriculture. It is an important intervention that ties in with the others also adopted in today’s sitting. We have, however, observed – including in light of the information provided by Mr De Castro – that the Council’s stance on opposing delegated acts constitutes an unwarranted removal of Parliament’s competences and powers. Inter-institutional dialogue would, instead, force the Council to take a more flexible stance. Simplification on EU funds and the possible use of the Structural Funds are important issues, as are the preservation of ecosystems, better organisation of the agri-food sector, improved attractiveness of farmers for investment and better development of skills tied to the results achieved.

Mr President, Commissioner, the new Cyprus Presidency – we wish you success in your work – ladies and gentlemen, what we have heard today has made it very clear that there is a vast gulf between the position of the Council, which considers the Schengen issue we are discussing today simply to be a legal issue, and, on the other hand, the clear and coherent position of the Commission, which suggests quickly returning to the codecision procedure. The Council deprived us of our say on 6 and 7 June and we are relying on the Council recalling its sense of joint responsibility in this particular case. Schengen is a product of civilisation, a real and, we would say, inalienable achievement: 40 000 km of land borders, almost 800 km of maritime borders, 25 countries involved and 400 million citizens. Citing the supposed problem of public safety is not enough to call into question something that remains an extremely valuable achievement. Schengen, like the single market, is among the few accomplishments of the European Union which we can now say is responsible for there being even partial European citizenship. What is needed is more cooperation, more cooperation in policing and judicial terms, responsibility and solidarity. Parliament wants an open and integrated Europe, where everyone fully plays their part and that is another challenge that we want to achieve with the decisive contribution of the Commission and with a Council that restores solidarity in its relations with Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that a report on the evolution of macro-regional strategies is extremely important because the frame of reference is certainly not just Africa, but all the continents that look out over this crucial area. It is an area that needs resources, infrastructure, partnership and cooperation, through an integration policy that must be developed further in light of what has happened in the area bordering on southern Europe – the so-called Arab Spring, with all the undeniably genuine freedom movements that have not always led to what we would have wished. Lasting stability is still required, however, and could be achieved through a partnership aimed more at young people. Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes with a Euro-Mediterranean focus will provide those areas with a further opportunity for growth and enable many young people to develop work there. Salvatore Iacolino,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at such a complicated time of spending rationalisation, restraints and restructuring of expenditure, defining a reasonable balanced budget, as our rapporteur Mr La Via has done, is a clear sign of how we can do well even in a context of great difficulty. That said, as the LIBE Committee, we take note of the information that, once received from the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), was then tangibly transposed into positive assessments. I am referring to Frontex, as well as to the question of the Refugee Fund. However, when it comes to the safety of citizens, we believe that in 2013, the bridge year for the next financial perspective, something more tangible needs to be done. I refer, in particular, to that list of political priorities which, Madam President, leaves no reasonable doubt as to the efficacy of the fight against organised crime. In this area, more can probably be done, and we are confident that the same indication can later be drawn up by the Committee on Budgets. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this document, as well as the other document with which it forms the ‘two-pack’, because I believe that they could be important in creating both stability and growth. However, these alone are not enough. In any case, we believe that at a time of serious crisis such as that which the European Union is facing, Parliament should take on an even more courageous role than it has so far, and we believe that development, employment and the labour market go hand in hand with a mechanism for surveillance of the budgetary policy of each Member State, because discipline is extremely important. The European debt redemption fund could prove to be a useful tool, as could the annual coordinated public debt issuance framework. The European Investment Bank has a greater role in order to achieve budgetary, political and fiscal union, which are the essential objectives for growth and development, the need for which we are fully feeling and noticing at the moment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of European company law will undoubtedly determine the future of the European Union itself. One need think only of the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a sector that has gradually grown stronger but that now, more than ever, needs structural reform. The single European market will surely profit from the perspectives of a European company law with a vision. Clearly, this vision must be imparted by the Commission, and it seems to me that the Commissioner’s comments are heading in this direction. We need an action plan with clear, accessible rules, where reducing red tape is given a high profile, and where company law is there to serve SMEs and business in general. At the same time, we also need to look at other important issues, in particular, data protection, which must be updated and continually monitored and which could add to the burden on business. We need action for SMEs, extra safeguards for businesses to guarantee their rights, and cross-border mobility for companies, which must also be guaranteed and supported through an overarching approach aimed at meeting the requirements of company law, SMEs, healthy enterprise and, indeed, the employment market. We therefore trust that Mr Barnier’s proposals will bring company law in step with the times. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that this appointment is an extremely important event or that the European Union should look after the weak and the vulnerable if it wishes to be even more real, authoritative and charismatic. There can be no doubt that choosing a Special Representative for Human Rights is an extremely valuable thing to do. My congratulations of course go to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on the outstanding work he has done. Solidarity, accountability and cooperation: the Member States that put these qualities into practice need to be consistently supported, and we also need to impose conditions favouring those third countries that show particular interest in, and pay attention to, the protection of fundamental rights. That is with regard to trade relations. On the subject of immigration, we still have a number of unresolved issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights for people who flee their native countries because they can see their interests and needs being trampled on there. We need to treat these people with great respect as well. It is a question of natural rights, rights that are inherent to the individual and closely linked to the growth of his or her personality. The European Union must therefore ensure that this role is fulfilled as effectively as possible. The person who is chosen must have two qualities: charisma and courage, and must believe wholeheartedly in the job he or she is appointed to do. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at this time of great difficulty, with such an overwhelming financial and economic crisis, the Commissioner might feel there are other policy priorities to debate and discuss. Because otherwise, the issue of multilingualism, the issue of cultural wealth, the issue of democratic participation should already have been effectively resolved, but they have not. The European Union undoubtedly has union at a monetary level, while it does not yet at a fiscal or political level, and there is no doubt that the denial of rights of citizenship includes denial of the right to participation and information. What should consultation be for, if not to provide a procedure, a tool to help citizens understand what is happening and, through the occasional heated exchange of ideas, through proper debate, to come up with concrete proposals for the decisions that will then be taken by the European institutions? Standing between the goal and the procedures that have been identified, there is probably a strong political will on the part of the Commission. Yet there are a number of innovative opportunities, including websites, there are a number of tangible opportunities that could ensure that the cultural wealth – which should be encouraged – has a tangible opportunity for growth. Otherwise, there will not be much point in further extending the boundaries of the European Union, and it will not be possible to guarantee the social cohesion that is created through an open challenge towards the territory. It is true, we must combine the instrument of political consultations with the effectiveness of parliamentary activities in the best possible way, and we still need to make optimum use of resources in a context where they need to be used rationally. Nevertheless, Madam President, if Parliament really wishes to be the home for all EU citizens, much more needs to be done and we call upon the Commission to make a great effort in this direction. Salvatore Iacolino,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, I take note of the speeches by Mr Gerbrandy, whom I congratulate, and the Commissioner. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I can only welcome the inclusion in the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of many of the suggestions made in our report from the Committee on International Trade. There is no doubt that, in the context of the EU’s external dimension, trade in environmental goods and services is an instrument of particular significance for economic and social development. In particular, the opening up of the markets to highly energy-efficient goods and services plays a role in Europe’s conscientious growth in terms of exports, the creation of new jobs related to the spread of new green technologies, and innovation and competitiveness for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In our opinion, we have reaffirmed the importance of some essential elements in future European bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements: the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services; the inclusion of a section on sustainability; the inclusion of tariff preferences for environmental goods and services produced within the Generalised System of Preferences; not to mention the simplification of procedures. The European Union must maintain its global leadership in protecting the environment and promoting, through trade, the use of green goods, services and technologies in third countries for truly sustainable global growth. We must, Commissioner, particularly in relation to third countries, encourage the conclusion of trade agreements consistent with the proposed energy efficiency measures, thus ensuring deliberate, smart growth within the European Union.

OECD data on youth unemployment in the EU, which stands at around 22%, contrast with the provisions of Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out a number of actions at European level regarding young people, their education, employment and vocational training. Initiatives for growth, in this sense, are fundamental factors in the coordinated and harmonious development of the EU single market. Intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth are three main objectives for developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation and, at the same time, fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. These objectives are pursuable only through effective and efficient use of EU funds, in particular, the Structural Funds, of which EUR 82 billion remains unspent, much of which could be aimed at young people, in particular through small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby contributing to the creation of employment opportunities. I am therefore in favour of a future policy providing opportunities for young people by identifying further and more ambitious funding sources to help them to cope with high youth unemployment. I also consider it essential to allocate significant resources when drawing up the 2014-2020 financial framework, focusing on young people who are not in employment, education or training. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union’s internal security strategies are undoubtedly a fundamental reference point for protecting citizens. It is equally clear, however, that if this section is not allocated sufficient resources to enable these important objectives to be enacted, then security will remain – as it has thus far – a possible but somewhat indefinite option. Recent events show that security must be guaranteed not only through significant resource allocations but also through strong cooperation based on trust between Member States. The fight against organised crime and terrorism requires strong solidarity between Member States, safeguards for the licit economy, and robust law enforcement against all transnational threats. This demands a prevention-based approach, including border protection and effective enforcement measures to combat organised crime, mafias and terrorism. It is a challenge which, together, we can win. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, I have supported the de Jong report because it takes account, above all, of a valuable principle: that of the specific character and history of each nation and thus the substantive criminal law of each Member State. It is also concerned with protecting fundamental rights, respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and – in a European Union intent on dealing a real and fatal blow to organised crime, terrorism and corruption – allowing the judicial rulings issued by one Member State to be recognised in the others. In addition, it talks about the goal of harmonisation, with all the premises stated thus far, the definition of offences common to Member States and those guarantees for accused persons, especially under cross-examination, that may become the symbol of a common criminal law in the EU. Salvatore Iacolino,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction plays a crucial role in respect of a priority which should perhaps be supported more strongly and incisively by the European Parliament, and that is the battle against drugs and drug addiction, at a time when addiction is not limited to drugs and psychotropic substances, because there are other addictions that should and could be better tackled through a list of actions that the European Union should support. To go back to the assessment, we found that the financial management was properly carried out, and we believe that in the financial perspectives for 2014-2020, more resources should be allocated to a context in which adolescence is often subject to serious attack. Information sharing on the web is important, as are Facebook and the Internet, but these, too, can sometimes lead to specific types of addiction. The monitoring centre could propose improvements for supporting multilingualism and we believe that it can improve its work, which is extremely positive, still further by introducing flexible measures in organisational terms. Stronger ties, which, in actual fact, already exist, with other agencies and with the Member States would allow us to confirm that the prospects for growth in this delicate area exist, based on a principle and value which is that of an overall strategy on addiction, and therefore not just on addiction to drugs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight months have now elapsed since we went to Lampedusa, in Sicily, to note and observe at first-hand what had happened during a year of increasing migration flows. However, the tragedies that have taken place in this period have not come to an end one little bit; quite the contrary. Even now, and already since April, other tragedies are being played out: 10 refugees have died en route
, which is a worrying sign from which we can clearly deduce that not everything that might have been done up till now has been done. We have a priority, which is to ensure that this House and the European institutions are seriously committed to three values – solidarity, responsibility and also courage. The Council, no less than the Commission, should probably have been much more courageous. To begin with, this is the case in the negotiations that must deliver more resources in the 2013 budget and the new 2014-2020 financial framework precisely for the protection and security of the EU’s territory, and in the meantime, in cooperation with third countries, remembering the good work done by Frontex, which can and must be improved. There are priorities that cannot be asked of others: bilateral agreements with border countries cannot be put in place by individual Member States. We should like to know what stage the agreement with Libya has reached and whether progress has been made with Tunisia and Egypt. What is more, when it comes to readmission, we need to ensure that readmission, wherever possible, can take place in the territory of origin. The Mediterranean is a thousand-year-old area where the bonds of peace have always existed between the countries on its shores. Now more than ever, however, we have a prospect in which individual Member States cannot cope with an emergency that is European. It is Europe that must take on the burden: strongly, enthusiastically, passionately, immediately and without delay. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE
),

 The tendency shown by the European Commission to focus attention on major hub airports is in complete contrast with the need for connection of areas such as islands and outermost regions, which need full accessibility and territorial integration due to their physical and natural characteristics. Equally, it is important for the European Commission to review Decision 2012/21/EU on the application of Article 106, in order to better understand the vital importance of the impact of these investments on territorial cohesion and social and economic development, especially in regions where other forms of transport are lacking. Furthermore, EU cofinancing by the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), cohesion and regional funds would allow regional airports to play a leading role in the creation of a wider European Common Aviation Area and therefore, during its review of the TEN-T, the Commission needs to recognise the vital link between regional air services and economic regeneration. I therefore remain convinced that future trans-European network policy must guarantee the mobility of people and goods and make regions, including peripheral regions, more attractive, as a practical contribution to revitalising investments and employment in the Single European Market. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, human trafficking is without doubt a heinous crime, but it is also a crime of transnational proportions. Eradicating it requires international cooperation between Member States and third countries, with a pre-eminent role for the EU institutions. We must overcome the exploitation inherent in prostitution, illegal labour and micro-criminality. However, talking about human trafficking without talking about organised crime would be to take a partial approach to such a worrying phenomenon, since human trafficking is very often controlled by organised crime. In the last few days we saw the establishment of the Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (CRIM), of which I am the rapporteur. One of our guiding principles and political priorities will no doubt be to make the very most of our work so as to achieve greater collaboration and cooperation with third countries, because we think that regular and legal migration should be encouraged, while illegal migration should be countered strongly and – if we can manage it – eradicated. We therefore need bilateral agreements between the EU and individual third countries on regulating migratory flows, protecting basic freedoms through strong guarantees, and the involvement of Europol and Frontex in particular. All of which must be done in the pursuit of two principles – solidarity and responsibility – without which there is no way there will be any progress. That is also the overarching direction that we will be giving to the CRIM Committee, and the fact that a directive shortly to be transposed in all the Member States is an essential tool in the fight against human trafficking tells us just how much difference a strong European approach could make to this worrying and ongoing phenomenon.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes a year after another, essentially identical debate. One year ago Lampedusa was overrun, as was the case in Greece this year and in previous years. Mr Busuttil made the point not long ago: 60 000 people came to Lampedusa, but certainly had no intention of staying there. These migrants – economic migrants – arrive in Italy, Greece and Malta, not by any means to stay there but rather to move on to other EU Member States. The answer to this is more Europe, more responsibility, more solidarity and enterprise. Negotiations have been opened on the funds for this area of action over the 2014-2020 planning period and might I suggest that Ms Malmström steps in there, just as the Council is pushing for a more enterprising approach. There is no doubt that there are some obstreperous Member States. What we need to do is overcome this attitude, otherwise Europe will not make any progress in this regard. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Education means using intelligent methods to give expression to each person’s intrinsic potential. Increasing education, training and research is a cornerstone of growth and modernisation in higher education. However, the success of tertiary education also depends on policies to improve the social inclusion of minorities, gender equality and cutting the number of school-leavers. On top of these goals, there is the aim of encouraging institutions to systematically integrate mobility for education purposes within their programmes. Suitable funding is, however, required in order to achieve this: currently it is just 1.3% of gross domestic product, compared with 2.7% in the USA. Language skills are, moreover, in high demand among businesses and good skills in this area improve job prospects. Also connected to this is the equally important subject of e
-learning: the fusion of education and computer literacy, which provides innovative ways for teaching new generations. Europe’s future strength in this area will depend on putting higher education at the heart of innovation, creating jobs and employable skills, and on the ability of higher education institutions to play a full role in the knowledge triangle: connecting teaching, research and business to boost excellence and regional development.

 I voted in favour because I firmly believe that Europe must support the winds of freedom blowing through the Mediterranean, with a strategic commitment to promoting democracy, by means of urgent, concrete help. In this regard, I believe that establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy could be one of the most tangible responses by the European Union to the challenges of democratisation in our neighbourhood. The Arab Spring showed Europe the great aspirations towards democracy of the Mediterranean populations, as well as the urgency of addressing the instability generated by undemocratic regimes in the EU’s neighbourhood. In particular, the events we have witnessed have been surprising for the role played by civil society and the power of popular protest. For this reason, I am very much in favour of the bottom-up approach that will guarantee direct support to civil society. However, this instrument will only be able to operate effectively if clear and transparent rules are adopted for the distribution of funds, inspired by an across-the-board involvement of civil society and pluralistic support for parties and associations.

 Free movement is one of the EU’s most cherished achievements, which is also confirmed by the fact that 88% of European citizens (interviewed) recognise it as the most familiar of the four freedoms introduced by the EU. The programmes relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with increased synergy with other EU programmes, can undoubtedly help to give new impetus to the concept of European citizenship and to dismantle the obstacles that are still restricting it. Accordingly, the proper functioning of the single market is based on dismantling the obstacles to economic and social cohesion in the EU, which can be achieved, as the Commission has reiterated, by updating Directive 2005/36/EC in order to allow for the swifter, less bureaucratic recognition of professional qualifications. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must represent an additional opportunity for Europe to dismantle the further obstacles that still prevent European citizens from fully enjoying their rights as European citizens, and help to build a single market at the service of citizens. Finally, it should be emphasised that while EU citizenship is often considered secondary to national citizenship, it can be used as a ‘preparatory citizenship’ for non-EU citizens who meet certain conditions, such as ‘good conduct’.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, though it may have taken a long time to reach an agreement, there is no doubt that this programme constitutes an instrument of great solidarity and for this reason its success must be warmly welcomed. We are of the opinion that joint resettlement is a great opportunity of redemption for many desperate people looking for protection, people who come from extremely difficult situations and who deserve a willingness on our part that is not just formal but tangible and substantive. There must be a responsible contribution from Member States, given that this is on a voluntary basis. Eurostat has in recent days announced the data: over 300,000 applications. I am pleased to note that the country that ranks first in accepting applications for humanitarian protection is Italy, a country which once again needs the constructive backing of the European Union because, as you will know, landings in Lampedusa have started again on a massive and significant scale. The Italian Government must do a lot, but this tangible backing from the European Union also needs to be there. We are of course opposed to illegal migratory flows, which must be firmly opposed because they are often in the hands of organised crime syndicates, and we are looking at a time period of 2013, and then at 2014-2020, in order to ensure that resettlement programmes may become a real and tangible goal. We would like to acknowledge the rapporteur, on the one hand, and Commissioner Malmström, on the other, for working so hard on this matter. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a joint motion for a resolution on a subject of particular importance – that of discrimination, of aversion to those who must in fact be integrated and welcomed where there is clearly a chance of work or reuniting a family – is undoubtedly helpful. European citizenship is a subject of extraordinary value. We certainly need to be conscious of it; we need to give new life to the theme of reception and integration; we need to bear in mind that there are directives – Directive 2004/38/EC, which is essential in this respect – and while we are working on celebrations for 2013, the designated European Year of Citizens, all this is why we need to remove every obstacle that hitherto has specifically caused these difficulties. In the meantime, the Internet, while it is a key means of knowledge, must definitely be linked to a series of essential requirements to which its users should adhere. Thank you.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important requirement and one that must be supported, just as we must support the advancement of the status of women, not only in the workplace. Important progress has been made in recent decades, including through absolutely cutting-edge EU legislation. Sixty per cent of our graduates are women but there is no doubt that accessing the world of work is tricky when women choose family life as well as work. The family needs to be safeguarded and protected, while the gender gap definitely has to be significantly reduced through well-defined social policies, greater working flexibility and, of course, by protecting vulnerable women. Let us remember that when it comes to trafficking in human beings, it is often women who are the victims, which is also an important subject to which yet further attention must be paid.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have listened carefully to the indications from the Commission about reinforcing judicial training. There is no doubt that this is a top priority, because we believe that the judicial training of magistrates and judicial practitioners serves not only to bring the various legal systems closer together – though they must remain distinct due to the typical characteristics of each – but certainly this mutual tangible cooperation can certainly facilitate what, today more than ever, is the transnational dimension of the law: lawyers, judicial practitioners, who must be supported by a common and consistent judicial training sector, possibly through exchanges via Erasmus, so as to set out an area of freedom, justice and security in which each component can make its own voice heard in a common European market in which competitiveness and sustainability are closely linked to a system of free movement of professions, in which it is important to have high quality assurance standards. For this reason, it is important to have a European professional card, a sort of European accreditation, in a context in which trust – as set out in the Stockholm Programme between the various Member States – should be based on a tangible mutual recognition of judicial orders, so that entry of young judicial practitioners onto the labour market can be facilitated and so that those who have the ability to use more than one language ​can be taken into account. There is still a role for the most important agencies in a context in which the financial perspectives of the 2014-2020 budget will have to be characterised not only by important and significant pilot projects, such as the one that has just been mentioned, but by appropriate and adequate resources so as to expand the number of people benefiting from this programme. Thank you. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that family reunification is an issue of substance, one that is serious and concrete. The welfare of the family must take precedence over anything else, even if it is, of course, undeniable that this right must be subject to rules. In my opinion, the 2003 directive contains useful rules, though they must be applied uniformly and homogeneously within the territory of all Member States. For this reason, the Commission has quite rightly initiated a serious debate by publishing a Green Paper, in which it sets out a clear vision: to introduce concrete measures in support of a process of family reunification which, in my opinion, simply has to be taken into account. I am the rapporteur of a document on information and communications technology, on the transfer of workers who are third-country nationals to establishments located both in third countries and in Europe. In this particular case, a more favourable exception clause was carried in committee to ensure family reunification at a practical level, which is definitely a political priority for the European People’s Party. Of course, language is important, and we must ensure that the European agenda on migratory flows – again in this case we are speaking of legal immigration – takes account of this directive, which is absolutely correct and practical. The Commission’s goal must be to urge Member States to adopt rules that can and will be applied in practice and, at the same time, ensure that the right to be together is truly recognised, one to which no one can object. The PPE’s aim is to ensure that the 500 000 individuals who are potential beneficiaries of this rule are given due consideration by Member States. Susy De Martini  (ECR

 I voted in favour of this report for which I was shadow rapporteur for the ECR Group. However, I believe that it fails to adequately balance the importance of strong bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and the EU with legitimate concerns over the Kingdom’s human rights record. Instead, the report is almost entirely dominated by the latter. In fact, the report does not adequately recognise progress made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in some aspects of human rights and equality, in particular with regard to the role of women. The report also does not properly consider the important role played by Saudi Arabia in counter-terrorism or EU-Saudi trade relations. I therefore feel that, while I am able to vote in favour of the report, I also consider it to be a missed opportunity to engage positively with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, stressing our existing relations with it as a key strategic partner in the region, proposing measures to strengthen EU-Saudi links, and also to work constructively with them to improve their human rights record.

Madam President, I must say to Baroness Ashton, as a physician and a human being, that I have a specific concern, namely about so-called ‘Cuban health diplomacy’. Cuba is sending out doctors under government-to-government cooperation agreements. This practice has now become Cuba’s biggest industry, bringing in USD 6 billion. In Venezuela alone, there are more than 30 000 Cuban doctors, traded for oil; in Brazil there are 6 000 of them. The host countries pay for each doctor about USD 5 000 per month, while the doctors themselves receive only USD 25. These bilateral agreements clearly violate a number of International Labour Organisation conventions. One of the escaped Cuban doctors recently stated, ‘We are the highest qualified slave labour force in the world.’ Are we sure that we should continue to finance Cuba, with EUR 30 million each year?

 Madam President, I am new here, and therefore I thank you twice for giving me the opportunity to speak for the first time. I will now switch to my other mother tongue, Italian. Signora Presidente, l'Iniziativa dei cittadini europei, particolarmente importante in questo momento di sfiducia nei confronti dell'Europa, sembra avere qualche problema di comunicazione e burocratico, com'è già stato rilevato dalla signora Commissario e da altri colleghi. Faccio un esempio pratico su tutti, che riguarda proprio il mio paese, l'Italia: l'Iniziativa sull'acqua pubblica ha raccolto, dopo nove mesi, poco più di 25.000 firme sulle 54.000 necessarie per l'Italia, mentre sullo stesso soggetto, a livello di referendum 
nazionale, erano state raccolte nel 2011, quindi poco fa, in pochi mesi più di un milione di firme. Questa discrepanza di successo fra l'iniziativa di un singolo Stato e quella europea non può essere spiegata se non con le esistenti difficoltà di comunicazione e di ordine burocratico. So che è stata presentata un'iniziativa per semplificare questo diritto d'iniziativa. Sembra un gioco di parole, ma è una realtà che mi fa venire in mente questa frase "Un cammello è l'esatta descrizione di un cavallo fatta da un burocrate". Spero proprio che la Commissione possa porre un veloce rimedio a quanto sta accadendo.Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Sonik had a long and complex task, and overall we should welcome his report. However, it is clear that there are still many doubts about extraction of shale gas and oil. The other speeches we have heard also share this view, in particular with regard to environmental and public health protection. I therefore welcome the series of studies undertaken by the European Commission on potential risks resulting from shale gas extraction. Only on the basis of their results will we be able to give a clear answer and be in a position to adopt a new EU framework Directive for regulating mining activities. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, this proposal for a regulation aims to simplify the current legal framework and to establish new administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, of which there are currently around 30 million in Europe. Until now, the 2002 Framework Directive and 14 other directives referring to it set out the requirements in a rather convoluted legislative framework that is happily being replaced by a consolidated text. A refined vehicle categorisation achieved by introducing more appropriate subcategories, more severe emission limits, the mandatory introduction of anti-lock brake systems on some types of vehicle and the automatic headlight-on system to improve the visibility of L-vehicles are just some of the innovations to be introduced thanks to this report. The benefits to be gained in terms of safety, environmental protection and improved functioning of the internal market are beyond doubt and because of this I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 In a parliamentary democracy, the link between the public nature of debates and votes, and democratic accountability, is inescapable. If we do not give European citizens the ability to know what their elected representatives have said and how they voted, I wonder whether they will be able to hold them to account at the next elections. The review of Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure, through the incorporation of some key elements of the Code of conduct for negotiating in the context of the ordinary legislative procedures in the binding part of the Rules, will make the procedures more effective, more transparent and above all more inclusive. I am convinced that the excellent job done and the measures the report contains will increase transparency and therefore the accountability of the elected representatives at European level.

 The present situation demands a strong response from Parliament in terms of both efficiency and financial savings. The statistics for 2011 show that no Member has ever requested the translation of the entire verbatim report of proceedings in his or her own language. This was a pointless, superfluous expense that should quite rightly be restricted. I fully agree with the solutions explained in the report and with the work done by Mr Ilchev. In particular, the database from which citizens can watch all the video recordings translated into all the official languages is certainly an effective solution for preserving European multilingualism.

 A Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) on 29 April 2008 between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, was signed in Luxembourg. The Commission has proposed an Implementing Regulation to facilitate the application of the Interim Agreement, which lays down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements. Mr Winkler felt that the amendments to the Commission proposal under examination should mirror the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I report. I agree with the rapporteur because this will guarantee the consistency and coherence of the European Parliament’s position on the matter. Consequently the report contains amendments aimed at aligning the amended provisions with the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I Regulation to the five Regulations on the application of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements with the other Western Balkan countries. I fully agree with Mr Winkler’s report, and that is why I have decided to give it my full support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The right of a citizen of an unrepresented Member State to seek assistance from the consular authorities of other Member States that are represented is one of the rights conferred by EU citizenship. It is a right that has existed for some years, but European citizens are still not fully informed of it. As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am more than satisfied with the work done on this report. I believe that the measures adopted will improve the enforcement of this right, through better coordination between Member States on consular representation. The only doubt that remains is how these new measures will be publicised among European citizens. I think that a coordinated campaign of information at European level could be the most effective way of achieving the results we hope for. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr La Via on his excellent work on the report on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013. His task was difficult, and there seemed little likelihood of an agreement between the Member States and the European Parliament. Despite the prolonged period of crisis and constant requests for cuts to EU expenditure, Mr La Via and Mr Vaughan together managed to ensure continuity for current policies and initiatives. I think it was particularly important that any slowing down of the pilot projects in the areas of energy and the environment was avoided, a clear sign of the good work carried out by the European Parliament in defending the prerogatives of the European Union. I have therefore given my full support to this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with I would like to recall that the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 are proceeding in a very difficult social, economic and financial context. I regret to say that the European Union is increasingly seen by citizens as an additional burden to be borne by taxpayers, rather than an important resource. I am convinced that this situation is caused by the fact that the EU budget is not in line with national budgets, since it has not been expanded to take account of the duties and competencies assigned to the Union under the Treaty of Lisbon, or of the important political Decisions taken by the European Council. I voted in favour of the report because I was aware of the need to reach an interinstitutional compromise and to send a clear signal to citizens. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Commission’s proposal to amend Article 103o of the Single CMO Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007), which provides for the possibility for Member States to grant decoupled aid to vine growers under the single payment scheme (SPS), definitely needed to be amended. I endorse Mr Dorfmann’s work and the proposals he put forward, as they ensure farmers receive predictable payments of aid. The report also effectively confronts the current changing situation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. Above all, it was important to avoid Member States planning five-year decisions that are actually not compatible with the Commission’s proposal for a new system of direct support, just as it was essential to link the calendar for the final transfer decision to the calendar of the future reform. All these problems were considered in the report and the solutions reached are very positive. This is why I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has been in use since 2008 as a free service to Member States with a view to improving the exchange of information within the internal market. To date, the IMI system still operates on the basis of a Commission decision and a Commission recommendation and, as a result, lacks a single legal instrument. This has been a major obstacle to further expansion of the IMI system, which should have been overcome long ago. We have seen that the system has worked perfectly with regard to the Professional Qualifications Directive and the Services Directive. The system has proven its value as a rapid and secure means for cross-border information exchange and administrative cooperation with currently over 6 000 registered authorities in all EU Member States and EEA (European Economic Area) countries. Therefore, I welcome the report’s proposals and I hope that the expansion in IMI application to other sectors will have clear benefits for citizens and for the internal market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation No 73/2009, which provides the rules for the current system of direct payments to farmers, will be superseded by other proposals under the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform for 2014-2020 In its proposals for the multiannual financial framework and the CAP for 2014-2020, the Commission is proposing to make use of a new crisis reserve to address additional financing needs resulting from unexpected agricultural crises. The net ceiling in 2013 for EU Member States would be equal to the value of the net ceiling in 2012, with the adjustments deriving from grubbing-up in 2012 and the appraised transfer of the wine envelopes to the single payment scheme. I agree with the solution contained in the report and therefore I voted in favour of Mr Capoulas Santos’s proposal, because I think we need to maintain the current financial structure for 2013 in order to ensure continued levels of payments and to support agricultural development in an effective way. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting animal welfare standards is part of and complementary to sustainable development policy. European institutions, as signatories to the agreement on sustainable development, must do all they can to ensure these standards are adequate. The deterioration in the state of health of wild animals could result in an increased spread of contagious diseases to domestic animals and, at the same time, have an adverse effect on public health; I voted in favour of Ms Paulsen’s proposal, since I think the current regulations need to be better enforced, with special focus on the animal transport sector. I welcome the inclusion in the strategy of a European animal welfare framework law and join in Ms Paulsen’s call for this law to be clearly formulated, followed by a consultation with all relevant parties.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until now, the Commission has been financing programmes such as MED 2007-2013 and the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument for cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Now that the 2007-2013 financial programming period is coming to an end, I think we need to ask the Commission to start a process of dialogue and consultation in order to define future macro-regional strategies. Priority areas to be targeted by future support still have to be identified, and that must be done while taking into account the need to strengthen existing cooperation, particularly between areas of Europe belonging to different Member States but sharing the same services and working area. I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s motion for a resolution because I consider the Mediterranean to be a coherent whole, a single cultural and environmental area in which joint priorities such as crops, renewable energy sources and tourism can be shared. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a single European railway area provides a major opportunity to support economic recovery and make the single market more competitive. The variety of national railway systems hampers this process: numerous legislative barriers slow down development in the sector and limit the competitiveness of rail transport. We should establish transparent rules on access to rail-related services and service facilities, such as freight terminals, maintenance facilities and marshalling yards. Ms Serracchiani’s report is a step in that direction, and that is why I voted for it. The Council is calling for too long a period – up to 36 months – for this new directive to enter into force. Accordingly, I endorse the rapporteur’s request to set a period of 12 months for the transposition of the entire directive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by improving the harmonised control of driving time and rest periods, digital tachographs can play a vital role in ensuring that the internal road haulage market functions properly, which will greatly benefit road safety. A number of recent police reports from certain Member States have shown that fraudulent use of these devices has risen, and therefore a change to the regulation in force is urgently required. According to the Commission, the increased cost of purchasing a new tachograph is expected to be around EUR 5 per vehicle, which is negligible compared with the potential benefits that could accrue. I voted in favour of Ms Ţicău’s proposal because I believe tachographs and vehicle satellite tracking systems should be synchronised to make services more efficient and more reliable. The ability to transmit tachograph data remotely will also lead to better control and a substantial improvement in road safety. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we look back at some of the serious environmental disasters we are all familiar with, we can see that there have been numerous cases where disastrous environmental consequences have followed industrial accidents. These cases also show that at times the impact of accidents can extend beyond national borders. I have voted in favour of my fellow Member’s proposal since I believe Directive 96/82/EC must be replaced so that the existing protection levels are not only maintained, but strengthened. I also think that the new provisions should be clearer, consistent and easily understandable, in order to contribute to the streamlining of administrative procedures. Finally, I would argue it is necessary to keep a certain amount of flexibility to be able to amend Annex I to deal with any unwanted effects of the alignment to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and any subsequent adjustments to that regulation that could have an impact on the classification of dangerous substances.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses establishes general provisions regarding the composition and manufacture of said foods. This directive’s provisions mostly date back to 1977 and no longer meet the needs of today's consumers. Therefore an in-depth revision of the directive was needed and for this reason I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s proposal. I would still argue that it is absolutely necessary to protect consumers more, simplify regulations and tackle the difficulties that Member States and operators encounter in interpreting the various existing pieces of food legislation. This would mean similar products could be treated in the same way throughout the Union, creating a level playing field for all internal market operators and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and end-consumers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to the development of the economy and society. However, to make the most of these potentials, first they need to be made secure. The many disputes regarding existing legislation on data privacy and intellectual property rights enforced in the Internet environment should give us much food for thought. I supported Mr Kalfin’s proposal because I believe that the potential offered by the web, in terms of both innovation and growth for European enterprises, must not be lost, especially in a highly competitive context such as currently exists at global level. Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that I believe in the need for a rapid implementation of the European programme for critical information infrastructure protection (ECIP), including the creation of the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to climate change, the steady rise in environmental pollution, industrialisation and the increasing population growth, we are facing global energy challenges. I believe it would be useful to strengthen the external dimension of EU energy policy by taking a clear stance on the diversification of energy sources and routes. I voted in favour of Ms Herczog’s proposal because I think it is essential to guarantee security of supply and, at the same time, to support sustainable production and consumption. I firmly hope, however, that in the future, we will have greater coordination between Member States’ policies and joint action and solidarity in the field of external energy policy and energy security. In this respect, we must recognise the importance of transparency and implementation of the internal energy market. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted for this resolution in the belief that introducing new taxes will not, in itself, solve our problems; nevertheless, the introduction of certain taxes may lead to a reduction in taxation in other sectors. The financial sector is not contributing in a fair way to the cost of the global crisis at a time when EU citizens are faced with an increase in direct and indirect taxation and severe cuts in wages and pensions. The financial sector is still exempted from taxation in its activities and transactions. I therefore support Ms Podimata’s proposal, which envisages a taxation rate of 0.1% in respect of transactions other than those related to derivatives arrangements, and 0.01% in respect of transactions related to derivatives arrangements, which would generate new revenues of EUR 57 billion at EU level. I have one final comment to make: I would point out that, according to a Eurobarometer poll carried out in June 2011, a large majority of EU citizens are in favour of bringing in these measures. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the single market was conceived as a vital tool for steering Europe towards sustainable growth and full employment. If fully developed, it could provide a useful antidote to the economic crisis that has gripped Europe and the world for several years now. To that end, its supporting directives need to be properly transposed, applied and implemented. I therefore agree with Mr Busuttil’s proposals, which emphasise the need to implement these directives in order to be able to exploit the single market’s economic potential. The SOLVIT network has been shown to be a useful, effective tool for providing clear, timely solutions for citizens and businesses, thus helping to solve the problems associated with the misapplication of competition rules. As a non-judicial entity, the network is ideally placed to operate economically and effectively. I therefore hope that SOLVIT will be further reinforced and promoted to European citizens.

 Mr President, despite Turkey’s recent efforts and progress, culminating in the meeting between the Turkish Minister for Family and Social Policies and representatives from the Committee on Equal Opportunities, a number of important outstanding gender equality issues remain. Given that Turkey is a candidate country, the present gap will have to be bridged completely for it to be able to achieve current European Union standards. I am concerned, in particular, by the recent data on the safety and protection of women. It emerges that 39% of Turkish women have been attacked at least once in their lives. I agree with Mr Bozkurt’s proposal to encourage the Turkish Government to act swiftly to implement the measures needed to reduce the number of attacks. Finally, I would like to stress the importance of access to information and to education in ensuring gender mainstreaming at all educational levels. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the potential afforded by the new channels of communication is huge. In a world in which everything is digital, information is an asset for every European citizen. The European Union needs to protect all end users and try to reduce the existing disparities between Member States on the European market to a minimum. I would like to point out that, as the promoter of a single internal market, the European Union must also implement an internal telecommunications market. The significant differences between domestic and roaming prices obviously make these difficult goals to meet. I agree with Ms Niebler’s proposal. Each home provider must give customers clear and adequate information about the levels of consumption they have reached and agreed. Transparent information about the conclusion of contracts and the charges for data roaming services will be an appropriate means for protecting European consumers and I therefore voted in favour of the report.

 The European Union has a crucial role in European environmental policy. By signing Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, entering into the Rotterdam Convention, the EU has set itself the goal of incentivising and increasing information exchange about the chemicals traded between the parties to the convention and also to implement the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. The measure ensures that exporting countries of chemicals formally obtain consent from the importing countries before the export can take place. Mr Jørgensen’s proposal aims to limit the derogations usually adopted against the PIC procedure, thereby trying to defend the original meaning of the Convention. The joint intervention of the Commission and the designated national authorities will also be of significant help. This synergy will undoubtedly result in more accurate and reliable documentation on the possible impact on human health or the environment of using dangerous chemical substances in the importing country or another exporting country.

 Despite the fact that the situation in Myanmar is still far from what international institutions – the European Union in the first place – expect for the future, the progress achieved by the nation under the leadership of President Thein Sein can be seen by one and all. A political process has begun that has given rise to a series of radical changes: the satisfactory outcome of the by-elections held on 1 April; the release of a significant number of political prisoners; the adoption of a series of legislative and governmental measures aimed at increasing openness, from the initiation of economic reforms to the easing of press and Internet censorship and the promulgation of laws on freedom of association and the freedom to strike; and the initiation of a process of dialogue with the main ethnic groups. While recognising the still undeveloped context in which this process of opening and national reconciliation is taking place, the transition from a military to a civilian government and the democratic opposition’s possibility to be represented are basic aspects. Finally, I would like to emphasise that, in this sense, it was the firm diplomatic actions of Italy, Germany and France that led to the gradual easing of EU sanctions and to a gradual evolution of political and democratic structures in Burma.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps there has been an error in communication, but I had asked to speak to explain my vote. In the past decade we have witnessed a series of well-known dramatic events which have led to a consequent increase in the number of controls and restrictions in air travel. Meanwhile, the European Union, the USA, Canada and Australia have signed a variety of international agreements on the processing and storage of passenger data. Parliament already expressed its willingness to revise such agreements in May 2010, when it decided to reject the outcome of the negotiations between the countries involved. I am aware of the fact that the competent parliamentary committee has judged this agreement unsuitable, nonetheless I think it is more useful to maintain this new agreement, rather than referring to the current legislation. Since it is not possible to start new negotiations, it would be better to adopt these new measures and improve the previous framework with regard to data protection and the respect for individual rights. The rejection of these new results would deprive Europe of any minimum law in this field, and of any effective tool in combating terrorism and organised crime. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its Member States have always promoted sustainable development and the protection of the environment and human health. The signing of the Kyoto Protocol and the Europe 2020 strategy are among the most important challenges that the EU has set itself. Taxation related to CO2
 emissions is a cost-effective means for Member States to achieve the reductions of greenhouse gasses necessary according to Decision 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. I am in favour of Ms Lulling’s proposal on the need to ensure that the internal market functions in an optimum manner in a context of new requirements relating to the limitation of climate change, to the use of renewable energy sources and to energy savings. Consistent treatment of energy sources should be guaranteed in order to provide a genuine level playing field for energy consumers regardless of the energy source used. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the approval of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World and the resolution on the EU’s support for the International Criminal Court, the European Parliament voted to act in a manner consistent and in conformity with EU obligations concerning the protection of human rights. Implementing national strategies already drawn up in recent months will be an important step in this direction. I agree with Mr Howitt’s proposal to call on the Commission to insert a ‘torture end-use’ clause into the 2005 Council Regulation concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture, etc. This would enable Member States to acquire detailed information and decide whether or not to refuse the export of the goods and substances in question.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have witnessed fast economic growth on the part of Azerbaijan, whose economic potential is obvious to all. We must also recognise that there has been a strengthening of the strategic role of that country as an Eastern partner, in particular, in the energy sector. However, we must remember here that the gap in terms of democracy and the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights compared to the standards required by the European Union has not yet been completely bridged. I believe that these principles should be considered essential for the proper conduct of the negotiations and the stipulation of an association agreement with Azerbaijan. I hope that the Council and the Commission will be urging the Azerbaijani authorities to adopt an anti-discriminatory legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Meanwhile, we should welcome the reforms made by the Azerbaijani authorities in the judiciary in the last year, which should ensure greater independence of judges, and eliminate corruption in this area.

 The principal aim of cohesion policy and of the policy on the internal market is to organise policy initiatives directed towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, encouraging an economy with a high rate of employment that favours social and territorial cohesion. Nevertheless, the initial conditions in which the outermost regions (ORs) find themselves present an obstacle to, and a brake on, achieving the objectives that have been set, in particular, in the Europe 2020 strategy. As the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides, the ORs have a right to be treated differently, which enables them to benefit from the maximum level of aid, irrespective of their level of development. In this sense, I welcome the Commission’s plan to include a budget line for ‘Outermost regions and regions with a very low population density’ in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. I fully agree with the advisability of outermost regions pursuing the main objectives defined in the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I consider that we must emphasise the need to modulate the objectives in accordance with each outermost region’s own situation, taking into account their regional diversity, their structural conditions and their potential benefits.

 The current economic and financial crisis in Europe calls for the adoption of robust, decisive measures to stimulate economic growth. Of course, tax revenue is one of the most important tools with which the Member States can tackle the problems associated with the crisis. I warmly welcome the proposal put forward by Mr Casa. I think that it is essential to create a European fiscal union that includes a comprehensive, rapid, efficient and user friendly exchange of information among Member States in order to improve the fight against tax evasion and to optimise the revenue paid into Member States’ coffers. I hope that we can rise above partisan positions and that common sense will prevail at this difficult time. We must come to an agreement and find new resources in order to deal with the crisis.

 Respect for, and the defence of, human rights and democratic values are the fundamental principles on which the European Union is based. Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: ‘In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women’. On 7 July 2011, the European Parliament welcomed the initiative of establishing the European Endowment for Democracy, as did subsequently the Foreign Affairs Council. I agree with this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation, and I urge the Council to outline the methods for its creation. I believe that establishment of the Endowment could be a tangible and practical response by the European Union to the challenges posed by countries calling for greater democracy. I hope that this can take place as soon as possible, also in view of the timing imposed on us by the ‘Arab Spring’. The situation of instability afflicting the Middle East is clear and before our eyes, and we have to respond to it. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The inclusion of Kosovo in the stabilisation and association process (SAP), thanks to which it could benefit from EU assistance (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, IPA) and an independent preferential trade system, would ensure that Kosovo does not remain on the sidelines of the EU’s strategy in the area of the Western Balkans. In its communication of October 2011 on the enlargement strategy, the Commission showed how the post-election period of adjustment prevented Kosovo from making substantial progress in terms of reforms. On the other hand, in its conclusions of 5 December 2011, the Council called upon Kosovo to implement the actions decided on to compensate for these failings. I agree and support the Commission’s intention to carry out a feasibility study for the stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Kosovo. This commitment confirms the wish and commitment of the EU to carry forward the initiatives outlined in the General Affairs Council conclusions of December 2011 and, at the same time, shows that it can make a significant contribution in socio-political terms, which will be essential for reaching an agreement between Priština and Belgrade on the delicate issue of regional cooperation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before my explanation of vote, I would like to explain that I am wearing this T-shirt because I would like to ask the European Union to take decisive steps to secure the liberation of the two Italian soldiers, Captain Massimiliano Latorre and Sergeant Salvatore Girone, who have been unjustly detained for doing their duty against piracy. Mr President, the new general guidelines of the European Parliament on the 2013 budget will define the guidelines, objectives and strategies to be followed by the Commission when preparing the draft budget. The report in question sets out the key points for reviving the European economy in the light of the effects of, and the issues caused by, the ongoing nature of the economic crisis. I welcome the initiative not just because it makes the EU budget an ideal vehicle for encouraging cohesion between Member States, but also because it embodies an opportunity to review and adapt the new budget to the needs of the economic crisis that has hit the euro area. The initiative proposed by Mr La Via has my full support, and I especially welcome the request made to the Council not to make artificial cuts that do not take into account the effective absorption capacity of the programmes and consequently delay the implementation of cohesion policies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I travelled personally to Macedonia during the last presidential elections as an envoy of the Group of the European People’s Party (PPE) in order to support Prime Minister Gruevski’s electoral campaign. Having met thousands of people, I was able to observe personally that it is not just the institutions but also the people who are decisively in favour of joining the European Union. This is why I believe we cannot put off starting negotiations, which have been suspended, for much longer, and should resume them as a matter of urgency. The 2011 progress report presented by the Commission shows that for the third consecutive year, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has managed to maintain positive progress in line with European standards in terms of political criteria and the development of a market economy. Therefore, I am confident that FYROM will manage to overcome the political and structural limitations that are still holding it back, and give my full support to the resumption of negotiations.

 The recent instalment of the new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 10 February brought an end to the political stalemate that had been created in the country and had stunted its development. This provides an excellent foundation for reviving the European agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among the most significant actions taken by the new government, I should like to point out the initiatives to bring in a census, the adoption of the laws on State aid and the adaptation of the country’s constitution to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I support the motion tabled by Ms Pack: we must urge the Bosnian authorities to make further efforts and take further steps to meet the EU accession criteria. That said, I think it is essential that Bosnia and Herzegovina complies with the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the Sejdić-Finci case and with Article 2 of the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA), which give greater guarantees on human rights and democratic principles. The decision to dissolve the local office of the High Representative is quite correct and I think it will promote a greater sense of responsibility among the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999, with the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European signatory countries committed to working together to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. This target would have guaranteed academic quality, economic development and social cohesion, and employment and lifelong learning for graduates. I support Mr Berlinguer’s report because it calls for decisive and coordinated action at European level. The recognition of degrees based on an efficient system of quality assurance constitutes a good point of departure for encouraging Member States to adopt the national framework of qualifications for lifelong learning. It is essential to implement and develop a European system of higher education that allows and encourages the free movement of knowledge. I think the measures contained in the report represent the right path to follow to make Europe more productive and competitive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that currently, 1.5 billion people in the world are unable to access energy sources. Globally, forecasts indicate that over the next two decades, the funds allocated to energy will amount to USD 26 trillion – just 3% of that sum would ensure universal access to energy by 2030. The proposal put forward by Mr Neuser concerning the possibility of developing and extending access to modern energy services should be a starting point for the EU to begin to address the problem of poverty and sustainable development through targeted, effective action. I agree with Mr Neuser’s proposals: we Europeans must also make our contribution towards improving energy access for the poor in developing countries. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

In this regard, the Commission’s intention to strengthen the legal framework on savings taxation and the review of taxation on energy products is a positive step. Although Member States have expressed diverging opinions on the validity and efficacy of this initiative, overall, I welcome Mr Schmidt’s report and this is why I decided to support it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schwab’s report shows how EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits for consumers. The use of flexible, dynamic procedures has enabled competition policy to act as a driver and not as an obstacle to the European financial and economic system.

In particular, I support the aim of improving price transparency in order to stimulate competition in the market and protect consumer rights. At a time of recession, we absolutely have to try and incentivise consumers.

 The reluctance of Member States to take steps to harmonise some aspects of their respective systems of procedural law does no good for the States themselves or, above all, for European citizens. The ‘by stages’ approach adopted by the Commission is proving to be a winning strategy. However, I think Parliament ought to make itself heard before the Council in order to try and speed up the process for adopting the other directives in this area. Having to talk, in 2011, about rules on the entitlement of suspected and accused persons to be informed of their rights and of the charge against them in criminal proceedings within EU Member States seems, to say the least, like something of an anachronism.

 The legislative vacuum in the EU on protecting victims of crime from further attacks once the victims have left their Member State of origin was a serious and unacceptable flaw in a united Europe. The European Union is not merely about the single market and economic interests; this report is one demonstration of that fact. The solutions in the proposal will, at long last, allow victims of violence to benefit from a guaranteed level of protection that is the same as in the Member State that granted the measures. I completely agree with the report by Ms Barrio and Ms López and therefore voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 I would like to congratulate Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes for their work, both earlier on the parliamentary committee and on the Conciliation Committee. While I understand the Council’s reasons, the situation the Member State economies were in required an austerity-based response, and in this sense, the compromise agreement we have reached is a satisfactory solution. I share Commissioner Lewandowski’s doubts, but I would like to reiterate that the possibility of adopting an amending budget at a later date, should it not be possible to meet the payments, has rightly been included in the joint statement by the Parliament and the Council. Finally, I am pleased that we have managed to honour our promises on the immigration policy appropriations. We cannot predict what repercussions the political situation in the Maghreb may have, and we must be prepared and in possession of the right tools to deal with any emergency. Therefore, I hope the subject can be the subject of debate in this House. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe and its history speak through the huge achievements that have distinguished the development of civilisation in our countries. Much of Europe’s history is told through the roads, the monuments and the convents that, in times of darkness, have given dignity to the journey of the peoples of Europe. I support the stance taken in this measure which, naturally, perhaps ought to be extended to the countries waiting to join the EU, the Western Balkan countries, because I think it would be a good idea to involve them in this project of identifying a European brand. I think their involvement would send out a positive message to them. I am delighted that this measure has been adopted today by a broad majority and this further assures me that the Council cannot throw up further obstacles to its swift approval.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the railway sector has always been something of a special case, where the competitive ethos of the single market and the European Union has taken root rather late. The deficiencies in the services that this sector offers to citizens are linked precisely to this lateness. I am convinced that more transparent and smoother conditions for accessing the market, together with explicit rules on conflicts of interest and discriminatory practices in the railway sector, will be the right measures to spur on greater competition. I completely agree with the legislative proposal on the complete, mandatory separation between infrastructure managers and businesses operating the transport services, namely train companies. I invite the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on this within the pre-established timeframes. I believe that the measures contained in the report will allow us to make it easier to provide train services, boosting the quality offered to passengers and people using freight services. Ms Serrachiani’s report provides tangible responses to the request for greater liberalisation and competition in the railway sector and accordingly I have given it my full support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s motion is a bold step in the right direction. Despite the austerity required by the Member States and by the domestic budget deficits, the European Union is duty bound to do everything it can to ensure growth and employment in Europe. I completely agree with Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes and therefore voted in favour of the resolution. The crisis must not be tackled solely through austerity measures, but also through investment in research and in the cohesion policy. Administrative costs must be kept in check and Parliament has sent out a clear and firm message on this. I hope, however, that good sense will prevail in the next meeting of the Conciliation Committee. The Council must open its eyes and realise that cutting competitiveness and cohesion will only sink our economy even deeper into the mire. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, although it is important to reduce the emission of gaseous pollutants and pollutants produced by internal combustion engines in non-road mobile machinery, we cannot turn a blind eye to the current situation in which manufacturers find themselves. Since 2008, the financial and economic crisis has hit the non-road mobile machinery sector hard. It was essential for us to further extend the flexibility scheme for the transition from Stage III A to Stage III B. The increase in the number of engines used for application in land-based machines under the flexibility scheme, from 20% to 37.5%, is, in my opinion, an unsatisfactory result for European industry in this sector. However, given the situation and Parliament’s continual delays, manufacturers were demanding a rapid response. I would like to specify that it is for this reason alone that I decided to support the report with my vote. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, fully agree with the general approach of Ms Rühle’s report, and I therefore voted in favour. I am convinced that the measures adopted will provide legal certainty, on the one hand, and clearer rules and more flexible procedures for public procurement, on the other. I endorse Ms Rühle’s view that it is the public procurement directives themselves which are the main impediment to involving public contracting authorities in the pursuit of general social aims: the criterion of the lowest price cannot carry the same weight as that of the most economically advantageous tender. It must be stipulated that contracts are to be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender. Only then will the criteria for selecting what is most economically advantageous be easier to implement. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, European consumers’ confidence in the financial system has been severely tested in the last few months, and the Belgian case is clear evidence of this. I am convinced that the system of compensating the potential losses of consumers in the event of bankruptcy of financial institutions or insurance companies, together with insurance guarantee schemes, could make a precious contribution to reducing the risks of policyholders and beneficiaries. I voted in favour of this report. However, I would like to emphasise that, until now, European consumers have not had access to sufficient information in cases of insurance company insolvency. This information must be easily accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible, but, above all, consumers must be clearly told which authority they can apply to should they need to claim compensation.

 Madam President, the legal mechanism devised as a temporary solution for adapting the value-added tax (VAT) system to the abolition of the internal borders is showing its limitations and shortcomings. There is a high level of exposure to fraud, a problem that must be solved as soon as possible. Furthermore, if we think about the considerable increase in commercial transactions between tradespeople based in different Member States and about the rise in the provision of cross-border services, reform of the VAT system appears obvious and inevitable. I voted for Mr Casa’s report, but I still believe that the reverse charge mechanism needs to be explored further. In particular, we are not currently able to forecast what the effects would be of concentrating the financial risk exclusively on the retailer. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we have been able to establish which new and important powers have been granted to the European Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Commission’s proposals for improved economic governance are crucially important for our economic growth and, in particular, for that of the countries in the euro area. The improvements made by the European Parliament with a view to the creation of a robust and coherent legislative framework are clear. I support the general approach of this report, and accordingly voted in favour of it. We have new responsibilities to shoulder; the package of measures must be further improved and enhanced. I believe that we should focus more on preventing unsustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies, but above all that Parliament should be given a prominent role in the surveillance process, with regular, systematic debates and public hearings held in Parliament itself. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what clearly emerges from this report is that many European regions find it difficult to administer the Structural Funds made available by the Union through its cohesion policies. They often find themselves caught in a maze in which, if the regions succeed in organising the administration of these funds, it is often the national governments that then find it difficult to activate the cofinancing funds. Sometimes it is like a dog chasing its own tail: the money that we consider fundamental for growth and cohesion in Europe cannot then be spent, as it now appears is happening in my own country, Italy, as well. I have therefore voted in favour of this report, but I believe that, on the one hand, we should speed up the adoption of the new economic programming period 2014-2020 to enable the individual Member States and regions of Europe to prepare themselves in time and, on the other, that the cofinancing mechanism should perhaps be reviewed. That could be a way forward and so I have voted in favour, but I think a lot more needs to be done to ensure that European funds can actually be spent to benefit the people. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report shows that the social cost of road accidents is enormous, standing at an estimated EUR 130 billion per year. Mr Koch’s proposals are along the right lines and I particularly support the idea of creating the role of EU road safety coordinator. However, I think that we do need to come up with targets and measures that are far more ambitious than those put forward by the Commission thus far; above all, I think that Parliament ought to make its presence felt to the Commission. We cannot accept the fact that in recent years, the European Union’s budget for road safety measures has been slashed. We are therefore duty-bound to ensure that this trend is reversed as soon as possible and that road safety receives greater funding. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forecasts in Mr Caspary’s report on gross domestic product and export growth in the European Union are truly disheartening. We cannot continue to plan our commercial strategy on the premise that the current situation in international trade will remain. The Global Europe strategy has been a failure and I think that the Commission ought to investigate the reasons behind this. We need critical and detailed analysis, but especially an overview of how to deal with future economic challenges. The commercial policy must be coordinated with the European Union’s other economic policies, but, above all, it needs to be accompanied by a parallel policy to combat the phenomenon of population decline. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced countless innovations, including one which in my view deserves greater attention: the Protocol on the role of national parliaments. In the Protocol, national parliaments are called upon to actively uphold the principle of subsidiarity during the legislative process. I voted in favour of this report. Nevertheless, I wish to stress that, so far, very little has been done. Applying this Protocol would meet our citizens’ need, albeit only in part, for democratic legitimacy, and overcome that feeling of remoteness which surrounds the European institutions. I think that a need felt so keenly by our citizens deserves greater attention. I therefore hope that further measures are adopted as soon as possible. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only endorse the text of this report. Mr Meyer has rightly highlighted the need to create a European one-stop shop. The creation of such facilities remains the main goal yet to be achieved. However, the statistics in the report clearly show that there is a significant lack of information at European level, not only with regard to the public’s right of petition, but also in terms of the so-called informal mechanisms. For example, SOLVIT has shown that it works properly, swiftly and effectively, but this has not changed the fact that our fellow citizens only marginally avail themselves of this service. I wonder whether it would not be more appropriate to organise a media campaign at European level on these topics instead of merely improving the Parliament website, which is an important communication tool, but which does not reach every citizen at the moment. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around half of all CO2 
emission-intensive industrial projects in developing countries have some form of export credit agency support. These projects usually present a high environmental and social risk. Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the scale of this phenomenon, since the agencies themselves have no data or rules on transparency of information. This situation is completely at odds with our environmental policy. I wonder whether it would not be worth looking at the scale of this phenomenon in more depth. Mandatory risk calculations are a first step. However, even clearer rules are needed in order to direct these forms of financial support towards the carbon reduction target that we have set ourselves. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by Mr Bütikofer. The EU needs a strong industrial base on which to grow, and this cannot be achieved without an adequate supply of raw materials. Once again, we are being penalised because there is no common aim at international level. How can we dream of asserting our interests when dealing with countries such as China without a cohesive European Union? I am convinced that European raw materials diplomacy is the right solution to the supply crisis. I hope that the adopted proposals will be acted on and that the role of the European External Action Service will gradually be strengthened in the near future. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union specifies that the regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework shall be adopted by the Council after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Article 312(5) requires the three institutions to work together to find a solution ‘throughout the procedure leading to the adoption of the financial framework’, i.e. prior negotiation is required. As Mr Böge stated in his report, this negotiation has not taken place. The Council asked Parliament simply for approval, with no attempt to reach a common solution. Not even Parliament’s wish for greater flexibility has been addressed by the Council. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that Parliament cannot consent to this proposal for a draft Council regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. I hope that for all future proposals, this institution’s voice will be heard, as, moreover, required by Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The European Union, together with all the democratic institutions of the Member States, has an inescapable duty to guarantee public safety against a global phenomenon such as terrorism. This is a duty that often involves the difficult task of reconciling limitations on certain freedoms with guaranteeing safety. Most concerns arise from the civil aviation sector. Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report contributes to the discussion and joint consideration by the three institutions with a view to adopting new measures and moving forward on this task. I agree with the call to implement harmonised rules across the EU regulating operating conditions and common standards for the detection performance of scanners, which is why I fully support the work done by my colleague.

) Mr President, Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public law enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers’ interests. As we know, the regulation proposes to achieve its aims by establishing an EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws in the Member States. In the light of recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection, I agree on the need to update the legislation. By removing the irrelevant laws, we will ease consumer protection cooperation between the national enforcement authorities. I think the amendments set out in Mr Repo’s report will successfully translate our pre-established objectives into reality and improve legal certainty, so I therefore voted in favour.

Mr Wagner’s report clearly shows the importance of an integrated European energy network, in order to be able to guarantee security of supply and diversification of sources. I believe that in order to achieve these objectives, enshrined also in the recent Treaty of Lisbon, it is right to give priority to energy infrastructures, which the Commission also considers to be outdated and poorly interconnected. We must face this infrastructure deficit, and the measures contained in Mr Wagner’s report do precisely this. The difficulties and crises in bilateral relations between energy consumer countries and producer countries are further proof of the fact that we have to think to the future, to an energy policy for the European Union. Mr Wagner’s report is a first step in this direction, and therefore I have given him my support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the significance of this report, only 19 Member States reported on core indicators. This situation does not allow us to have a clear picture of the impact of cohesion policy on the ground. I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr Mikolášik, and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one, as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies. The organisation of public debates and consultations with stakeholders, together with the submission of reports to national parliaments for opinions are further positive measures in this sense. We have to make efforts to prevent a reduction in the funding made available for cohesion policy in the next programming period. For this reason, I supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights presented by the Commission has the merit of combining the four previous directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument. I agree with the report’s objectives. It is essential to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers in the 27 Member States and at the same time take into due account the need for manufacturers, regardless of their size, to provide their goods and services to European consumers without having to deal with unnecessary legal barriers. As things currently stand, the elimination of legal fragmentation is a difficult result to achieve. Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report also rightly expresses doubts as to whether full harmonisation could produce different effects to those expected. I therefore voted in favour, because I am convinced that it would be useful to make an amendment to the Commission’s proposal, achieving minimum harmonisation and at the same time guaranteeing a high-level service to consumers.

 My colleague Mr Casini’s report confronts and makes a positive contribution towards resolving the problems associated with interpreting and applying Rule 51 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I fully share Mr Casini’s view that it did not suffice to refer to a sole interpretation and to the guidelines intended to facilitate implementation. The conditions for the application of the procedure with joint meetings of committees and a joint vote – and I am referring in particular to the criteria of ‘competence and major importance’ of the matter in question – are clear and suited to eliminating the legal uncertainties that have existed up until now. I offer my congratulations for the good work accomplished, and I hope that this report is able to facilitate the work of Parliament by means of greater use of this procedure. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 We are currently witnessing radical changes in the international order; changes to which the European Union can no longer be a mere spectator. I think the European Union should see this as a starting point and take a truly active role in dealing with both current and emerging world powers, shaking off once and for all its reputation as a political dwarf in terms of international policy. In the same vein, I agree with the need expressed in Mr Lambsdorff’s proposal for the Member States to exert pressure during discussions to reform the United Nations Security Council in order to obtain a permanent seat for the European Union. By strengthening the role of the European Union at the United Nations, we will succeed in ensuring that the EU takes a leading role in regional and global affairs. Otherwise, we shall have to keep facing up to the continuous lack of coordination of Member States’ interests on the international scene. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Despite a series of hindrances – such as the economic crisis, the persistent inability to close the gap with the United States and increasing competition from emerging countries – the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has proved that it can offer added value to European research and development. FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Looking at Mr Audy’s report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium–sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility. With a view to negotiating the future financial perspective from 2014, these measures will pave the way for the Europeanisation of research. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The data in the report by Mrs Hirsch is alarming: the youth unemployment rate is now 21%, twice the average rate of unemployment at EU level. The motion contains useful ideas and should surely be seen in a positive light, yet I am convinced that we need to provide adequate financial resources in order to properly tackle the challenges posed by the Copenhagen Process and the EU 2020 strategy, for instance through the Structural Funds and, in particular, through the European Social Fund. With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States. Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market, I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’.

Mr President, the proposal for a regulation on which we are being called to vote undoubtedly has the merit of bringing together in a single text all the existing legislation relating to textile products. This regulation will make it possible to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework on the development and use of new fibres, as well as supporting the development of innovative products and encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector. I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list. While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation.

Mr President, making it easy for citizens to scrutinise how decisions are made, together with the processes, elements and resources that influenced them, helps both to ensure greater transparency and to close the gap between the European institutions and citizens, which is often discussed in relation to legitimacy and to the so-called democratic deficit in the European Union. Great progress has been made in the last few years. One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission’s 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a ‘one-stop shop’ register for lobbyists. The approval of the Stubb-Friedrich report by this House led to the creation of a joint working group. We can safely say that the results achieved by that group with regard to the objectives set by Parliament are more than satisfactory. I fully agree with Mr Casini’s report, as the transparency of political institutions is a fundamental condition of their legitimacy. This is why I have supported the proposal.

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon lists foreign direct investment among the matters pertaining to common commercial policy. Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has exclusive competence in this matter. Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have maintained a significant number of agreements with third countries on foreign direct investment. If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter. The adoption of measures to substitute the existing agreements is the only way to ensure a high degree of protection for investors and to ensure that their rights are recognised and guaranteed by the legal certainty of such agreements. The draft certainly moves along these lines and I have therefore voted in its favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The Internal Market is without doubt the most important instrument that the European Union has to foster growth in the wake in the recent financial crisis. The millions of citizens and businesses that reap the benefits of the Internal Market must be able to exercise their rights and be able to travel, work and live freely anywhere in Europe. This is why they must also have access to effective remedies if they intend to make a claim against another citizen or business that endangers these rights. Today, the European Union has instruments in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts. However, the actual right to have judgments enforced is still lacking. Establishing an effective system for the freezing and disclosure of debtors’ assets, and stepping up cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States, are the best ways of filling these gaps. That is why I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy’s report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 325 obliges the Commission and Member States to protect the financial interests of the European Union and to combat fraud in areas where this responsibility is shared between the Union and the Member States. According to Article 325(5), the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council an annual report on measures taken for the implementation of this Article. I agree that we need to quantify in greater detail the recovery levels of funds unduly paid to the EU Member States by gathering specific data. Another important point, rightly highlighted by Mrs Ivan in her report, is the use of better investigative methods regarding fraud carried out by Member States. In this way, we can standardise counter measures throughout the European Union and determine whether similar types of fraud have been committed in other countries. This is why I have supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Single Market is a valuable tool for economic recovery in the European Union, particularly for the creation of new jobs. The reports regarding the Act for the Single Market are, generally speaking, contributions made by the European Parliament in the consultation process begun by the Commission with its announcement ‘Towards a Single Market Act. Fifty Proposals for improving our work, enterprises and dealings together for a highly competitive social market economy’. I think we should have put more emphasis on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, and the stimulation of innovation and competitiveness by the lifting of bureaucratic, administrative and regulatory burdens. However, I agree with the general structure of the report and, in particular, with the measures mentioned which aim to strengthen e-commerce and the simplification of the procurement system.

 The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna was struck by a series of devastating earthquakes. Italy then applied for mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The EUSF was set up precisely to provide help for European citizens affected by natural disasters. I therefore voted in favour of this report to ensure that the fund would serve the purpose for which it was created. This will allow Emilia-Romagna to recover both economically and socially. The region is in real need of external assistance and I am sure that any assistance that is released will be well spent. Within a few weeks, EUR 670 million will be released in assistance to the region, and the money will be used to finance rebuilding of the electricity network and infrastructure. This is certainly an important step towards relaunching the local economy, which in turn has always played a crucial role in Italian industry.

 I voted in favour of Ms Tzavela’s report and reject the call for a moratorium. I think we should recognise the potential effects of developing the use of shale oil and gas in the European Union. Energy resources constitute a source of wealth that must be utilised and are also key for making Europe a major power in the energy field and strengthening its independence. The Member States need additional sources of energy in order to free themselves from dependence on foreign energy supply. It is therefore essential to study a variety of energy sources, including shale gas. Although this is not the only solution to our energy needs, it would bring considerable benefits. The experience of the United States could be taken as a model: there shale gas has had a notable impact, causing gas prices to fall to levels much lower than in Europe. However I believe that a cautious approach should be taken since extraction of shale gas involves possible environmental risks. We must have a clear vision of the situation, weighing up the factors for and against, and above all ensuring adequate controls. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I think that the two Commissioners here should be able to answer all of our questions on the policies they are pursuing and the choices they are making. In this context, I would like to ask Commissioner Tajani whether the work he has done up to now might, as a first stage, finish up with the Commission’s role being strengthened at European level as regards industrial policy, because this is something we would really like to see.

Of course I believe that it would be worthwhile in the current situation to revitalise the Competitiveness Council, and secondly I think that a working group should be set up within the Commission to work with Commissioner Almunia on the one hand and the Commissioner for trade on the other. While the problem with Europe’s industry is definitely a problem with Europe’s industry, at the same time it is also a problem with the rules of the internal market and with policy on external relations not being sufficiently vigilant so that all kinds of goods arrive in Europe that do not comply with our rules.

 The purpose of the proposed legislation concerning the marketing and use of explosives precursors is to restrict access by members of the public to fifteen substances in high concentrations, which are dangerous because they can be used to make homemade explosives. I therefore voted in favour of Mr Mulder’s report, because I believe it could help to prevent potential terrorist attacks and consequently is a very important step to guarantee citizens’ safety. I think it is important, in the case of some categories of substance, for public access to be authorised by setting up a licence system harmonised at European level, and for other categories I think this access needs to be accompanied by reporting and traceability of suspicious transactions.

 The consequences of the current economic and financial crisis will drag on for a long time yet, having a negative effect on the European economy, the employment rate, public savings and social investments in Europe.

I support this report, which I see as a very important step forward.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have had a good debate today in Parliament on the issues of industry, growth and employment, which, as the Commissioner pointed out just now, began this morning with the plenary debate with Commissioners Tajani and Andor and has effectively continued, because we talked about energy for a long time, addressing the problems faced by the automotive industry. We will now continue with a question I submitted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which will be discussed here this evening. We were given assurances that in December we would have a solution to this problem, and I believe that everything we voted on yesterday at the start of the session reinforces the attention Europe is paying to this issue. There is no doubt that a host of industrial activities are linked to the European steel industry: on the one hand, upstream, the steel, iron, cast iron and iron alloy industry, and on the other, downstream, all of the industries that use these products, particularly the automotive, mechanical engineering, building, piping and metal goods sectors, as well as maritime and naval shipbuilding, domestic appliances, chemicals and other sectors. To maintain an active and competitive steel industry is vital for the future of Europe and its citizens. Even by early 2000, Europe had already lost its supremacy, beaten by China to the top spot. In recent years, the European Union has chosen to invest heavily in environmental issues – and that is a choice we approve of – but this has doubtless led to rising costs in this sector, together with an increase in commodity prices and rocketing energy costs – let us not forget that in Europe, electricity costs 100 % more than in the United States – and for some Member States, higher borrowing costs. In 2007, European steel production reached an all-time high, with 406 000 workers directly employed in the sector and in related activities. During the period 2007-2011, we saw a 10.6 % fall in employment, and today the industry employs 363 000 workers. These are rather discouraging figures, particularly for 2012. The most worrying figure is the sharp decline in production in sectors closely linked to steel; in other words, automotive and construction, which last year alone recorded a fall in production of 3.2 %. Non-European imports are steadily rising. The administrative burden that European manufacturers must bear is high and gives rise to additional costs that reduce our capacity for investment in innovation and research, at times even resulting in relocation. Perhaps we should ask ourselves if, alongside the new strategy for industrial policy that the Commission has recently adopted, there is a need for sector policies, which seek to intervene on a case-by-case basis to reverse damaging trends that Europe can no longer afford. We know that the Commission is working on an action plan for the steel industry: what stage is this at? Having welcomed the CARS 2020 Action Plan, we would also like to see an operational plan for the steel industry that can be implemented immediately. It is perhaps worth considering whether policies could be introduced that would fully enable our strategic companies to respond to global competition. To be innovative, we should imagine the re-industrialisation of Europe being accompanied by a set of policies that need our support, such as research and innovation, which is an essential tool. However, I would also like to mention the need for a review of competition policy, which was drawn up in the 1990s and perhaps does not take into account the need for Europe’s economy to deal with a global market and global competition. The completion of the internal market is essential in order to bring down the cost of energy and special attention must be given to trade agreements with third countries. To conclude, we should perhaps also ask ourselves whether it is worth reinstating a Council dedicated solely to industry, returning to the situation prior to 2002. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of us in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have submitted a question for oral answer to this Parliament, to be dealt with tomorrow afternoon. The motion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was approved unanimously, by 44 members out of the 44 who were present, and on this occasion it became clear that it would be beneficial to seek a resolution. I know that the Bureau has decided in the first instance not to accept our motion. Mr President, I would like to ask this Chamber and you if we could review this position, since we believe that Europe is currently going through extremely difficult times in many sectors, but particularly in steel and steelmaking, given that jobs in this sector fell by 10.6 % during 2011 and, indeed, there is talk of another reduction by 10.4 % this year. For this reason, I think it would be beneficial to everyone to send a signal to the Commission and to Europe if, after tomorrow’s debate, we could already think of passing a resolution in December.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been the compromise possible today to clarify the issue of energy efficiency, which, until now, has remained the Cinderella figure of the climate and energy package. I thank all those who worked to achieve this result which – I repeat – is the only compromise possible today. It is now up to the Member States to respond accordingly by taking action on public buildings and cutting red tape to raise public awareness. I am glad that the Commissioner reaffirmed the commitment to present the report by 2014, because that will allow us to assess the results already achieved and to propose any new guidelines, which are certainly necessary.

 We are facing an historic moment in which migration flows are mixed and we have to deal with asylum applications by land and by sea. I voted in favour of the report on enhanced solidarity in the field of asylum as it is a concrete commitment to guarantee suitable and effective asylum policies. The report outlines better harmonisation of protection and asylum standards and increased solidarity between Member States, which is to say, mutual assistance and responsibility sharing between Member States in order to ensure rights are promoted and respected. I agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur: practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity, and I also believe it is necessary to make use of the complementarity of EU funds.

 The new regulation on European standardisation is a satisfactory compromise reached after a year of tough negotiations. I believe that standardisation is a key step on the road to achieving the objectives outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy and to boosting the internal market. This regulation will help European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity within a constantly updated system, products will be safer, services faster and costs lower. All this is advantageous, particularly for previously under-represented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will now be better represented and which will now incur lower costs and fewer burdens in general. The regulation does include among its objectives the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and increased transparency, as well as consumer and environmental protection. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

In December 2010, Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 were adopted, calling for a review of EU rules governing pharmacovigilance, which applied in July 2012. While the new legislation did strengthen pharmacovigilance at EU level, there are some potential weaknesses in the system in the texts on this issue that still need to be addressed. I voted in favour of the report on pharmacovigilance as it ensures stronger surveillance on the use of medicines and refines the system with regard to disclosure and notification of information to stakeholders. The legal framework is thereby now strengthened, ensuring higher levels of transparency and safety. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The issue of growth, especially in this historic period where Europe is going through a period of economic and financial crisis, is amongst the priorities on Europe’s agenda. ‘Europe 2020’ includes measures aimed at achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. To achieve the objectives set out in this strategy and to help the market unleash its full potential, modern and efficient infrastructure (in the field of transport and energy) throughout Europe is of key importance. This is exactly why I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report. It focuses on project bonds which, in addition to equity instruments and grants, help to finance new projects and obtain more private investment. For 2010-2020, EUR 1.5 trillion will be needed to build infrastructure, whereas the figure allocated in the text is EUR 230 million. There is still a lot of work to be done, but in this situation, Mr Färm’s report is a step in the right direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Within the context of the process of European integration, the creation of a single railway area is of fundamental importance. One need only recall the fact that one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based is the free movement of persons throughout the territory of the EU. For this reason, I have wholeheartedly supported Ms Serracchiani’s recommendation. There are two aspects within it which I would like to emphasise. The first relates to the creation of a network of fully independent national regulators with greater powers, coordinated by the Commission, with the possibility, in the future, of establishing a single European regulator. The second concerns the change of duration of the contract between Member State and infrastructure manager from three to five years. This change will make it possible to have better medium- and long-term guarantees for investment plans. A single railway area will permit non-discriminatory access to the market and will make our railway network stronger, healthier and more competitive. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Roads are currently the main mode of transport within the European Union, for both passengers and freight. Freight transport by road accounts for more than two-thirds of the total tonnage. It is for that reason that I decided to vote for and support the report by Ms Ţicău, to amend the regulation on recording equipment in road transport. Tachographs have a concrete impact on the daily lives of drivers, and because of that it is vitally important to make them more efficient in order to improve road safety, drivers’ working conditions and to ensure fair competition among transport companies. Improving safety on Europe’s roads is a duty which the European Union cannot ignore. The establishment of statutory obligations for manufacturers of tachographs, authorities, transport operators and drivers, as contained in the report, does precisely this. These aspects, together with the introduction of the latest technologies, make the report an excellent point of departure for raising the level of safety on our roads. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The safety of EU citizens is one of the European Union’s main concerns. In addition to negative effects caused by failure to respect intellectual property rights having an impact on Europe’s economy, counterfeiting and piracy cost European businesses nearly EUR 250 billion annually, and damage and jeopardise the health and safety of the residents of the EU’s 27 states. I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann because it deals precisely and clearly with an extremely important issue, by seeking to simplify the regulatory framework that currently exists, so as to make measures to combat counterfeiting more effective and rigorous. Consumer protection, facilitation of the work of customs authorities, protection of intellectual property rights and combating fraud are the keystones on which European policy in this sector must rest. We will only be able to achieve protection of the health and defence of European citizens and the EU economy through vigorous and decisive protection of intellectual property rights, and this report is an important step towards attaining this goal.

 Road safety is a subject of enormous importance, especially nowadays, when technology and developments in the automotive sector are reaching ever higher levels. The EU’s task is to adopt legislation that will enable citizens to travel on safe roads and in safe vehicles. That is why I voted for the resolution moved by Mr Koch and Ms Sehnalová on the adoption of the eCall system in all cars by 2015. The introduction of this device will bring many benefits. In the event of a serious accident, a vehicle equipped with eCall will automatically place a 112 emergency call, even if the passenger is not in a fit state to speak, and provide the emergency services with all the key information on the accident. Thanks to the use of this technology, about 2 500 lives will be saved every year and the severity of injuries sustained will fall by 10-15%, all due to the swifter and more efficient intervention of the rescue services at the scene of the accident.

 This proposal for a regulation is intended to overhaul the provisions on foodstuffs for specific nutritional uses, contained in the Framework Directive on Dietetic Products, which makes substantial reference to the 1979 standard. The proposal intends to abolish the concept of dietetic foods and set out a new framework containing general provisions for a limited number of well-defined categories of foods judged essential for some particularly vulnerable sections of the population, for example foods aimed at infants and children and foods to be used under medical supervision. Vulnerable people need greater protection than the rest of the population and must be able to benefit from a high level of legal certainty. The proposal also suggests creating a single legal act that regulates the list of substances that can be added to the food categories that are the subject of this proposal. The differences in how Member States implement the existing legislation are currently too large, causing market distortions and administrative burdens. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The EU-Latin America partnership has always been very strong, both from a cultural and a commercial standpoint. Indeed, the Union is the principal donor of development aid and the principal investor in the area. I voted in favour of the report on development cooperation with Latin America since it clearly and accurately addresses topics important to future collaboration between the EU and Latin America. At this time of economic crisis, we must enhance current EU-Latin America relations. The food crisis, the fight against climate change and social problems are challenges common to both of these areas. A positive resolution of the above issues will largely depend on the cooperation relationship that will be established in the coming years. Multilateralism and enhanced cooperation are two paths that we must embark upon with determination. Cooperating and collaborating with Latin America, by sending targeted aid, tailored to the situation and to the specific needs of each State, does not mean simply aiming to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This cooperation will also help eradicate poverty and inequality and boost economic development of the area. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted for the report on cross-border voluntary activities, which was tabled on the eve of the closure of the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. I believe it fills the existing regulatory gap and marks a step forward in relation to the current situation. The report sets out much-needed objectives, such as removing barriers to volunteers and thus allowing them greater and easier movement, and increasing volunteers’ knowledge in areas such as cultural heritage, sport and health. Voluntary work, which accounts for 5% of Europe’s GDP, improves the quality of people’s lives, provides considerable added value and adds to the training of young people, who can then look forward to a better career. There are currently 100 million European citizens working in voluntary activities; this is a fundamental expression of active citizenship and an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth. Voluntary work does entail costs, however, even though it is not paid, and there is therefore a need for tax exemption. Mr Scurria’s report promotes high-quality volunteering within and across national borders, and puts forward important proposals, such as creating a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and introducing a European Skills Passport.

 The Internet is the primary information tool used by millions of people around the world every day. Its strategic significance means that the European Union should pay particular attention to it, and regulation and protection of the Internet from external attacks are subjects of extreme importance. All the countries of Europe, in conjunction with private businesses, need to make a coordinated effort to try to contain and neutralise any cyber attacks. I voted in favour of Mr Kalfin’s report because a large number of European citizens and businesses are at risk of cyber attacks every day. The report proposes effective solutions to the problem. One such solution would be to implement a global plan whereby the interaction of the governments, businesses and individuals involved would prevent cyber attacks from happening and render the Internet more secure and protected. Information security is key to European security. Europe cannot, and must not, forego the need to protect user data and intellectual property. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The subject of energy security is vitally important in the policies of the European Union. The EU spends over EUR 400 billion on energy imports every year, and so its dependence on third countries is self-evident. Coordinating the Member States; diversifying energy suppliers, routes and sources; extending Europe’s sphere of influence beyond its borders; sharing information on energy data and projects in third countries; and developing partnerships with suppliers and international organisations are the key points on which the new European energy policy should be based. If we put these guidelines into practice alongside everything the European Union is doing in terms of energy efficiency and developing new forms of energy, we will be in a position to achieve a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy. Much remains to be done before we have a proper common energy policy, but there is no doubt that Parliament intends to move firmly in that direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The global economic crisis remains a concern for the European institutions and EU citizens. The creation of a financial transaction tax (FTT) has some significant aspects for the EU’s budget. I voted for the report by Ms Podimata because it stresses once again the constant attention being paid by the European Union to the effects of the crisis. In addition, its implementation will make it possible to generate more fiscal revenue for the European Union’s budget: approximately EUR 57 billion (two thirds of the total revenue of the FTT). It should be emphasised that the FTT needs to be applied globally, not merely at European Union level; otherwise, there would be a risk that financial entities would migrate to markets outside the EU, thus weakening the European market.

The report by Ms Sarnez is very important and topical at this time of global economic crisis. I voted for the report by my fellow Member because it sets out effectively and precisely an overview of the most sensitive and significant issues in relations between the European Union and China. Aspects such as reciprocity, the protection of intellectual property rights, transparent rules, the resolution of the trade imbalance and the formulation of rules to create a system of competition that is fair, honest and founded on a level playing field are all issues of great importance for European industry as a whole. In view of the very important part now played by the Chinese market for our enterprises, this report is a clear signal to the European institutions, with the intention that these issues should be tackled as swiftly as possible so that European enterprises may enter the Chinese market and thus take advantage of the many investment possibilities it offers.

 This own-initiative report welcomes the work carried out in order to establish a European Union internal security strategy. By virtue of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is actually entitled to take the lead on this issue, setting priorities and defining the future internal security model. I consider the work carried out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and by Ms Borsellino, to be significant. The key areas of European intervention are highlighted here and the primary objective seems to be that of achieving greater cooperation among the Member States’ courts and police, in order to tackle the threats arising from organised crime, terrorism, corruption, cybercrime and also natural disasters. I fully agree with the intention to create a common European area of freedom, security and justice and to adopt a unified strategy for all Member States. I believe that there is a great need to step up efforts in order to improve the consistency of the information and data which is used to assess the risks borne by EU bodies and to guarantee transparency in the methods used, thereby achieving the basic purpose of ensuring full protection of citizens.

The report by Mr de Jong stresses that in order to guarantee coherent and high-quality European legislation on criminal law, the three institutions must reach an agreement on principles and working methods. I am in agreement with this own-initiative report due to the serious approach that was taken in regulating such a delicate policy area. In particular, I agree with the importance given to mutual recognition, harmonisation of protection standards and the principle of the presumption of innocence. I support the creation of a common European legal culture and of a uniform and coherent strategy as well as the promotion of greater institutional coordination, while ensuring that the main areas of criminal law remain the responsibility of the Member States. The law must be extremely clear and easy to understand, which is why I agree that the European Commission should appoint a specific coordinating authority. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I welcome the report by Ms Irigoyen Pérez, which aims to ensure equal treatment and the elimination of discrimination in the internal market and, in particular, protection of the most vulnerable consumers. This is to be achieved through a targeted strategy which consists of promoting programmes to support consumer information and education, uniform application of standards in all Member States and transparent pricing, especially with regard to e
-commerce. We also need stricter rules on advertising, which is misleading at times, and a greater control over the information given to the public in order to avoid buyers making ill-informed choices. Consumers need to be better protected when buying and they must be carefully looked after, by creating legislation on adequate, clear and precise information, which will help achieve a more transparent and competitive single market.

 Turkey is a candidate country for accession to the European Union, and is therefore bound to observe the Community acquis
 and to commit to respecting human rights, including the rights of women and gender equality, one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, these rights are not always respected in Turkey, a country where violence against women continues to occur day after day. I believe that there is a definite need for a change of course, a transformation of the patriarchal structure of Turkish society and culture. This report calls on the Turkish Government to take concerted and coordinated action to implement legislative measures on women’s rights, their education and participation in politics. Turkey does not do enough to protect women. There are still countless cases of forced or early marriages. Development of better education for all is essential when it comes to fundamental rights.

 The ITER project has a particular importance within the programme for a greener, more sustainable Europe, a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy. I fully agree with the content of Ms Balzani’s report and believe that the project to build a power plant in the south of France will help produce clean energy on a large scale, without releasing harmful and polluting emissions into the environment. The additional financing for 2012-2013 confirms Parliament’s desire to support a project that is very ambitious, much discussed, but also extremely important when it comes to striving for excellence in a sector in which the EU can take a leading role.

 Education is a fundamental aspect that must be taken into account in the process of growth, development and prosperity for the Europe of the future. I voted for Mr Tőkés’s report since I fully agree with the practical measures set out in this text that aim to modernise higher education systems in Europe. Highly skilled workers will be needed in 35% of all jobs by 2020. Actions such as widening access to higher education, the Erasmus Master’s Degree Mobility Scheme and loans for students who want to study for a Master’s degree abroad will help the national governments in this delicate process in the interest of future generations.

 The recent financial crisis has affected many EU Member States, some of which have been hit harder than others. I voted for the report by Ms Hübner and I fully support the guidelines of the text, the primary objective of which is to help and support Member States in difficulty. The above measures are crucially important in the present crisis. They will allow the implementation of important infrastructure projects of fundamental importance for Member State revenues and for maintaining jobs. In this way, the EU can guarantee its support to Member States that are in difficulty, ensure that its aid is not lost, and provide guarantees to Member States that are net contributors.

 The European Union and the United States are together in the front line of the fight against international terrorism. Close cooperation between these two political entities is a requirement for reducing any kind of threat to a minimum. The agreement reached in 2007 is an initial step towards the end goal and now the agreement signed in November 2011 introduces important new provisions, including more efficient exchanges of information and greater protection for passenger data. I voted in favour of the agreement because it will shore up the fight against various criminal activities, aid in the capture of those guilty of terrorist acts, strengthen the transatlantic partnership and ensure that passengers’ privacy and personal details are protected.

 I think we need to start simplifying and harmonising taxes across the various Member States. Having 27 different sets of rules carries a number of disadvantages: high costs and administrative burdens, social and economic distortions, risks of discrimination and, lastly, an increase in opportunities for tax evasion. That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, who see their sovereignty over tax issues being threatened, I have voted in favour of Ms Thyssen’s report on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. Indeed, I am very much convinced that all Member States need to comply with the same rules if the single market project is to be completed. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report on the taxation of energy products and electricity because I completely agree with its basic principles: aligning provisions on energy taxation with the environmental goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and reducing distortions in the internal market between EU Member States. Indeed, the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity needs to be as coherent as possible with the EU’s environmental goals. The political groups cannot reach an agreement on proportionality. I was especially supportive of Amendment 53, which aims to rid the proposal of the principle of proportionality, primarily for pragmatic reasons. We cannot allow further increases in diesel prices at a time when, for fiscal reasons due to austerity measures, the prices of energy products are under constant pressure. Furthermore, diesel is often used for work purposes and it is obvious that road haulage would suffer major negative effects as a result of regulated minimum rate increases. Lastly, the people of Europe would not be able to comprehend such a decision. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I support Mr Cabrnoch’s report on the coordination of social security systems because I believe that a revision, an update and a clarification of the social security conditions in the various EU Member States were absolutely necessary. These are historic times, in which cross-border mobility has become an increasingly significant phenomenon and we really need coordination in this field in order to ensure security for our citizens and their future, and, of course, legal certainty for those concerned. I therefore support the need to develop standard solutions so as to prevent discrimination from arising among EU citizens. Elisabetta Gardini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Parliament’s approval, from now on, the concept of ‘righteous’, which has always been applied to those who saved Jews from the ‘final solution’, will be the heritage of all of humanity. There have been objections from those who do not recognise Soviet communism as totalitarianism and who refuse to compare the lager
 to the gulag
, from those who prefer to ignore the massacre of the Armenians so as not to prejudice relations with Turkey, from those who think that comparing the shoah
 with other horrors of the 20th century by an extended and generalised use of the word ‘righteous’ makes it banal, and finally from those who have criticised the exclusion or inclusion of this or that example of genocide or massacre. The European Parliament has overcome these and other objections and, from now on, men and women who were brave enough, and sometimes lost their lives, opposing the abuse of tyrants of any ideology or political leaning will be recognised as heroes of human dignity and heroes in the building of the moral identity of the European people.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of European foreign and security policy is especially crucial at this particular historic juncture, which is marked by an extraordinary wave of protest that has taken hold in the Mediterranean and is also spreading across the Middle East. In view of this serious crisis affecting the whole of the southern Mediterranean and now spreading into the Arabian Peninsula, the European Parliament must act as a sounding board for all these protests by ordinary people. They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes. This House wants to deal directly with the High Representative and Vice-President, Baroness Ashton, particularly because of our role in controlling the budgets of civilian and military missions under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP). The first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions, primarily the Council and the Commission, driven by the post-Lisbon approach to European politics. Another very important subject is the EU’s multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being. In this regard, I have to welcome the recent resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly granting the European Union observer status within the Security Council, thus acknowledging what the Treaty of Lisbon enshrines. We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible. The report rightly highlights the great wave of civil protest in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and also in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, and points out events, contexts and expectations for each of these countries, as well as other subjects of particular interest, such as our strong transatlantic alliance and our hugely important relations with Russia. Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during a hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a Member asked the High Representative/Vice-President a loaded question. He said that, when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States’ isolationist stance, particularly in relation to the European Union, he replied ‘There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe’. The Member then asked Baroness Ashton, ‘Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now?’ Her very British answer was: ‘Yes, I do that job, although I am called High Representative/Vice-President and not foreign minister. There is also a phone number, but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position, 2 for the French, 3 for the German, and so on’. Baroness Ashton, you have heard the speeches by many of my fellow Members, and this message is also in my report. You have a number of voices in the world, but you listen to ours – Parliament’s – more because we always support a European policy, and not just that of the Member States, to which you reply in the Council, or that of the Commission, to which you reply in the appropriate places. I would like there to be a third place in which you could express your third loyalty. This place is in the middle of this Chamber, behind the podium, because you are the Council, the Commission and also Parliament. I believe this dialogue needs to be developed and strengthened in order to achieve democratic legitimacy for our external policy, directed and controlled by Europe’s citizens. We will help you carry out this role. Gabriele Albertini,

Mr President, I made a mistake when reading the text. We deleted the name ‘Macedonia’ in order to avoid trampling on some people’s sensibilities, including those, I believe, of the President. Therefore, only the expression ‘former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’ was used. We deleted the name ‘Macedonia’. Gabriele Albertini,

Mr President, please excuse me. I may be wrong, but I do not remember voting on the oral amendment to paragraph 68.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years after the start of negotiations between the European Commission and Pakistan, an agreement has finally been reached on a readmission procedure for persons residing in the European Union without authorisation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs asked permission to draft an opinion on this very important agreement, particularly bearing in mind developments in the region around Pakistan and the issue of human rights. We had a lengthy debate in committee and several concerns were raised: the unstable situation and continual violations of human rights in Pakistan, as well as the fact that negotiations held with Pakistan did not guarantee the rights and safety of persons sent back to Pakistan. Also, we were worried that no evaluation of the 11 readmission agreements already in force has yet been made. In the end, the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs concluded that a clear framework for cooperation on readmission with Pakistan was preferable to a situation where there is a risk that Member States proceed to expel illegal immigrants from Pakistan on an ad hoc basis and without supervision based on the respect for human rights. Article 16 will ensure that the EU can carry out this supervision, so I reiterate the request of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for an evaluation of the agreements concluded thus far and I support its adoption. Gabriele Albertini,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: ‘No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The prohibition applies in all situations and is an overriding rule of international law and, as such, applies to all states. Not only does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights impose this protection of human rights against torture but so do the United Nations Convention and the European Convention. The European Union and its Member States take these obligations very seriously. Considering also that we celebrated the International Day against Torture last week, we believe that combating torture constitutes an absolute priority for the European Union. To respect these extremely important legal and moral obligations, we therefore need to impose a close control on the trade in equipment designed to inflict torture or other inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. The moment when the regulation was adopted represented a great step forward, as was also confirmed by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on torture. This regulation also serves as a model in terms of international legislation on the subject. The application of this regulation has not, unfortunately, been as exemplary as its adoption: only seven Member States have submitted one or more of the annual public reports laid down in Article 13 of the regulation, containing detailed information on authorisations granted for the import and export of goods that could be used for torture. These reports constitute an essential element for assessing full compliance with the regulation. Numerous questions are raised over the final use and destination of the goods when we analyse the authorisations granted. Authorities with responsibility for authorising exports must therefore carry out a more detailed political assessment before proceeding. Neither have many Member States communicated information relating to penalties applicable for infringing the provisions of the Council Regulation, as required in Article 17 of the regulation. Nearly five years after the adoption of the regulation, the list of goods identified in the Annexes to the regulation must be updated. Man can be very cruel and sometimes it seems that the human imagination for ways of inflicting suffering on others is unlimited. It is therefore of fundamental importance to keep pace with technological developments in this cheerless arena. For all these reasons, the time has come to table the question to the European Parliament and to call on the European Union and its Member States to show that they are able to keep their promises. As members of the European Parliament, it is our duty, by democratic mandate, to ensure that the institutions work responsibly. This is the reason why we want detailed information on what has been done so far to comply fully with the regulation and also on measures that will enable the situation to be improved in the future. We welcome, as a first step, the decision of the Committee supervising the application of this regulation at the end of this month. Lest we forget, Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 is not merely fine words but a fundamental and essential instrument that must now be applied in full. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union needs to adopt a new approach and make a joint effort when facing global challenges. The powers recently obtained due to the entry into force of the treaty mean that Parliament engages in frequent, cooperative and effective discussions with our primary interlocutor, Baroness Ashton, who has the honour of acting as the new Vice-President/High Representative for the first time. Her mandate was subject to our consensus vote in January and, on several occasions, the Parliamentary Assembly was promised that the Council and the Commission would be constantly involved in all the most important aspects of European security and defence. As the report itself confirms, the High Representative is therefore called upon to appear before the European Parliament and to consult it frequently and regularly. With the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union’s external action takes on a new and important dimension, but actually achieving this goal also depends on the European Union having the necessary budgetary resources. The European Parliament has a key role to play in its capacity as custodian of the democratic legitimacy of external action. The creation of a European External Action Service will give a diplomatic body and system to the European Union which, until now, has only been able to rely on national representation. The roles of the official representatives, whose appointment is the responsibility of the High Representative, assume great relevance and topicality. Nonetheless, as stated in the report, Parliament is calling for greater powers of ballot and control over the roles and the mandates of individual representatives, upholding the principles of transparency and merit that must guide the High Representative when appointing candidates. It is hoped that we will eventually achieve a situation of double hatting – except in the case of the special representative, whose range of action should be regional – and that we will therefore benefit from economies of scale, making the European Union’s external action more efficient and, at the same time, less costly. After an initial introductory section on strategy, the report addresses the issue of European foreign policy by theme and geographical area. The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied, especially the United Nations, the chief custodian of global security. It must play an important role, not only from the viewpoint of its seat on the Security Council, but also in terms of staff and delegations connecting the two bodies. We call on the Vice-President/High Representative to let Europe fulfil its ambition to become an active, strategic and independent partner of a great ally such as the United States in order to respond to the global challenges of terrorism, finance, and the often fraught relationships with industrial giants such as Russia, China and Japan. The report continues with a geographical analysis of what we can hope to achieve. In the Balkans, the theme of enlargement is introduced: the report praises the gradual achievement of the stabilisation process in Kosovo, where the European Union is present with the EULEX mission, but efforts must still be made to ensure that accession standards are respected for many countries close to candidacy for accession – Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the chapter concerning cooperation with the East and the Black Sea regions, the report deals with the issue of the European Union’s energy supply security and dependency. In the section on Russia, it calls for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to be signed. As far as the South Caucasus is concerned, the report calls for the territory of Georgia and its ethnic minorities to be left intact, and for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria to be resolved Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the European Union must play a stronger political role in relaunching the peace process following the Council decision of 12 December 2009. Union for the Mediterranean: resolution of the Turkey-Cyprus conflict. Asia: Afghanistan, critical period for the establishment of a new government after the elections; Pakistan’s key role in the fight against terrorism; concern over the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. Africa: positive contribution of the Somali coast defence mission. Latin America: need to create a stable and enduring partnership for relationships between the European Union and Latin America. I will listen to my fellow Members’ comments with great interest and respond to them at the end. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

I thank my fellow Members, so many of whom have spoken, especially those who approved the key parts of the report, praising and endorsing its content, but also those who expressed criticisms and who, above all, did so in a desire to overcome the regrettably tragic instances where force has been used, and to dream of a peaceful world. A great Greek philosopher, Plato, said that only the dead will see an end to war. However, despite our refusal to bow to this philosophy and our attempts to prevent this happening, reality compels us to use force even on peace missions. I congratulate High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, and thank her for having mentioned my report: one aspect of her approach that I particularly like is its dual nature, the way it seeks synergy between the tasks of the Council and the Commission. Her very physical location – which will alternate between the benches of the Council, here, and the Commission – exemplifies her wish to wear two hats. As Parliament, I believe that we must support and promote this synergistic commitment. The European Commission pursues policies for development, neighbourhood, and for stability and the promotion of human rights and democracy; the Council undertakes peace missions and missions to implement the rule of law. This set of themes must find its ultimate expression in the European foreign diplomatic service, which must be efficient, effective, and equipped with the necessary skills and resources to be able to carry out its role as it should, and we will work hard to achieve this. I also thank the High Representative – and we will discuss this further on 23 April – for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of the external service, which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth. Today marks the beginning of our collaboration, but certainly not the end. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public opinion is divided on the Goldstone report. In particular, the Israeli armed forces are accused of having deliberately caused the deaths of countless civilians during the urban guerrilla operations. This is a very serious accusation, which appears to overlook certain undeniable facts, such as the distribution of leaflets throughout the battle zone to explain that houses containing weapons and munitions could be hit, and the telephone and radio warnings, including on Hamas frequencies, before attacks were launched on buildings identified as arms depots. The so-called ‘roof knocking’ technique was also used: if, after all those warnings, the air force still identified buildings full of people, small explosive and, above all, loud, charges would be launched to quickly evacuate the buildings. The Israeli army introduced warning signals for the Gaza civilians that no one else had put into practice before. Anyone who uses all these precautions cannot, under any circumstances, be accused of deliberately targeting civilians. Yesterday, on the same day, I met two major political figures: the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, in the morning, and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, in the evening. In both cases, the meeting was held in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and the hope expressed that, after too many decades of fighting, weapons will finally be abandoned in favour of a peace process. Just as both governments have also requested, Europe must maintain its balanced role as an impartial judge, sheltered from ideological positions that could only further inflame the feelings of both sides. Gabriele Albertini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Monday’s vote within the Committee on Foreign Affairs provided additional evidence of the complexity and, at the same time, of the benefit of extending the geographical and political borders of the Europe that we know today. Thanks to the work and efforts of my fellow rapporteurs and the contribution of individual political groups, we have achieved a text that expands on the original and has refined many aspects that were initially only mentioned in passing. The debate in committee and also within the groups themselves was not lacking in disagreements, sometimes lively, which are typical of an across-the-board confrontation that transcends the respective political positions. Historical events within each nation and the current state of their relations were at odds with applications made by candidate countries or aspiring candidates. In less than a year, another three applications were submitted to open membership negotiations: Montenegro in December 2008, Albania in April 2009 and Iceland in July 2009. It is a sign that the European project can still boast plenty of appeal and is considered a major factor of stability, particularly following the meltdown in financial markets. The text obtained as a result of the votes within the Committee on Foreign Affairs more forcefully underlines the need for the countries who wish to join the European Union to face up to this transition conscientiously, aware of the duties and implications that this process involves. Their entry requires them to respect European parameters, not only economic and political, but also cultural, social and legal, to ensure that the end result is more than the sum of its parts. I hope that the text that the plenary session will vote on tomorrow will address all aspects of the general strategy on enlargement in a more balanced and concise way. It will obviously benefit from the contribution of specific resolutions on each country. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE
),

The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us. I am grateful to Mr Brok and to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the excellent work they have done in spite of the little time available. On the basis of this work, the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service. The message that we want to send out to the Commission and the Council is basically this: we want a service that has extensive powers and which fulfils our ambitions of making the European Union a global political player, and we want this to happen on a consensual basis, that is to say, with the involvement and the support of all three institutions – Parliament, the Commission and the Council. I therefore urge the Commission to be courageous in the negotiations and to defend the Community model, and I invite the Council once again to involve this Parliament and, in particular, the committee that I chair, in the negotiations from the outset, in order to complete this crucial stage in the creation of a true European foreign policy. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Piebalgs. His statements just now confirm that South Stream is not Nabucco’s competitor but a further contribution to the diversification of Europe’s energy supply sources. Europe’s energy security is based on a variety of sources, routes and supply countries. At zero growth, future demand for gas is estimated at an additional 100 to 150 billion m3 
by 2020. Based on these assumptions the development of different options is imperative, and South Stream is not an alternative to Nabucco, but in fact complements it. The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco, South Stream and the Turkey-Greece-Italy interconnection (ITG). The anti-Russia debate is therefore in conflict with what we will see happening over the next few years. The European Parliament must call for pragmatism and above all consistency in the decisions that the European Union has essentially already taken: with the European economic recovery plan, with Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks, and with the second energy security strategy. The diversification of sources, routes and supply countries is the real pillar of Europe’s energy security policy and, leaving aside the political and economic interests of the various countries most directly involved, the South Stream-Nabucco challenge must be analysed with realism, not through the distorting prism of ideology but rather with a clear vision of what needs to be done. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, have to say that I had got a somewhat different impression of the conclusions of the summit from reading the newspapers from my own and other countries yesterday and the day before. This morning you, Mr Van Rompuy – and you more than Mr Barroso, in fact – have dashed those hopes and have cast doubt on a solution that had been touted in the papers and all the statements as a turning point, a new approach and a chance for Europe to rebuild and restore real confidence. I agree with Mr Barroso that it is a very important basic principle to make it clear in the various statements and in the final document that monetary stability in a modern economy can only lead to financial stability. Someone called it an historic statement; I see it as a basic premise to start from. If the state bailout fund gives the virtuous countries that have access to the fund the chance to recapitalise, then there is a real prospect, a real possibility. The term ‘possible’ dominates the final document; of course I join those who are laying a huge responsibility on your shoulders right now. In your reply, you must explain effectively and decisively whether the Member States can really put plans into action and be confident that it is not merely a general, abstract reversal of a trend that is not going well and is not enough for the markets. Everyone is said to be making do because we need to reach the end of the tunnel. I believe we are a very long way from the end of the tunnel and so, as regards putting plans into action, we had imagined that all the uncertainty of the previous year in Europe might be swept away by a real, effective decision to be reached at the Brussels Summit. Should we feel disappointed on this point? Should we wonder why it has not come true? Please tell us, Mr Van Rompuy, so we can avoid all these misunderstandings. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Swoboda for his solidarity with regard to the recent tragedies in Italy and especially for the significance he attached to the problems we are dealing with: civil harmony and the possibility that, through solidarity and the possibility of development, we can build a different Europe and a different civil society. It is clear to all of us that the debate conducted by Parliament in recent months on the intergovernmental agreement known as the fiscal compact has vindicated all political groups: I believe that the concerns we expressed have all come true. I am also sorry that the minister denies that there is a gap between austerity and development because I think that this dichotomy has hitherto paralysed our debate, as well as Europe’s development. The one-way monetary policy is not a development policy, just as a balanced budget is a bureaucratic, systematic element, but not forward-looking. The clash between austerity and development is not suited to the complexity and the needs of Europe – something we are all becoming aware of – because we are finding it difficult to move forward, which is perhaps the result of this deficiency and cultural poverty which always leads to an economic freeze. At the forthcoming summit, we must therefore develop a different policy, creating a political Europe as well as a fiscal Europe. While the Commissioner has stated he is ready for action, Parliament can only take him at his word. This is an important statement because to date, we have had to create the conditions, at least I interpret it that way, positively, even though others have taken different positions. However, we need finally to agree on a plan, a strategy able to create a political Europe, which is vital for a Europe of development. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at a time of crisis in Europe – because the debate in this House by all the groups regarding the agreement of 1 March has shown that the Community is in crisis – it is very significant that a country such as Serbia should be given the status of candidate for EU membership. I believe that it is a key moment, and I agree with the representatives of the Commission and of the Council, and with the rapporteur, that Serbia has taken many steps forward but must continue to solve problems and find uniformity with Europe. I believe this is a time of stability and a time of security for Europe and that the new relationship that Serbia is beginning to establish with Kosovo gives great hope not only to Italy, because its borders are closer, more adjacent, but also to all of Europe, which I believe has an interest in peace as a whole being guaranteed. I believe that we need to monitor behaviour, but I think all of us should be pleased about this rapprochement

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that today we have heard three speeches that bode well for Europe. They represent three programmes and three strategies. I would like to say to Ms Thorning-Schmidt that she has made a very important point, that Denmark follows Europe’s destiny. It is not just a throw-away line, it is a phrase that makes a commitment to strengthen Europe and to offer total support; to make sure, as she said at the end, that the Community method prevails. We therefore find ourselves in a very difficult situation – and mine is not empty rhetoric – as we are facing a halt in the EU development process. This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States. We have come to a standstill and are facing very difficult times, which I do not believe will lead to the possibility of development. With the intergovernmental agreement there is neither growth nor development. Therefore the commitment of the Danish Presidency is to prevent all this from happening. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel I need to express how I feel, which is both dismayed and concerned. I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose. We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other. There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament. Therefore I believe that we must do justice to this and take into account the fact that, as has been said, the Commission must guarantee the Treaties. The Commission therefore …  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I followed this morning’s debate and I have to say to the Polish President that what emerged showed far greater consensus than dissent. I personally belong to the group of people who expressed consensus and I would like to underline a very important part of the Polish President’s speech which yesterday provoked very lively discussion: You said, with regret, that the intergovernmental approach tends to take precedence over the European Community approach. The European Community has not seen the kind of development that we imagined for some years now, and the intergovernmental approach – as President Barroso clearly explained yesterday – paralyses the momentum which EU law would otherwise have achieved over the past few years. The prevalence of EU law is at odds with an intergovernmental approach which fails to give rise to that hope, that potential in Europe, which you, as President for the past six months, have helped to create. Taking everything into account, we do not think the summit had either negative or positive conclusions, but left us with questions which will find answers in March. I think your Presidency has somehow prevented the fall of Europe, and we hope things will continue to develop in that vein in the year ahead. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by Mr Casini, but in the committee meeting, I tabled various amendments in the – very modest, but I believe very correct – belief that they improved the text. Those amendments were not accepted because there was a discussion, which was also held at a high level, with you in attendance, and hence an agreement had already essentially been reached. I am tabling two oral amendments, one of which I consider to be very important because, as the Article states … I would like all the Members to listen to me for a moment, because I believe there is a problem … Two minutes … Do I have to speak later? May I continue?  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer both to this amendment and to the next one, because I have tabled two oral amendments. I believe that this one is very timely and integral to the overall text, because the Article spells out the duties of MEPs in the text, in the introduction, but it is very muddled and actually stipulates what cannot be done, not what MEPs must do in accordance with what Mr Casini said about our transparency and our representation of the people, whom we must represent in a correct and very scrupulous manner. I believe that it is very muddled. I would place even more emphasis on the other amendment, Mr President. Since we are stipulating that MEPs must not accept gifts worth more than EUR 150, my amendment, ladies and gentlemen, was far stricter in proposing a much lower amount, because I believe that MEPs should not accept any gifts or courtesies save for those of little, or negligible, value. I believe that the proof of this is in a letter received by all the MEPs. This letter provides for, offers MEPs EUR 100 to take part in a survey. I believe that this is an offence against …

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like us to recall what the European Union budget really is. The budget is not additional to national budgets, and to believe so would be to continue to conduct this debate on false premises, with the risk of fragmenting our efforts. The EU budget is synthetic and has the aim of multiplying the effects of the investments made by the individual Member States. It therefore creates more efficiency and effectiveness. Resources that are removed from the EU budget raise national public expenditure: this is the underlying principle on which he have built the Union. If the EU is seen as an additional entity to the Member States, just as the EU embassy in non-EU countries is additional to all of the national embassies, then we are misleading ourselves. Therefore to believe that by saving in the EU budget, we are contributing to general saving and austerity is an unpardonable error. Instead, what we manage to achieve with the EU budget is to allow individual states to make savings, to lower expenditure and encourage austerity. If we cannot acknowledge this fact – due to the sort of ‘soft’ nationalism every state has to show to its own public opinion – the result will be that we are constantly reducing the EU budget, which will always result in increases in the national budgets. In the end the individual Member States will spend the EUR 140 billion in any case, but with diminished efficiency, because the studies carried out by the Commission already show us that each euro yields 95 cents in the EU budget but only 50 cents in the national budgets.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I believe that things are a bit better, the impression after this Council is that a sort of ‘Penelope’s shroud’ principle is being applied and we are being asked to return again to matters that we thought had been concluded. I would therefore ask in regard to the single supervisory mechanism, which is certainly a good compromise, what the Commission intends to do to put pressure on the Member States pushing for its entry into force to be postponed. What is going to be done to ensure that they adopt more reasonable positions? As many wise leaders have observed, time is money. We must acknowledge that some countries want more time, but not enough attention is being paid to the fact that we seem to be postponing indefinitely the adoption, and the final implementation, of any decision. In other words, I believe that the results achieved by the Council should be viewed positively, but I also believe that all possible efforts should be made to ensure that these results take immediate effect.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good opportunity to have an objective discussion on Kazakhstan and the important agreement the country is negotiating with the EU. Kazakhstan is crucial for the stability and strategic future of Central Asia and is without doubt an important economic and trading partner for the EU. The country has already launched a process of economic and democratic reform, although much remains to be achieved in these areas. However, the country has shown itself to be committed to further and more far-reaching reforms and I think that the duty of the EU is to support this process. To this end, I am certain that the signing of this enhanced agreement will allow progress to be made, because it will strengthen an already solid and productive relationship and ensure constant assistance from the EU. I am also convinced – and I think that this should have been underlined more clearly in the report to be voted tomorrow – that greater progress in the areas of democracy and human rights should be met by renewed reciprocal efforts that are both open and constructive. Our aim should not be to place ourselves on a negative footing with this or that country if change is not achieved immediately, but rather to support the efforts by these countries to attain the objective of respect for the principle of human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation for the adoption of this report that, once again, draws the attention of the European Union to the protection of health and to the protection of citizens. With this report, we have, in fact, re-addressed the issue of surveillance of medicinal products, following the adoption of Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 amending the directives on pharmacovigilance. Since the so-called Mediator case, indeed, there has been a need to address the shortcomings identified by the tests conducted in this regard, and to refine the existing system, especially with regard to information requirements and notification of stakeholders and to the list of medicinal products subject to strengthened pharmacovigilance. The amendments introduced, although modest in their scope, complement and reinforce the legal framework outlined previously in favour of greater transparency and efficiency and improved product safety standards, thus benefiting the health of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Seeber’s report is Parliament’s contribution to the preparation of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, in which the Commission will be taking stock of what has been achieved since the Water Framework Directive, which has been one of the main pillars of European water policy since 2000. We voted for this report, which casts light on the challenges to be faced and the gaps to be filled, particularly in relation to the target of sustainability in terms of ecological, chemical and quantitative ‘good status’, which the framework directive says must be achieved by 2015. Among the measures suggested are the mainstreaming of water issues in all EU policy areas; the development of a holistic approach that examines all water uses and their implications; promotion and support for efficiency and sustainability in the management of this basic asset; and the achievement of water supply security, not only regionally but also internationally.

 The proposal for a regulation in question, updating Directive 2009/39/EC in line with legal and market developments, has raised questions over the classification of many products as ‘dietetic’, establishing general provisions for only a limited number of food categories considered essential for certain vulnerable population groups – foods aimed at infants, children and patients under medical supervision. At the same time it has shifted protection for other groups (coeliacs and people who are lactose-intolerant) to other EU legislation and mechanisms. The positive vote on Ms Ries’s report – the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – is a clear sign and a positive starting point for the coming negotiations. On one hand, it expresses the shared wish to simplify the regulations; on the other it draws attention to the need to reintroduce in the future regulation complete protection for the specific nutritional needs of all the most vulnerable groups of consumers.

 The violent flooding which hit Liguria and Tuscany in October 2011 severely damaged infrastructure, transport networks, businesses, agriculture and residential homes. Faced with this disaster, Italy requested mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, established in 2002 precisely to provide assistance to disaster-stricken regions. Our vote in favour of Mr Fernandes’s report will enable the fund to be mobilised – for the first time this year – for a total amount of EUR 18 061 682 for the Italian regions concerned. The importance of all this will be two-fold: as practical assistance with physical reconstruction, and as a symbolic gesture that will remind all Europeans of the value of solidarity, one of the cornerstones on which the European Union is founded.

 Mr President, Ms Irigoyen Pérez’s report, which we have voted to support, concerns the need to consider developing a strategy to protect the rights of the most vulnerable consumers, in light of the strategy that the European Commission and the Member States will be required to devise to that end. Consumers may be vulnerable for various reasons, and potentially anyone may be affected. That is why this group of consumers, along with consumers in general, needs to be protected. A targeted strategy is required that considers the problem in the round while, on the one hand, avoiding creating new forms of discrimination and, on the other, eschewing static, rigid definitions that are unable to embrace all the facets of the matter and the various possible kinds of vulnerability. Specific, targeted protective measures are therefore needed. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Søvndal for his thorough description. First of all, I, too, would like to express our total support to the families of the victims of the serious clashes that took place on 16 December in Zhanaozen, and our concern for the subsequent unfolding of events. What was initially essentially a labour dispute degenerated into extremely serious incidents in which 17 people lost their lives and, in the days following the incident, led to the arrest of journalists and representatives of the opposition. It is in everyone’s interest, as Kazakhstan has done, to shed full light on the events and I therefore hope that today will be remembered solely as an opportunity for our Parliament to explore what has happened thus far, and to reiterate our call for an investigation that will reassure the international community that the responsibilities for the events of Zhanaozen will be clarified and those responsible pursued in the utmost respect of the principles of the law and respect for human rights. The delegation that I have the honour of heading has had the opportunity of hearing the explanations provided by the Kazakh authorities at some of its meetings, as well as those of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are very active in monitoring events in the country. The willingness of the authorities of Kazakhstan to provide explanations and the promise to provide further clarifications are undoubtedly positive elements and should be appreciated by us all. This is another reason why I would like to underline the need to maintain a certain balance, which I would have liked to have seen play a bigger part also in the text of the resolution on which we will have to vote tomorrow, and which, in my opinion, it would perhaps have been better to have postponed until the official investigations were over. It would also have been useful to send an official mission of international bodies to flank the investigations. The undeniable need to further clarify what happened and to call for greater efforts on the part of Kazakhstan in improving its progress along the road to democracy must also be accompanied at all times by a new commitment to an open and constructive dialogue with the country.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at such a difficult time for Europe and after the blocking of the proposal at the Council and the tabling of a new amended Commission proposal, the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union is undoubtedly a positive act. It is a useful compromise that has resolved many of the issues that caused the impasse
, such as the full financing of the scheme by the European Union, with the participation of the Union in the distribution point programme, an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million for the Union’s financial contribution, the notion of the Union origin of the foods that are then distributed and the requirement for the purchase of food products to be made on the basis of competitive procedures. The scheme will therefore be operational from 2013 and will allow the supply of food products from reserves deriving from intervention in order to benefit the most deprived persons in the Union, thus also achieving one of the most important objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Today’s vote in favour is the culmination of this report’s complex and difficult path, and is an important sign of the Union’s support for its most deprived citizens. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the increase in intellectual property infringements observed in recent years threatens to undermine the strategy on intellectual property rights in the single market that was launched by the Commission in May 2011. To combat such infringements and ensure the success of the intellectual property protection policy, it has been proposed that the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market be entrusted with certain tasks relating to the running of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, set up in 2009. The purpose of this is to provide the Observatory with the human and financial resources to combat intellectual property infringements and to conduct campaigns to raise public awareness of the risks of buying counterfeit products. Our adoption of the report therefore marks a very important moment in the fight against the trade in counterfeit goods and in defence of innovation, growth and the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the jobs and security of the people of Europe.

 Four years after it was first introduced, the European Parliament is examining the status of implementation of the EU strategy for Central Asia. In the light of major developments in Europe and the world, the EU has summed up its achievements in its relations with this part of the world. This report underlines the need for a new approach focusing on strengthening long-term cooperation and a mutual strategic commitment in order to deepen the political, social and economic relations. The text also highlights the need to maintain a high level of commitment in all areas of society, thanks also to more financial resources, funding and programmes. Furthermore, the report draws attention to the institutional value of the partnership and cooperation agreements (PCAs) as the basis for exchanges with these countries and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committees as tools that can guarantee a regular platform for strengthening bilateral relations with countries in Central Asia. To sum up, the new strategy has a fundamental role in the creation of increasingly stable cooperation with this sensitive region, with which dialogue and the mutual exchange of knowledge will guarantee ambitious results in terms of economic cooperation, the promotion of development and defence of human, social and cultural rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenges posed by the modern age and by Mr Triantaphyllides’s report, for which we have voted in favour, dictate that citizens in their capacity as consumers should be placed at the centre of the EU debate, and they remind us that the safeguarding of citizens’ interests cannot remain a principle sanctified at the level of treaties, but should be a concrete and inspiring principle of EU politics. Protected and informed consumers, who are made more aware and are therefore in a position to take full advantage of the instruments and resources at their disposal, as well as to make full use of their rights, should be the final aim of the EU’s new strategy on consumer policy. This strategy should therefore be established as an approach with ample breathing space, and it should be all-encompassing, so that it can move freely from the sector of financial services to that of food, from the safeguarding of minors to advertising, and, therefore, be in a position to make an important contribution to Europe’s social and environmental objectives.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme, for which we voted in favour, is based on a measured, realistic approach which, on the one hand, has refrained from laying down impractical requirements that are impossible to meet, and on the other, has provided for a so-called flexibility scheme. By laying down stages and corresponding quantitative limits of permitted emissions, this scheme provides for the placing on the market of a pre-established annual quota of tractors meeting certain characteristics, and thereby enables the manufacturing and industrial sectors concerned to adapt to the pre-established standards gradually, without causing them disruption. Mr Tatarella has produced an important piece of work and has managed to strike a careful balance between the requirements arising from the major challenges which the EU needs to tackle at this time, and the requirements relating to environmental protection and the present economic crisis.

 Mr President, in recent years, the current global economic crisis, which is even worse than the Great Depression, has caused unsustainable imbalances in international economies. The commercial disparities between countries, financial markets lacking common rules, and the instability of the banking system all constitute a potential threat to financial and economic stability. This resolution, which I support, stresses the urgent need for total reform, with new rules and global economic coordination. The economy needs a system of global governance, open markets, high economic and social standards, a more responsible monetary policy and more stringent supervisory policies; decision-making bodies and international economic bodies must be the main stakeholders driving this new approach. In particular, Europe needs a clear and transparent framework to reduce the instability that has been aggravated by, among other things, globalisation, and to guarantee wide-ranging reforms aimed at fostering growth and reducing the debt of individual Member States. This is the demand that the current resolution highlights to all the countries. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent years, we have seen an increase in the number and intensity of natural disasters, which have become increasingly global in scale, with disastrous consequences. A genuinely European response to such disasters that involves, and is binding on, all the various levels of government in which the European Union is structured is crucial to address this scenario. Ms Gardini’s valuable report, which I voted for, highlights the importance of a simplified and rationalised Civil Protection Mechanism that is more extensively and effectively coordinated at a political and operational level and is not encumbered by red tape. It must allow for the pooling of resources and skills and the optimisation of existing assets without increasing the financial burden in times of austerity. Greater attention to cross-border and geographically vulnerable areas and implementation of a culture of prevention will complement this new approach to ensure a rapid, speedy and effective response to any future needs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Fidanza on the report he has drafted, which fits logically into the framework of actions undertaken and promoted at Union level relating to tourism, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Union new powers in this field. I must stress the fact that I endorse the statement about the importance of Europe as a single destination for certified, quality tourism, as well as the intention to promote this idea by turning it into actions in terms of structures, allocation of resources, funding, and coordination of actions among the various levels of government in the countries of the Union. This is an approach to be valued and rewarded, given that the sector in question – with its implications in terms of the percentage of GDP produced, employment and new opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, and emphasis on environmental protection and enhancement – is in a position to develop and thus to respond to the major challenges of today. For all these reasons, I believe this report is positive, as it sends out an important signal for the promotion of a European tourism policy. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disaster that struck the Gulf of Mexico more than a year ago has prompted the European Commission to reflect on legislation relating to offshore oil activities. The European Parliament, too, wished to express its position on the matter, with this report. It has adopted a text that calls for the sector’s operators to have adequate technical and financial capacity and which aims to establish high safety standards so as to confirm the European Parliament’s leading role in promoting the safety of offshore activities. The new measures requested of the Commission in this regard will have to focus on international coordination and on a realistic approach that combines all of the quality procedures that exist in the sector and prevents the creation of new bodies or additional red tape, which could well delay the achievement of specific final objectives. In concrete terms, the report demands an improvement in communication and information and knowledge sharing mechanisms, in addition to greater accountability on the part of companies operating in the sector, and calls for the role and powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency to be strengthened and expanded. For all these reasons, I believe that the result achieved thanks to the negotiations on this text, for which we voted, is a positive one. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 As shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and as I have therefore followed this subject particularly closely, I feel I must congratulate Mrs Jordan Cizelj on the invaluable work she has done. Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations, due not least to the highly sensitive international context, the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent, harmonised legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely, no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future. I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies. The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards; greater attention to technical and scientific advances, particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility; increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people’s health; and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with transparency and with the role of licence holders.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation for relations with Central Asia and Mongolia, which I am honoured to chair, went to Mongolia just three weeks ago on the occasion of the eighth interparliamentary meeting of the European Parliament and Mongolia. It was a very useful and interesting experience. Mongolia is a country that deserves to be better known and there are not many opportunities in this Parliament to give it the attention that it should certainly receive. It is a country characterised by a multi-party parliamentary system, separation of powers, comparatively free public opinion and a level of human rights protection that stands out compared with the situation in many other countries in the region. It is also a country with development problems that is grappling with a difficult environmental situation and ongoing desertification. It has also been hit by extreme weather conditions recently. At the same time, it is very rich in natural resources – copper, gold, uranium and rare earths – which could attract a considerable influx of capital in the not-too-distant future. For all the above reasons, I think it is important to send out a signal of support for Mongolia at this crucial stage in its development, and to foster the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law as well as parliamentary control, so that the financial resources that become available to Mongolia can be used in future for the benefit of the people. We have to encourage Mongolia in its desire to develop closer relations with the European Union and urge it to adopt our standards and industrial regulations. We should help it move towards a market economy and more intense economic and trade relations, which are made possible by a climate of legal certainty and the development of the rule of law. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that the European Union and Mongolia are concluding will play a decisive role in this context. For all these reasons, 45 other Members and I have tabled this oral question. In this question, we ask the Commission to provide further details on the main characteristics of the agreement and the foreseeable schedule for its ratification. I would like to point out that the agreement has already been initialled, but there is currently deadlock over its signature, apparently because of doubts raised by a Member State on the legal basis used for some of the clauses. Additionally, we would like to ask the Commission about the possibility of opening a European Union delegation in Ulaanbaatar in the near future. Such an initiative could, in fact, significantly contribute to a further deepening of our political and economic cooperation with that country. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, the report on the labelling of textile products which we endorsed today marks an important step towards simplifying legislation for the benefit of consumers and all the European manufacturers working in the industry. With this regulation, we are laying down new rules on labelling in the textile industry; we are focusing increasingly on innovation in the sector and on speeding up the integration of European legislation, in order to benefit from innovative products safely. The text proposes, in fact, to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation, simplifying the existing regulatory framework and improving the transparency of procedures. Therefore, we cannot help but applaud the positive result achieved today in safeguarding European production. At the same time, however, we cannot fail to mention the indication of the country of origin issue. We hope that a further step forward can be taken soon with the approval of legislation regulating indications of origin in this sector as well. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of providing adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power plants has already been tackled by European Union legislation on the safety of the nuclear sector. Today, in the light of recent international events and the consequent decisions of the governments of the Member States in this regard, the issue is highly topical. We have expressed our backing for Mr Marinescu’s work, which deals with the specific cases of a number of countries which, upon accession, took on particular obligations on decommissioning nuclear power plants and received special support from the European Union for this very activity. Specific cases aside, on this issue we are duty-bound to establish an effective monitoring system to check and test the nuclear plants within EU territory. Indeed, the number of reactors that are thought to need to be decommissioned in EU territory in the near future is rather high. It will therefore be essential – including and above all in such cases –, to ensure the provision of guarantee mechanisms for setting aside adequate financial resources required to tackle both ordinary and extraordinary requirements.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the report by Mrs Rivasi is the result of an assessment of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 which aims to set general standards of conduct that would apply in any future global health emergency. Following a long and successful revision phase, the report makes cooperation, independence and transparency its core principles. It calls for greater and improved cooperation between the health authorities of the Member States and European institutions, in order to address harmonised and commensurate risk management. Its objectives are a change in the strategy of Member States regarding their national plans for the management of influenza, including stocks of vaccine, the publication of the names of all the experts consulted by the European health authorities, and an efficient relationship of trust with the media responsible for disseminating public health messages. That is why we voted in favour of it. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the problem of falsified medicinal products is one that is having an ever greater impact at international and EU level, in terms of the increased number of cases as well as the advances in the development of these products. These are the challenges to which Mrs Matias’s report – the outcome of long and painstaking negotiations – sets out to respond. The report, for which we expressed our support, has established a regulatory framework which, taking as its basis more precise and detailed definitions, took into account all the actors, stages and aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain – safety, traceability and obligations of the distribution chain – in order to achieve a good compromise. These are some of the issues on which we must try to work in order to achieve the main goal of establishing more stringent standards and to prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, thus achieving a positive and more comprehensive regulatory framework that safeguards the health of citizens, protecting them from the risk of serious consequences.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease in particular, are an EU health priority. The disease in question has serious consequences for sufferers, and not just in health terms. The costs incurred for direct and informal care are, in fact, high. Indeed, Alzheimer’s disease affects not only the sufferers, but all those who care for them, too. Therefore, we need a European response to the problem, a coordinated response by all the Member States, a synergy of concerted measures that concern, in particular, the fields of science and research and that are responsible for strengthening prevention and diagnosis so as to improve the treatment – including innovative treatment – available, as well as the dissemination of information among the Member States on the results achieved nationally, thereby raising public awareness of the disease.

 Council Directive 1999/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens under various systems of rearing with the added objective of protecting against unfair competition among producers in the different Member States. Although I support the principles of this directive, it must not be taken lightly that, as things stand, a great many European producers – having begun the process of converting their facilities – have run into real problems in completing the transformation and risk not being ready before 1 January 2012, the final deadline for complying with the directive. If we also bear in mind the real difficulties faced by many producers in obtaining financing to support conversion processes and the serious economic difficulties that they are still having to deal with today – with serious repercussions on the stability of their businesses and employment levels – I am convinced that something has to be done. Member States should intervene to promote measures that can help European producers in the poultry farming sector who, aiming to adapt to the new European legislation, have embarked on the process of converting their facilities but are very unlikely to complete it before the start of 2012.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Fjellner aim to integrate and complete the existing European Union regulations on the subject, bringing them up to date and making them capable of tackling the challenges that technological development has created and poses for public health. In our opinion, at its centre is the patient and his or her right to be informed and have access to scientific information, which has now become both qualitatively and quantitatively better and must be monitored, starting with a more precise and accurate distinction between scientific information and advertising. Indeed, the reports use precise and standardised criteria to establish the types of information to be provided, which data are optional or not, as well as the channels through which they may be made available, thereby setting out the obligations of pharmaceutical companies and Member States. Based on this understanding, we express our support for this report, recognising its merits not only in terms of health but also in social terms. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I would like to express my appreciation for the important contribution that this work will make in identifying a set of measures to be taken to overcome the current crisis and prevent the possibility of further crises. After the limits of a system of self-regulation were highlighted to a worrying degree by the recent financial crisis, it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to choose a global control system. The current phase of economic and financial instability, the most severe for decades, has led to an employment and social crisis on such a scale that decisive action is required to eliminate its negative repercussions and prioritise the opportunities that open up in a globalised economy. The crisis in recent years has sorely tried most of the advanced economies. Recovery is still slow for some countries even today, and the ongoing fragility of financial markets makes global coordination and the choice of appropriate economic and industrial strategies key aspects in combating the financial crisis. Global supervision should, in fact, promote the stabilisation of solid financial markets and sustain the current recovery, guaranteeing strong growth in demand and employment levels. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measure sets out to reinforce and rationalise the system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union: these are the ambitious goals set by the McAvan reports, which aim to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC respectively. Thanks to a close and effective working relationship between the European Council and Parliament, and between the parliamentary committees responsible for this area, we have reached the point where we are able today to discuss a proposal that aims to improve the EU pharmacovigilance system, and to conclude the consistent work that the European Union has carried out in this field over more than a decade. Simplification, transparency and rationalisation may be considered the key points of these two reports, which propose measures aiming to guarantee the best possible protection of public health on the basis of standards that are harmonised throughout Europe. Reference is made to an extensive series of actions, ranging from better definition of the roles and responsibilities of the main national and international stakeholders seeking to ensure a new, more informed and active involvement of patients, who are given a fundamental role in the system, to the increased transparency of information concerning the safety of medicinal products and the simplification of activities involved in communicating, recording and evaluating suspected adverse reactions. The current pharmacovigilance system must also be improved through closer cooperation at European, national and regional levels. Effective participation at all three of these levels will, in fact, ensure a profitable exchange of information on the side effects of medicinal products. When reorganised as a network, with Internet support, the new pharmacovigilance system will be able to ensure a high level of information sharing and security to benefit patients, national authorities and healthcare professionals. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Thank you Mr President and excuse me. With my speech, I would like to highlight how the progressive erosion of European farmers’ incomes, despite growing profit margins for the agro-industrial sector, is causing a worrying economic marginalisation of agricultural workers, with the consequent abandonment of agricultural activities. This requires, therefore, a change of course, which the European Commission itself recognises and which the report being examined and put to the vote in Parliament this morning – for which I would like to express my support – highlights with ample explanations and suggestions on a legislative and departmental level as well. Indeed we must combat global speculation on commodities and guarantee the security of supply. Moreover, greater price transparency must also be guaranteed, not only to give farmers justice and dignity, but also to correct the serious imbalances that exist with regard to bargaining power and to prevent abusive practices between the various operators. Agriculture must be confirmed as a sector of economic and social stability and it must regain power in the European and in the globalised commercial context. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge of preventing pollution from industrial emissions is a very current problem that involves a number of areas, including, of course, environmental protection, public health and the competitiveness of businesses. Precisely in order to have an integrated approach to these important areas, the directive in question was specifically aimed at facilitating the implementation of the best available techniques for controlling emissions, with harmonised EU standards for the authorisation of industrial facilities being developed in order to protect the environment, which is frequently threatened and compromised by industrial emissions. However, it does all this while also taking account of the need, which is shared by our industries, to maintain the competitive edge that is necessary to overcome the challenges of the future. A significant political commitment and intense and patient mediatory action were required on this issue. Thanks to this action, we have finally been able to reach agreement at the third trialogue. For these reasons, I would like to express my support for this report. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight that the situation in Kyrgyzstan reflects a reality which, for too long, has not been given the importance it deserves. The reality I refer to is the instability in Central Asia, which is unfortunately increasing, while hopes for democracy and economic progress, at least in many of these countries, are especially fragile. In recent months, Kyrgyzstan has suffered as a result of harsh conflicts that will leave a legacy of interethnic strife, at least in the immediate future, making the stabilisation of that country even more difficult than it was in the past. As has already been said, the role of the international community and of the European Union in particular is to aid Kyrgyzstan as much as possible in three ways: firstly, by providing immediate aid for emergency supplies and rebuilding the damaged homes; secondly – as regards the European Union within the framework of the Central Asia strategy and the instruments implemented in that context – by providing financial aid that is as long term as possible; and, thirdly, by providing political support to aid the process of restoring constitutional order and the development of the rule of law. The constitutional referendum held in Kyrgyzstan on 28 June, in what were clearly very difficult conditions, may be regarded as the first step on the road to restoring constitutional order. The elections of 28 June also received the approval of the OSCE observation mission, which obviously took into account the special conditions in which the referendum was held. The new constitutional order in Kyrgyzstan will be directed more towards a parliamentary system than a presidential system. This will perhaps allow for greater recognition of the various ethnic groups in the country and of the need to obtain the consensus of the various groups in such a divided and composite country. The European Union and Kyrgyzstan are bound by a partnership and cooperation agreement that provides for regular meetings by a parliamentary cooperation committee. Our hope is that our inter-parliamentary relations will resume as soon as possible, with the participation of a democratically elected Kyrgyz parliament. As has already been said, in the immediate future, Kyrgyzstan needs stability and our political and financial support: let us not stint on either. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is being asked, as we know, to express a definitive opinion on food information to consumers. I should start by saying that this has unquestionably been a difficult, long and controversial legislative process, which could not have been shortened. The aim, in fact, is to harmonise European food legislation through regulations that will make information to consumers transparent, thereby preventing a situation in which they are led to make confused choices or choices that may even be harmful for their health. The report by Mrs Sommer, who must be thanked for her efforts in bringing together a large number of requirements, is therefore intended to provide a solution to the controversies and the differences between the consumer information systems in force in the Member States. It is not by chance that national regulations still differ in terms of how to describe the nature of foodstuffs for sale, creating a system that differs from one country to the next and also fuelling unfair competition, to the detriment of potential consumers. On the basis of the European Commission proposal, an attempt is therefore being made to revamp the current legislation by involving both the food industries and consumers. At the same time, the report obliges the European food industry to introduce some clarity into mandatory labelling, as well as the labelling and presentation of the nutritional value of foods. In a globalised market, the European Union could not escape the need to adapt and reform legislation on food products in order to protect the food trade, among other things, and to safeguard it from increasingly invasive and uncontrolled international competition. There is nothing new about the fact that we are hearing more and more about the dangers posed by food products that surreptitiously carry designations and statements that often do not meet dietary requirements but are nonetheless passed off as products that are good for human health.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the popular unrest that has broken out in recent days in the capital of Kyrgyzstan has halted the progress of the ‘Tulip Revolution’ that kindled hopes of democratic change in the former Soviet republic in 2005. The European Parliament is following the development of the political crisis in the country with great concern. This is not merely because of the country’s crucial geostrategic position for Russia and the United States, but also because the stability of Central Asia, its political and economic development and interregional cooperation is of interest to the EU, not least, due to the importance of Central Asia for our energy supplies and our economic and trade partnership. The risk of civil war breaking out and of a ‘second Afghanistan’ must be averted. We put our faith in the diplomatic mediation that the Presidents of the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan – the latter in his capacity as the current president of the OSCE – are deploying in their negotiations with the interim Kyrgyz Government for the establishment of public order and constitutional legality, in order that free elections can be held and the country’s problems resolved. As Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation, I hope, even despite the recent ethnic clashes, that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan.

The issue of an agricultural product quality policy has found an authoritative and unanimous response from the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby making the existing legislation more complete. European agricultural producers have finally gained recognition in European legislation on the quality of their produce linked to the region of production. This represents a guarantee for sheltering them from market globalisation and for ensuring that the ‘informed’ consumer can reject produce that does not bear the obligatory geographic indication of origin, that is not certified clearly, and that does not comply with marketing and anti-counterfeiting rules. Consumers will be able to make their purchasing choices in full knowledge of the rules relating to their desired product. The European Parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers. The health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former. An amendment of mine on the protection of product characteristics, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved, recognises that the regions have an essential role as producer partners, in particular, of the producers of traditional and organic products, and calls for regions to be involved in the recognition and promotion of products with a geographical indication, traditional products and organic products. I am pleased to note the recognition of this indication. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I congratulate the European Commission on having submitted to the Council the amended regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union. The report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up-to-date way, and does so for two reasons. The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively. The report is in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, in which particular attention is paid to energy policy by means of the strengthening and coordinating of its methods and of the investments required for the sector. The Copenhagen Summit’s failure to satisfy the world’s political leaders means that the policies to be pursued require a change of strategy. The European Parliament is paying particular attention to the problem with the aim of overseeing energy investments in the construction, transport and storage of associated energy products, so as to satisfy the production and distribution industries and hence safeguard consumers’ health. The second reason is that, since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand – like imports – is growing every day, EU energy policy must focus on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency.Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Donskis’s report on the European Union’s policy on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2011 for a number of reasons. The report highlights the importance of international humanitarian law (IHL), and particularly urges the EU to take a stronger stance in implementing IHL and considering it when entering into bilateral agreements with third countries. Not only is it important that the EU respect human rights, but we should do everything possible to ensure that basic standards of human rights are upheld in countries throughout the world, which the report directly encourages.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I have drafted an opinion for Mr Ferreira’s report on small-scale and artisanal fisheries. There are still too many legal and social obstacles preventing women’s full participation at all levels in the fisheries sector. Women work on fishing boats and are involved at all levels of the production chain: in fish capture, in breeding and harvesting in aquaculture, and in processing and placing on the market; they are boat-owners; they organise fishing activities and provide support to the fishermen at sea. The work of women in the fisheries sector needs to be made more visible, especially in the artisanal sector, since 85 % of women active in this sector feel they are discriminated against. This is seen as an exclusively male sector: there are obstacles to women’s advancement and the support structures available are inadequate. I am pleased that Mr Ferreira has given due attention to this opinion and that Mr Damanaki has underlined the importance of cooperation between the Committee on Fisheries and the other parliamentary committees. I would therefore like to underline some of the priority actions to be taken at EU and Member State level. What is most important is the protection of the legal and social status of women working in the sector so as to ensure equal wages, in other words safeguarding social and economic rights. Above all insurance must be provided for covering risks at sea. Much has been done, but much more can be done. Barbara Matera  (PPE

While the CAP currently has several types of promotion measures in place, it is important to expand these measures to encourage economic growth in the agri-food sector. The European agri-food sector has the ability to prosper and assist economic stabilisation in the Member States, and developing more extensive promotion measures both for the internal European market and for external market shares. For these reasons, it is important that local, regional, and external promotion measures are adopted, with the focus placed on short food-supply chains and local farming systems. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first and foremost to thank the rapporteur for having taken on board all – or most – of the points in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am Vice-Chair. Economic crises compromise efforts made towards gender equality: the employment rate among women falls ever lower and the gender pay gap grows ever wider. The contractual safeguards for many women and mothers are still precarious and the number of women in leadership positions and in the political, science and technology sectors is low. Adequate funding for EU programmes is necessary to reduce the gender pay gap and encourage access for women to highly skilled jobs. An increase in the labour market participation of women would free an important amount of talent that has remained untapped for many years. In the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we proposed uniform formats for women’s integration, and above all specific measures targeting vulnerable groups of women.

The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 come at a difficult economic and financial time, when the Member States are being forced to introduce harsh fiscal consolidation measures. However, the EU budget can only be seen as offering huge added value with regard to investments made at national level. The Commission’s proposal freezes ceilings at their 2013 levels and significantly weakens the requests made by the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 to strengthen European policies to enhance competitiveness, small and medium-sized enterprises and sustainable infrastructure. Parliament hopes for a ‘responsible’ reaction from the Council.

The European Year of Citizens is intended to increase the active civic and democratic participation of Union citizens. As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I support this proposal because I hope that it will not only reinforce equality and solidarity among the Member States, but will also enhance gender equality among citizens and increase the participation of women in the economic, political and social life of the European Union.

By mobilising the EGF with an amount of EUR 6 455 104, workers will be helped to return to the labour market, which is especially important because these employees have highly specialised training in their field which it is nearly impossible to apply in other industries. For these reasons, I voted in favour of Mr Bendtsen’s report. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– Spain’s application for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the construction sector in the NUTS II region of Aragón addresses redundancies caused by the current economic crisis. The financial and economic crisis has greatly impacted Spain’s construction industry due to a lack of demand for new construction. This trend is in line with the falling demand for new construction that exists throughout Europe, but the condition of the housing market has degraded at an even more rapid pace in Spain. A mobilisation of the EGF for an amount of EUR 1 300 000 will allow workers that had been employed in construction to diversify their skills, which will alleviate some of the burden of unemployment in Aragón. I voted in favour of Mr Escobar’s report for these reasons. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Gustafsson’s report on the role of women in the green economy, as developing the green economy involves creating new jobs, in particular, for prevalently male sectors where the participation of women is still limited. By analysing data and statistics regarding different employment areas in the European Union, I noted with regret that a high concentration of ‘green’ jobs are normally filled by men. In most cases, women involved in the transition linked to new job opportunities are underpaid compared with men. The disparities in access to different green trades and professions are a threat to the equality of the transition towards a greener labour market. To facilitate women’s access to new ‘green’ jobs, I would argue it is vital for the Commission and Member States to organise specialist training courses in areas such as renewable energy, thereby giving women real opportunities to join the labour market in remote areas where unemployment affects young people in particular. I am referring, for example, to the potential for women to succeed in the area of solar and wind power in southern Europe. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the report because I believe that protecting the geographical indications of agricultural products and foodstuffs has undoubted advantages for consumers and producers. The interests of the countries involved are thus better protected as regards product quality and safety and sustainable rural development.

 Consular protection for citizens abroad (in accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 46 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) operates both for day-to-day matters and for emergency situations. Emergency situations are arising in an increasing number of contexts and for this reason the simplification of access to rights and better knowledge of these among citizens is desirable, so that they are in a better position to benefit from solidarity between Member States if their own country is not directly represented in the third country or if they are having difficulties reaching their own embassy. For this reason I am in favour of the report, though I recognise that further action and future clarifications will be necessary, for example concerning the role and functions of the delegations and the definition of the necessary financial resources to ensure they can be implemented.

Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Foster’s report, which calls for strong action from the Commission, including sanctions, in order to force Member States that are violating their obligations under the Single European Sky (SES) legislation to fall into line. The SES is an ambitious project aimed at creating a single airspace that would allow increased capacity and efficiency in air traffic management, also bringing economic and environmental benefits. The implementation of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research programme, which is the technological pillar of the SES project, is a vital aspect for its success, especially from 2015 on, when the program should be launched. Unfortunately, there are still several gaps in the single airspace project, particularly with regard to the realisation of Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB). In this regard, I welcome the new impetus given a few days ago by Italy and other countries involved in the ‘Blue Med’ FAB, which is of strategic value since it involves the Southern Mediterranean countries.

Madam President, passenger rights are central to the debate on transport. The concept of accessibility is the cardinal point of this report, including physical accessibility for all to destinations and information. Correct information must be available to travellers, using various means and covering a range of needs. Furthermore, passengers must have access to assistance through helpdesks with adequately trained and competent staff. Finally we call for revision of the Package Travel Directive 90/314/EEC, in order to ensure that consumers and firms in the sector have a clear legal framework for both standard situations and exceptional situations, eliminating abusive and unfair practices and ensuring greater transparency. Mr Bach’s report addresses all of these aspects and I therefore voted in favour of it. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I welcome Mr Simpson’s report. Suitable and up-to-date training of crews is essential for ensuring safety on board ships. Training should therefore comply with international standards, and be standardised, in order to overcome problems often posed by the presence on board a given ship of workers from different countries and trained according to different systems. All actions aimed at upholding safety in the sector must be regarded as essential, in particular the strengthening of provisions on issuance of certificates of competence, medical fitness and fitness for duty, and the proposals on better working conditions and control of alcohol abuse. It is essential to aim for greater involvement of the Commission through greater transparency, and for easier access to information in order to a provide fuller picture of the employment situation in this sector.

 I welcome the report by Ms García Pérez. I believe that simpler and faster registration procedures will encourage farmers to register their quality products and ingredients and to communicate their added value more effectively to customers, who will thus be in a position to make more informed choices. The role of foodstuff producer groups – by which I mean all producers, processors or producer-processors – is important, and they will be able to take steps to protect their own trade names and to promote the authenticity and reputation of their goods. This vote coincides with the start of discussions over the reform of the common agricultural policy 2014-2020, where we will also talk about managing supply, which the regulation adopted here does not address.

 I welcome the resolution on the proposals regarding a European banking union. The fact that we are voting on this resolution the day after the Commission tabled two proposals to enhance banking supervision shows that Parliament – the only democratically elected EU institution – is keen to make a major contribution to putting together the instruments that will give the Union and the single currency greater stability, without negative repercussions for Member States that are not part of the euro area. In my view, it is essential that we achieve a fully functioning European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as soon as possible, which, although it certainly further limits Member State sovereignty over public finances, at least has the benefit of excluding the contributions they pay from the calculation of their sovereign debts.

 The resolution on the alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in European countries by the CIA focuses on an issue that continues to cause controversy, including in Italy. Collating flight data managed by Eurocontrol suggests that there is an illegal system that has led to suspicious disappearances, which is unacceptable. All responsibilities need to be established so that there is no recurrence of similar cases in the future. The fight against terrorism in the EU should be conducted in compliance with EU law and the sovereignty of the Member States, which have the right and the duty to prosecute those suspected of terrorism and bring them to trial.

 I am dissatisfied by today’s vote on beef labelling. Although it was only by a few votes, we were unable to keep voluntary labelling. A specific request from the entire Italian supply chain, which rightly expressed concern, given that abolition involves a financial loss for farmers – many have already invested in and successfully use this tool – as well as a competitive disadvantage compared with other markets, as Italian production is characterised by its quality. The fact that the rapporteur has decided to refer the text back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) bodes well, considering that in Council, a majority block may form to reintroduce compulsory labelling systems to defend the principles of quality and traceability.

 I welcome the vote on Mr Dorfmann’s report, which aims to safeguard an important sector and one which is an area of excellence for Italy and for Europe. Parliament is granting more flexibility to Member States so that the sector can also take definitive decisions before the entry into force of the common agricultural policy (CAP) 2014-2020 reform, which we are working hard on at the moment. With today’s vote, we are pursuing the objective of giving greater flexibility to Member States so that they can decide on the national financial envelope of the wine sector, all of which is linked to the proposal for direct payments under the new CAP.

 The huge delays in adapting the package of basic regulations on the common agricultural policy (CAP) to the Treaty of Lisbon are down to the Council’s intransigence and the deferral of the Polish Presidency, which prevented us from finalising the agreements that had earlier been made. Today, we once again find ourselves faced not just with the old regulations in the package, but also with new texts on the CAP and with voting on alignment to the Treaty of Lisbon, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in April 2011. The changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon – abolishing the old comitology system, allowing the Commission to exercise implementation and enforcement powers that amend the role of the Council, which, acting on a proposal by the Commission, can adopt measures to set prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations – show us the important role of Parliament even more. Accordingly, we need to align the body of laws to the new framework, bringing in an alternative system that is in keeping with Articles 290 and 291 and allows Parliament to act to protect farmers, land, products and agricultural markets.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached with the Council has resulted in some significant improvements. I am thinking of the establishment of strong, independent national regulators to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, which is one of the key points of the recast; the minimum five-year term for contracts between Member States and infrastructure managers, which will allow for better long-term investment planning; and the major focus on safety, both in terms of rolling stock maintenance, an important distinction being made between light and heavy maintenance, and in terms of the technological modernisation of infrastructure and trains to improve safety (particularly through the European Rail Traffic Management System). In short, the net outcome is positive overall, although one crucial point for the completion of the single rail market remains unresolved, which is the opening up of national rail passenger traffic. I hope the Commission will keep up the momentum it developed a few months ago and will put forward a new proposal in that respect by the end of the year. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text we have adopted today provides a good basis for starting negotiations with the Council. I am certain that this innovative instrument will lead to improvements in road safety, drivers’ working conditions and competition in the sector. I am particularly pleased regarding the amendment that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on joint liability. I believe it should be possible to hold any operator in the transport sector liable for infringements of the regulation in question, and not just road haulage companies and their drivers. The text also calls for smart tachographs to be fitted to all vehicles, old and new, by 2020. This requirement will certainly entail a major effort by companies in the sector, but it is equally important to remain ambitious and gradually install digital tachographs even in those vehicles that use analogue ones. A final critical point is, I believe, the definition of ‘daily working period’. In my view, it is not consistent with other definitions given in existing legislation, particularly with regard to a driver’s rest periods or breaks, which would remain part of the working period according to this definition.

 Parliament’s adoption of the report recommending deployment of the eCall system is a clear signal of its support for the topic of road safety. Every year in Europe, there are more than 40 000 fatalities on the roads. By means of the eCall system, it is anticipated that this number could be reduced by more than 2 500, with a reduction of 10-15% in the number of injured, thanks to an increase of 40-50% in the speed and efficiency of response centres. Furthermore, it is important to remember that eCall will have minimal economic repercussions on final costs, which amount to about EUR 100 per vehicle – a perfectly reasonable price given the great benefits it will bring. It is now essential that the Member States and the respective mobile phone networks commit themselves to improving their infrastructure so as to guarantee this service to the maximum extent possible. As of now, 5 500 drivers have use of such a service in 10 countries: the positive effects achievable from 2015 with its introduction in all 27 Member States would be of vital importance.

 It is currently difficult for the consumer as well as supervisory bodies to distinguish between normal food products and those designed for specific groups. The reasons for this ambiguity could be differences in the interpretation and application of rules by Member States. That is why I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s report: we need a legislative reorganisation, with uniform laws that guarantee innovation, competitiveness of businesses and protection of information for citizens. The European Union must commit to achieving uniform treatment in the area of food so as to provide greater legal, economic and social certainty, covering not just the goods consumed and produced within the European Union but also those which are exported and imported. In this sense the regulatory provisions on gluten and lactose are of paramount importance as they are aimed at protecting an ever-growing section of the population. Figures show that food-related conditions are becoming more and more common, causing an increase in depression, stress and general poor health: let us help make these people’s complicated lives easier.

 In the Treaty on European Union, the Member States pledged to safeguard the principles of democracy and respect for human rights. Clearly all candidate countries must have satisfied these conditions before negotiations begin, but this does not imply indifference to conditions outside the EU. The last few years have been extremely dramatic for Tibet and the people of this nation have given a strong and succinct message: after 50 years of Chinese occupation, Tibetans are calling on the world for real change – a change that includes dialogue with the Chinese leadership, not an intensification of violence. The strategic partnership between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China should be based on common principles and values: the latter’s great economic dependence on exports ‘Made in China’ and the importance China attaches to its international reputation can influence such a change, if we make the effort. To guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, freedom of speech and association and the release of political prisoners, we need to take concrete action. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Gender-based violence and all forms of harassment and exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be wiped out. Full and equal participation of women in civil, social, cultural, economic and political life, and elimination of any kind of discrimination are the prime objectives of the international community. Protection of women’s rights has received a significant boost thanks to international instruments and commitments from the United Nations and the European Union. I think we are all in agreement that female genital mutilation is a serious form of abuse and torture of children and, I must specify, children from the age of just four. Today too many women are still subjected to these practices, which cause psychological trauma, indescribable physical suffering and repercussions on their health and which cannot be justified by tradition or as a symbol of identity. Ladies and gentlemen, we must all say a loud ‘no’ to female genital mutilation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this resolution. I must say that I am very sad to see the negative repercussions of this social depression, if we can call it that, and I am firmly convinced that we must act promptly to avoid a worsening of the global economy. The Treaty requires economic matters to be seen as an issue of common interest, with policies inspired by the need for healthy finances that cannot compromise the functioning of the economic and monetary union. The Stability Pact itself highlights the need to create incentives for prudent budgets, obviously avoiding excessive public deficits and strengthening surveillance. This surveillance allows us to identify risks as well as possible and take responsibility promptly. As the Commission has said, the EU must take shared responsibility, which I think also involves risk sharing. That is the only way we will be able to ensure coordinated and well monitored budgets.

 I voted in favour of this regulation. The main reason for doing so was that, for the first time, we saw a legislative text that really lays the groundwork for new and essential mechanisms for securing sovereign debts and building towards growth. Here, contrary to the view of my group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – I had no hesitation in voting in favour of eurobonds and the redemption fund. I voted in favour of the amendment on the golden rule, which would exclude investments from deficit calculations, and I regret that it was not carried. The way things are now, it is time to take urgent action: no more blind austerity; we have seen that it cannot work by itself. We need to mutualise debt while calling for austerity and, above all, we need to support growth before it is too late. The EU must take shared responsibility which, I think, also involves risk sharing. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the reports by Francesca Balzani. Following flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied for assistance to the European Union; the disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). I would remind you that the Solidarity Fund should be mobilised mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on the living conditions, environment or economy of one or more regions of a Member State. The conditions in the affected areas worsened, as always happens in these situations, because of the tragedy of the lives lost, the large number of wounded people, the families who lost everything and the very serious damage to homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructures. In these regions, the use of the EUR 18 million released by the fund will therefore help our fellow citizens to regain the peace of mind that they have sadly lost. Finally, let me congratulate the volunteers of the Italian Civil Protection Agency who, in those weeks, as well as currently in Emilia and Lombardy and as always in the past, have shown professionalism and humanity.

 I voted in favour of the reports by Mr Fernandes. Following the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied to the European Union for assistance. The disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the Solidarity Fund. I would point out that this fund should intervene mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on living conditions, the environment or the economy in one or more regions of a Member State. Conditions in the affected areas were made worse, as always happens in these cases, owing to the tragic loss of human life, the high number of injured people, the families who lost everything and severe damage to residential homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. Therefore, deploying in these regions the EUR 18 million granted from the fund will help our fellow citizens regain the peace of mind which, unfortunately, they have lost. Lastly, allow me to praise the Italian Civil Protection volunteers who, during those weeks, demonstrated professionalism and humanity, just as they have done in recent days in Emilia-Romagna and in Lombardy, and always have done in the past.

 I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report on cross-border voluntary activities in the EU. Following the visibility acquired through the European Year of Volunteering, it is appropriate to focus on specific measures to further promote volunteering. The ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ will train people engaged principally in cross-border volunteering. Its creation will make an invaluable and much-needed contribution to society, demonstrating the need to build a Europe based on respect for fundamental rights and the creation of solidarity and welfare, not just within national borders and not just in economic terms. In a constantly changing society such as that in Europe, enhancing solidarity is an asset. It enables us to address and overcome human, social, intergenerational and environmental needs and concerns.

 The conditions under which former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has, for months, been imprisoned and suffered various forms of physical and psychological violence are unacceptable. First of all, we must urge the Ukrainian authorities to ensure full adherence to the fundamental rights of their prisoners, guaranteeing fair treatment, adequate medical assistance in an appropriate facility, unrestricted visits by relatives and sufficient access to their lawyers. This situation affects the relationship between the EU and Ukraine; I therefore consider that the authorities in Kiev should not ignore what we are saying in this Parliament, which is yet another position statement following on from numerous interventions from the highest officials of the European institutions and Member States.

I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe, as I believe that we should not confuse homophobia, which is of course unacceptable, with family law. As the interpretation of the European Court of Justice confirms, there is not, and there should not be, a single family model, but rather we acknowledge the diversity of national legal schemes, thus excluding the possibility of predominance by EU sources. The European Union, in fact, is a community made up of 27 Member States, 27 different cultures, and 27 different traditions, and we have to protect unity in diversity, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The European Union’s task is to foster the harmonisation, rather than the uniformity, of family law. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

As we all know, the global financial crisis, which started in 2008, has had terrible consequences and repercussions, affecting the real economy almost immediately. The discrepancy between consumer demand and supply has had devastating effects on employment too, thus giving rise to serious problems on the labour market. Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and responsibility to combat the crisis. Among the various measures to be taken is the reinforcement of the single market’s stability through the introduction of innovative strategies, designed to achieve growth that is not just economic, but also social. I think that fiscal consolidation through the introduction of a common system of taxation for financial transactions could have positive effects on the single market, and for that reason, I voted for Ms Podimata’s report. There could be several positive effects. However, I would argue that precisely because of the now highly globalised nature of the financial sector and its services, a further shift should be made, by promoting the introduction of a worldwide financial transaction tax: firstly, the full 27 Member States and then the G20 should demonstrate cohesion in seeking this objective.

 I am voting in favour of Rita Borsellino’s report to strengthen the European Union’s internal security strategy. Over the last 30 years, a succession of serious events, such as natural disasters and terrorist and mafia atrocities, has profoundly shaken public opinion, thus hindering economic development, undermining the political integrity of the countries affected, and eroding trust between citizens and institutions. To regain this trust, a broader synergy must be created between social and institutional agents to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of respect for fundamental rights. It is no longer useful to examine social phenomena in a local context; we now need to look beyond national boundaries. We must ensure security by maintaining existing strategies and finding innovate ways to supplement them: to be credible, we must earn the trust of the European peoples and address their needs more effectively.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are essential transport nodes and factors that contribute to growth and territorial cohesion. Frequently, however, they only survive thanks to massive injections of public money. Nowadays, this is increasingly scarce, and therefore it is important that they should have a specific vocation in order to avoid a proliferation that would lead to non-utilisation or under-utilisation of the airport infrastructure. A typical example of this is the scores of airports in northern Italy located just 20-30 kilometres from one another. At the moment, there is no precise definition for a regional airport, and the Commission should therefore set common criteria for a proper definition. Finally, I am concerned about the formulation regarding the scope of application and, in particular, the exclusion of airports whose principal catchment area is a capital city. I do not think it is correct as a catchment area is not uniform and can change. Despite these critical points, I voted in favour in order to draw the Commission’s attention to these important airports. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approval of this resolution is a very important political signal in the fight against maritime piracy. Paragraph 30 of the resolution I proposed specifies that in the event of disputes between countries following military action aiming to combat piracy attacks in international waters, the national jurisdiction of the flag state shall be applied on the ships concerned as well as on the military staff employed aboard, as provided by international law. This aspect is crucial for avoiding future controversies like the one currently ongoing between Italy and India, and to defend the prerogatives of military personnel deployed in Operation Atalanta and as Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) on merchant vessels. I dedicate the approval of this text to Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, the two Italian sailors unjustly detained for almost three months in prison in India waiting for India to decide to acknowledge Italian jurisdiction and to allow these two soldiers to be judged by the Italian courts. I hope that European diplomacy will renew its support for Italy in this battle of civilisation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

In order to promote the development of world trade, the 27 Member States drew up a common trade policy with third countries in an attempt to abolish trade restrictions and excessive tariffs. This trade liberalisation does not imply the non-respect of rights and obligations by commercial partners operating on an international level.

 I welcome Ms Niebler’s proposal on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union. Now, with the major increase in mobility within the Union and the concurrent major developments in the telecoms sector, we cannot ask our citizens to take on the burden of excessively high costs, especially for data roaming. I therefore support the further lowering of roaming charges – tariffs that ensure complete transparency and consumer protection. I believe that these new measures, in force from 1 July 2012 and running at full speed from 1 July 2014, giving customers the chance to choose a different roaming services provider from their national operator, will encourage a greater number of operators to compete, further reducing tariffs.

 I voted in favour of the report because it points out the need for enhanced legal certainty, more interpretative clarity and uniform application of the regulations across the EU regarding the rights of air passengers, including those with reduced mobility. Greater and more effective cooperation among the different actors must be secured so as to ensure that passenger rights are protected and to clarify their various responsibilities. It is also important to clarify and strengthen existing rights and to ensure that consumers are made aware of them. Knowledge of rights is essential in ensuring that passengers can access them. That is why information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey, starting from when the passenger is considering whether to purchase a ticket. To help ensure that rights are upheld, there should be contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues that arise when flight disruptions occur.

In this sense, Serbia is in a position to become an important player in guaranteeing security and stability in the region.

 I voted in favour of the proposal because it aims to bring 26 trade policy regulations into line with the new primary-law provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. For example, the legislature will be able to delegate non-essential legislative acts to the executive, while retaining the power to revoke the delegation at any time. The affected measures are mostly designed to allow the use of trade safeguard regulations, apart from the regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. The Commission is proposing changes only where the Council decisions specifically provided for have previously applied. As a result of these specific decision-making procedures, European trade policy has hitherto, essentially, been explicitly excluded from the comitology procedures. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, these special arrangements have now been terminated. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the general guidelines for the 2013 budget, since they take note of the economic crisis afflicting Europe and propose serious and decisive measures for our future, such as the need for reinforcing the collective effort to carry out the actions already undertaken, specific actions and greater budgetary efforts to promote growth and employment. It is vital to support competitiveness with investments that would create jobs, above all, for young people, whose education, mobility and IT skills make them the main actors in achieving the future results we hope to obtain with the Europe 2020 strategy. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must note with regret the absence of Baroness Ashton from this debate. It would have been important for all of us to hear directly from her the latest updates on the situation involving the two Italian marines unjustly imprisoned in India after being arrested following the military operation against piracy in which they were involved. I am sorry not to be able to hear Baroness Ashton speak, and I hope that Mr Piebalgs’s response will provide more precise details about the progress made in the last few days. This is not just an Italian issue, it is very much a European issue, because – you see – the exclusive jurisdiction of the country flying the flag is a universally recognised principle of international law, and the Indian authorities having brought it into doubt risks undermining the very heart of the battle against piracy by the international community and the European Union itself, which, as we have said, is involved in the Atalanta mission. Therefore, I appeal to the EU institutions to make all possible diplomatic efforts to repatriate our soldiers, ensure international law is upheld and make sure that they are the subject of a fair and transparent investigation in their country of origin. In addition, Madam President, I would like to comment on the many speeches I have heard from my fellow Members from the radical left. Frankly, I am convinced that Europe must be committed on a political and diplomatic level to help Somalia and all struggling countries to develop, but this cannot be a sufficient response to the hundreds of hostages and families waiting for their loved ones to come home, who are tired of talk and want practical solutions in the matter of international security.

 I voted against the motion for a resolution, from the European Parliament’s left-leaning parties, on Hungary as I consider it to be a shameful fabrication, especially given the openness of the Hungarian Government as regards the points highlighted by the European Commission. Furthermore, the adoption of this resolution could have a counterproductive effect, undermining the Hungarian people’s confidence in the European Union. This is a situation to be avoided, especially during this period of growing euroscepticism. More generally, we are faced with a completely cynical political attack against a government legitimately elected with a large majority and that is proudly protecting the rights and the sovereignty of its own people.

 Digital citizenship is a fundamental part of the European Union, and necessary for producing well-informed players in the electronic processes of democracy. The first issue we need to address is that of the digital divide and in particular the protection of the least-protected groups, including minors. The adoption of the report on protecting children in the digital world lays the foundations for a more organic framework directive that includes all the measures concerning children in previous EU legislation. It is undoubtedly necessary to encourage action to combat online crime, which has been successfully adopted by some Member States. But the cultural and legal differences among Member States make it hard to establish clearly which content should be penalised. Self-regulation adopted so far has proven useful, but has demonstrated limits that must be corrected with a unified framework of rights that tackles conduct that could have serious consequences for young Europeans. Thanks to this report, we are on the way to greater uniformity of intervention. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate before this one was on the 20th anniversary of the single market. We had that debate because the single market is one of the European Union’s main goals. If the single market were to fail, the entire European Union could fail. The same is true of Erasmus: for many young people – and not only for them – it represents the image of the European Union. Without Erasmus, many people’s perception of European unity would disappear. This is more the case than with the single market because with the single market there is also, but not only, an economic advantage for businesses and for our countries. There is nothing wrong with this, but Erasmus is different, it is about students wanting to break out of their confines and discover the cultures of other countries, share the experience of studying with people who speak a different language and perhaps have different customs and traditions, and discover, renew and strengthen our common identity and our unity. This is how Europe came into being, not through treaties or dreadful bureaucracy, but through genuine lived experiences. Perhaps without Erasmus, the single market would also mean something different, the spirit of it would be different and so weakening Erasmus could weaken our Union. The title of this debate is absolutely right: Erasmus is in danger, and the danger is that, without Erasmus, a different concept of Europe would develop. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and to tell the Council to make a real effort to find and authorise the funds, since the hole that exists is down to the Member States. The Europe of the future will depend on those who want to study and have experiences abroad now. Let us try not to let them down and let us be brave enough to show what Europe is really made of. I wish the Council good luck with its work and hope to hear only good news! Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, the Year of European Citizens is a way of focusing attention on the half a billion people living in the EU. It is a way of remembering that all of the other measures we are discussing in these days – the banking union, the economic and financial measures for combating the crisis – have the interests of citizens as their primary objective. The aim of the European Year on which we have voted is to enhance the rights attached to Union citizenship and the role played by the associations in the Union, reinforcing the right of students, teachers, artists and those working creatively to move freely. In short, it aims to strengthen European identity through concrete initiatives in which the citizens play the leading role. This is a real bottom-up approach to building the Union, and the reason why I voted in favour. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this rather wonderful report by Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, which we in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) helped to improve. The reasons for such praise lie, above all, in the acknowledgement of copyright as the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creation, investment and production. Dissemination of works, following their digitisation, is the main way to protect and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage. The European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, but much of it lies unused in the archives and libraries of our Member States, totally inaccessible to citizens. It is therefore right to make these works as accessible as possible to all. Indeed, the EU’s true wealth is its cultural heritage, which is unequalled around the world but is often neglected and loses not only its cultural value, but its economic value as well. The compromise reached between protecting copyright and allowing public access is the best way to reverse this trend and breathe fresh life into our cultural heritage, without violating any rights. It is true that perhaps not all the goals have been met, yet the glass is surely half-full rather than half-empty. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Schengen is an asset to Europe. Breaking down barriers between Member States was the first sign of something new that was starting to take shape: no more barriers but unity; no more controls but solidarity between states, which are no longer divided but united in a single great Union. That is why it is odd to hold this debate today. We seem to have taken a step backwards and it appears that we are abandoning the foundations of our fine Union. If Schengen fails, the European Union fails, but if Schengen is so important it should be protected, as precious things are. It should be protected from a Council that thinks it can bypass Parliament’s prerogatives, but it should also be protected from anything that can call Schengen itself into question. External border control should therefore be strengthened with all the legislative and technological instruments we have because, if our borders are at risk of becoming porous, this automatically makes our Member States less flexible, and they could call for stricter control, even within our borders, to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants. We cannot allow that and for that I thank Commissioner Malmström for all her work and her future collaboration on this issue. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on macro-regional strategies, especially with regard to the Mediterranean. Macro-regions have given a good account of themselves, which is why, at an historic time such as this, the Mediterranean, too, needs to be given a major development boost. The Mediterranean can become a place where culture, education, training, tourism, trade, environmental protection, transport and fishing can all come together to make this area take off, in conjunction with the ensuing Arab Spring. Tourism brings wealth, as does trade; education brings democracy and job creation; while culture, with its artists, shows us how we are all united and gives us a view of what we could become. All these factors make the Mediterranean important, particularly for all the other areas of Europe and the Middle East in general. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we decided to table this oral question because the issue is particularly important. We have always strived to bring citizens closer to the EU institutions. We do so in many ways, through the visitors to Parliament, through our local actions, using all the means of communication that our timescales allow us. We do this with constant echoes in all our resolutions; we do so, too, with the Commission’s public consultations. The Commission often uses these consultations to form the basis of their communications to Parliament and other EU institutions. In other words, the Commission bases its work on the responses it gets. Where, then, is the problem? The problem is that often, the results of these consultations are objectively embarrassing. A few dozen answers, sometimes even just single figures, representing the half a billion citizens that make up the European Union. Truly embarrassing. In 2011, the Commission had already committed to reviewing its consultation policy but to date, that is, mid-2012, we have neither seen nor heard anything. It is not a matter of lengthening timescales: we could even do it for 365 days, but the results would be the same. One of the most obvious problems is the use of languages. We very seldom go beyond the use of English, and hardly ever use any other languages apart from English, French and German. My mother could never take part in the consultations because she does not know any of the three languages in question and many of our citizens are in a similar position to her. It is not just a matter of ignorance, it is also a matter of the values we believe in and on which we have based our Union. Multilingualism, Commissioner, is one of them. Of course it is important to be competent in languages, but we have 23 of them, and why should a Portuguese, an Italian or a Lithuanian not find out about the Commission’s consultation in their own language? Of course, the lack of answers does not only depend on language but we have to start somewhere. Language is not only a great place to start but, Commissioner, also becomes a priority because, if we were to continue in this way, we might just as well make savings at the root by abolishing this instrument since we are making such a terrible impression. I want to conclude with a question to you, Commissioner: if you were in charge of a communication company, would the results of this communication satisfy you and your company? Marco Scurria,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this resolution is very important because, until just a few months ago, volunteering was an object of mystery for the European Union. Even though it involved 100 million volunteers responsible for 5% of GDP, the sector did not actually appear to exist. Then, despite a series of difficulties, we managed to dedicate last year, 2011, to volunteering and we all began to pick up on its excellent potential. Member States that did not have legislation on this issue have adopted legislation, others have updated theirs, many have increased the activities carried out by voluntary associations and, especially at a time of crisis like the one we are experiencing, have assigned an important role – a subsidiary role, as it is referred to – to the non-profit world. We started off from this point to accentuate the role of volunteering in the European Union, as shown by the report we are debating this evening. We started off with an excellent communication from the Commission, whom I thank for their work, as I thank the shadow rapporteurs and officials of the groups and Parliament who helped me draw up the report. What have we set out? First, a portal to tell citizens about the volunteering opportunities in various Member States and how to get involved. Next, use of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Manual on the Measurement of Volunteer Work and the United Nations Handbook on Non-Profit Institutions with a view to making available comparable statistics and data providing a clear picture of the significant contribution made by volunteering and of the needs of volunteers throughout the European Union. We want to give volunteering a high profile in sport, particularly at the grassroots level. We would like to recognise the important contribution also made by volunteering to protecting the environment, and to support volunteering activities in environmental education, crisis prevention and management, as well as in defending artistic and cultural heritage. We support the Commission’s proposal to establish a European Skills Passport, so that the skills acquired through volunteering may be officially recognised, both for professional and for learning purposes. A passport that should be a comprehensive document listing all practical experience, training and soft and vocational skills acquired through lifelong learning, including those gained through volunteering, if desired by the volunteer. We urge the Commission to put this European Skills Passport in place as soon as possible. We also support the Commission’s proposal to create a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which will increase the participation of volunteers in solidarity actions in the context of the humanitarian aid policy throughout the EU. We wish to ensure adequate and stable funding and establish and simplify administrative procedures, including tax incentives, for the organisations involved in volunteering work, including associations and networks, particularly for small associations with limited resources, with a view to enhancing their roles, activities and achievements as they provide such benefits to society. As Henry de Montherlant used to say, ‘Selfless acts are the stars of the earth’. Volunteering work has this capability. With its activity, provided free of charge, it can bring the stars onto our earth and plant them firmly into the soil. Our flag, Mr President, is made up of stars, which is why the EU must not fail to strengthen the voluntary sector and its world made up of great little everyday gestures. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I think it is a positive first step towards bringing order to EU-China relations, which are clearly imbalanced. The EU is founded on certain fundamental values. For example, we rightly ask our businesses to respect the environment; we give importance to workers’ rights, first and foremost, women’s rights; we do not make children work; and we do not have concentration camps with free labour. In China, however, all this protection and these rights do not exist. Far from it! There are still barriers to European goods accessing the Chinese market, and goods are clearly produced there at a lower cost, resulting in unfair competition with European companies and goods. We must establish true reciprocity in relations with countries outside the EU so that, where there are causes for imbalance, they are offset by financial and trade provisions that safeguard our businesses and our goods. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think there could be a better day on which to hold this debate. Today is Europe Day, when we celebrate the idea of uniting 27 countries to date, creating a single market, a common currency for many of our Member States, ongoing cultural and educational exchange; an exchange, in short, of feelings of greater togetherness and closeness. What medium unites us more these days than that of communication? A single internal telecommunications market cannot, in fact, be said to exist without telecommunications and if significant differences remain between domestic and roaming prices. Therefore, the ultimate aim we have set ourselves is also the hypothetical one of being able to eliminate the difference between domestic charges and roaming charges, thus establishing an internal market for mobile communications services. It is one of the aims that we must set ourselves. In this way, competition will improve, and people will be protected. It is an economic saving, because high roaming charges always constitute an impediment to the Union’s efforts to develop into a knowledge-based economy and to the realisation of an internal market of 500 million consumers. That is not all. The creation of a European social, educational, cultural and entrepreneurial area, based on the mobility of individuals and digital data, should facilitate communication between people in order to attain our aim, which is to build a real ‘Europe for Citizens’. For these reasons, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for her skill and her great capabilities at mediation, but most of all, for having attained the aims that have been achieved, given the importance of this issue. Obviously, I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are here because – as we have also heard here in this House – we are also celebrating our Europe, an institution created to bring together what are now 27 countries, to create a single market, to give some of these countries a single currency, and to bring together countries with the same vision and the same plans for the future, for culture, education, and much more. One of the key words of this Union is solidarity. Today, the basis for this debate is what has happened in Sicily, what has happened in Lampedusa, including in recent months. However, this situation is clearly not restricted to Sicily or Lampedusa alone; it is something that concerns Malta, and has concerned and still concerns Spain. Consequently, if this solidarity does unite 27 countries and wants to unite 27 countries, it must be seen and it must be felt. It is a solidarity that sometimes has not been felt by these countries, which sometimes have felt alone and abandoned when it comes to quite serious problems taking place on their coasts. Today, however, we need to develop these aspects, we need to develop the tools that allow us to monitor our coastlines, and we also need to establish bilateral agreements with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, agreements that will allow us to avoid migration flows of vast proportions. We have seen that this system is the one that works the best, that also gives people the chance to retain their dignity, not to have to flee the countries where they were born, and also not to deprive the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean of such human and professional riches. Accordingly, if we are to celebrate this Europe, let us celebrate it also by remembering the reasons that make us united, that bring us together, and also that allow us to have a better dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Italians, we are obviously particularly sensitive to this issue. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and the Commission for its words, especially its references to the clause and issue of defamation. This is an important report, because the rapporteur has managed to find the right balance between personal freedom, privacy and legal certainty. Often, too often, we see examples of defamation, sometimes truly unwarranted, thanks also to the freedom of information offered by new technologies – the Internet in particular – with what are effectively invasions of people’s privacy. Therefore, I think that the idea of setting up and creating a centre for resolving or acting as a point of reference in disputes is truly a choice that represents both freedom and the rigour that we were all expecting. I also look forward to hearing what the Commission has to tell us about this in the future, also because today, perhaps too many things have been left unresolved. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 The economic crisis – and its consequences in terms of the imposition of austerity measures and budget cutbacks – demographic changes, rapid technological change and the resulting demand for new skills pose serious challenges to, and call for far-reaching reforms in, Europe’s higher education systems, which must not have a detrimental effect on the quality of education. In a knowledge-based society, the future hinges on education, research and innovation. This report marks a step towards implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which states that, by 2020, at least 40% of 30-34 year-olds in Europe should complete higher education or equivalent studies, given the estimate that 35% of all jobs in the EU will require such qualifications.

 I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress achieved by Turkey, especially in underlining the critical issues that are still unresolved. As mentioned in paragraph 11, it is of primary importance that Turkey should have a modern and efficient, fully independent and impartial judicial system, guaranteeing due process of law for all citizens. The growing number of new applications to the European Court of Human Rights shows that the objective has not yet been reached. For the purposes of modernisation, the issue raised in paragraph 29 also seems fundamental. The government must (is called upon to) take all the necessary measures to increase the social inclusion of women and their competitiveness in the labour market, especially through policies aiming to diminish the gender gap specifically in secondary education. It is even more important to mention here that Turkey’s military occupation of the northern part of the island of Cyprus without any legitimate claim has been in place ever since 1974.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this seems like a film from the past. We had thought that by now, piracy was something that only related to the Internet and issues concerning copyright and similar issues, instead of which, piracy is precisely what we know about from books and films of adventure. Obviously, the modern incarnation involves boarding a ship with machine guns and rocket launchers, not scimitars, and quite honestly, my left-wing friends, it has nothing to do with class war. It is irresponsible to claim that pirates exist because of capitalist exploitation. There are no justifications for attacking, stealing and killing – and to say so means to be complicit in such crimes. It is a tragic problem, and it is even more tragic when the people protecting the ships in accordance with international law are arrested by the authorities of other countries duplicitously in clear violation of international law, as was the case recently with the two Italian soldiers in India, or rather in international waters, who were then taken to harbour in India. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the comments made this evening in the Chamber, also because I hope that protecting the law is truly one of the EU’s main priorities. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Berlinguer’s report on the Bologna process. The creation of an open European Higher Education Area has been a major achievement for all of us. Even more important is the need to harmonise the recognition of degrees and the qualification framework, as well as the complete revision of the national systems of quality assurance in university teaching. We still have students today who gain degrees through Erasmus that are subsequently not recognised by their own universities or only allow enrolment in universities that are too different and sometimes even of questionable standing. This is why we need to reinforce the process, in order to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of increased employment and economic recovery, based also on improved cooperation between universities and the world of business and work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not understand why we take so much pleasure in harming ourselves. You have spoken about Morocco as an important partner on a human level, while many of us have already mentioned that Morocco is an imperialist state that occupies land illegally, in which the United Nations has not succeeded in holding a referendum. You have spoken about democratic links with Morocco. Well, in Morocco 22% of the population has the vote, it is one of the countries with the greatest illiteracy levels, farmers and fishermen do not have the right to form trade-unions there and everything is in the hands of the King. You have spoken about convenience for farmers. It is a pity that no European farmers have noticed this convenience, as you are well aware. Explain to me why we are asking our farmers and fishermen to comply with rules that do not apply to those who fish and farm outside of Europe but who are allowed to export their products into Europe. Commissioner, please tell me why democracy is valid for all but sometimes does not seem to apply at home. Marco Scurria,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to renew my best wishes and my compliments to the President for his new position. I wanted to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fisas Ayxela, for doing an excellent job: it is a really comprehensive report which sends out an important signal in the field of sport. The rapporteur has worked well, including with all the shadow rapporteurs, and of course I thank them too for the result. Finally, I also wish to send my greetings to Commissioner Vassiliou. Moreover, it really is a good sign that we are holding this debate and have completed this report in the year when the Olympics will be taking place, the crowning moment for sport worldwide, a time when sport turns into a vehicle for the global exchange of values and friendship. For this reason, we have stressed that sport is a tool for combating discrimination, bearing in mind how difficult it still is, for example, for women to play sports in some countries, such as Iran, which therefore worries us not only because of its decisions on nuclear power. Another significant factor is the idea of supporting the designation of a European capital of sport under the leadership of ACES, the European Capitals of Sport Association. As we have learnt from the European Capitals of Culture, the promotion of activities for the young and old is at its height under such initiatives. The report also includes the fight against doping, a focus on gambling and the rediscovery of traditional games. I think, in short, that we have done a good job in terms of honouring as far as possible the EU’s new competence in sport under the Treaty of Lisbon. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Today I thought that we had changed the order of business, and from the tone and arguments I thought we had decided to talk about President Assad’s Syria rather than a European Member State. I have heard talk about citizens who are afraid to live in Hungary, about a ‘black plague’ knocking on the doors of the EU, about a constitution that is a knife to the throat of minorities, and more. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about Venezuela here. I have seen Mr Orbán, a prime minister, who has come to explain his version to us, and says he will comply with whatever the EU decides. We have to believe him because he has already done so with the law on the mass media. So why all this fuss? Perhaps not because we are really that interested in the institutional and constitutional aspects of the affair, but because we do not share Mr Orbán’s political choices regarding the family, the state and opposing strong powers, and the influence of the banks on political decisions. We must be very careful. We do not have the right to interfere with the internal affairs of the Hungarian people. All we can do is check compliance with the Treaties, and I think this is what Mr Orbán is here to do. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton stated that repression must come to an end in Syria and the phase of transition should begin. However, we are all wondering how this could actually come about: it is true that sanctions have become harsher, although we need to step them up further to make them more effective, but at the same time, the regime does not even listen to the Arab League any more. Therefore what is and what might become our future role? I think that Baroness Ashton’s efforts should, above all, focus on putting huge pressure on the UN, China and Russia, because if President Assad feels he has support in China and Russia, he will not feel isolated. The role these two nations are playing in the United Nations is truly objectionable, as is the funding that the European Union bestowed upon Syria – or rather on President Assad – until a few months ago. Was he not a dictator before now? Has he only just started depriving his country of freedom and democracy? We therefore need to step away from this concept of political correctness, in which anyone who does business with us is automatically considered worthy of financial concessions and a relationship with the European Union.

 In order to tackle youth unemployment in the EU, we need to implement a series of measures such as extending compulsory education to the age of 18 and creating ‘second chance’ schools. These schools would have teachers, psychologists and trainers to allow young people in situations of difficulty, poverty and early failure, also brought about by an excessively rigid existing education system, to be reintegrated into the education system with flexible learning programmes sensitive to their interests and extra-curricular pastimes. In the face of youth unemployment affecting one in five young people, reducing early school leaving by 1% would suffice to produce 500 000 qualified young workers. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, 52% of young people who leave school without qualifications remain unemployed. In order to guarantee Europe, which is in the grip of the economic crisis and rising migration, the concrete possibility of a return to growth and social cohesion, I believe it is crucial to focus on knowledge and suitable levels of education. The reform of the education system must involve partnerships between schools and local enterprises in order to offer students a better careers service. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first and foremost, to thank Ms Paliadeli for the patient work she has carried out in producing the second reading of this provision in collaboration with the other rapporteurs, including my colleague, Ms Sanchez-Schmid. Contrary to what was has been said of late, I am very convinced by this provision – because we can have different ideas and between us we can think things that are clearly different, but if we are here, we are here because we believe in the European Union and we believe in certain values that the Union has established and has seen emerge. These values are the fruits of a common history created by so many individual components in our own nations, in our own cities and in our own lands, but which have then shaped a common civilisation, history, identity and tradition. There is no need to rewrite history to say that Gdańsk was the gateway to the liberty and democracy of a large part of Europe. There is no need to call out the English soldiers who fought in the Second World War, because they were not fighting solely for England’s sake but to bring back liberty and democracy to the whole of Europe. There is no need to recount that this label comes at a price, as with anything of importance. In reality, this is a price which is comparatively small compared to so much of what we support, because by means of this provision, our territory will have factories, houses, libraries, historical centres, castles and places of worship that will remind us, in the diversity of our lands of origin and our nations, that we are children of the same culture, that we are children of the same land which we call Europe, and that, perhaps, if we always return to look at these places, we will find the answers to so many of the problems that trouble our Union today.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is never appropriate to rank crimes in order: they are all, clearly, despicable. However, the crimes we are talking about this evening are especially contemptible. Perhaps it is not by chance that one of the harshest pages of the Gospel is the one where Jesus says: ‘Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.’ Rarely are the words of Christ more damning. Some days, you go home pleased at having done a good job: today is one of those days. Thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, and to the other European institutions, the Commission and the Council, we are launching an important piece of legislation that includes: measures against sex tourism; a clear definition of the crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation, and of child pornography, as well as the aggravating circumstances; a guarantee of as much free psychological help for victims as each case requires; a decision on the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of these crimes; a focus on prevention; and much else besides. Even these days, when anti-politics seems to have the upper hand, politics is able to provide a clear and tangible response, in the first instance for the benefit of the many associations and volunteers who deal with these issues on a daily basis and for the police forces that carry out a highly sensitive and extremely valuable job which, in some countries including my own – Italy – has reached standards of genuine excellence and constitute examples to be followed. Today the important thing was to produce a European strategy to make our citizens feel that the Union is there for them, especially on such crucial issues as these. We can be quite secure and proud in saying that we have succeeded in doing so. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the minute I have to speak, I would certainly like to thank Ms Gardini for the excellent report she has drafted, not least because it comes out of discussions with the competent institutions and the associations working in this area. However, we need more than that. We need a legislative resolution that can go a step further and organise civil protection across Europe with no more gaps and no more overlaps. At a time when the role of the European Union is being debated, this is an area in which there is a demand for more Europe in order to develop united, coordinated action by the whole EU, particularly because civil protection depends on solidarity and volunteering. That fits in nicely with the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon and the current European Year of Volunteering. A financial instrument is needed as well, of course, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing this out and requesting an increased budget. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 The amendment to the Frontex Regulation was a necessity given ever increasing illegal immigration within the borders of the European Union. In this light, setting up teams of European border guards particularly helps a number of Member States to manage huge and sudden migratory flows, such as those that took place following the Arab revolts. At the same time, the procedures for the most vulnerable categories – above all, unaccompanied minors – represent the other side of this measure, where respect for the law and solidarity intersect to guarantee both human rights and the security of the Member States. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Syrian poet, Adonis, has written an open letter to President Assad in which he addresses the President and says that no one believes that democracy can be instituted in Syria immediately after the fall of the current regime; rather, it is unbelievable and unrealistic for Syria to continue the systematic violence to re-establish order. He adds that that is the problem and that it is necessary to lay the foundations of democracy from the outset, now, and not tomorrow. He then says that, on the other hand, without democracy, there will only be a retreat to the abyss. The ‘abyss’ the poet is talking about is growing larger every day in Syria: people filming are being shot, children of even 11 years of age are being imprisoned, some army officials are starting to become discontented and starting to desert. Many would follow them if they could more easily cross the borders with neighbouring states. Even today, the Corriere della Sera
, in analysing the situation in Syria, states that in Syria, the protest is not abating, Assad is not stepping down and the world does not see. Baroness Ashton, Europe is the only institution that can show the world what is actually happening; it is the only institution that can make a real gesture, that can help, but, above all, provide a prospect for the future. It is time to invest in the Mediterranean, thus choosing to envisage a world of peace and stability for the future. It is time for courage and for the European flag, as Adonis told us, to fly in Benghazi as a sign for the whole Mediterranean region. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to vote for this report because it sets out some fundamental elements for cohesion policy and for funding. These are, firstly, leaner procedures for national funds, and, secondly, the provision that sport and culture are also an element of cohesion that is both important and decisive. Perhaps the only negative element of this report is that it envisages only the three working languages of English, French and German as the languages that need to accompany the request in addition to the original language. For this reason, in any case, and for more general reasons I voted in favour and I congratulate the rapporteur. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, to be honest, I did not want to participate in the discussion on the G8, but I did want to put a question to President Barroso regarding culture. In the European Union, there are many programmes to encourage youngsters – and others – to meet, so that this becomes a real Union. For many youngsters and professionals, programmes such as Comenius, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action, etc. have represented the true coming-together of the European Union, inspiring truly European sentiments. (The President interrupted the speaker to explain that the debate was on another subject, but then invited him to continue …)
 I would like to know, therefore, what is to become of these programmes, at least as far as the Commission can tell, seeing that they are approaching their expiry dates and we should already have confronted the matter within the Committee on Culture and Education. How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on? I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), all the rapporteurs who presented reports this morning, as I believe that these reports allow us to lay the foundations for the Europe of the future. This morning, we are working on future generations, from children to our young people, whom we must guide into the world of work by means of the important flagship initiative entitled Youth on the Move. This morning, we are discussing expanding the Union towards the Balkans through culture, as well as developing cultural and creative industries. At a time of great economic crisis, it is important to emphasise that the only sector not making a loss – in fact, its turnover is actually increasing – is the cultural sector. We would like culture to play a part in the external actions of the European Union, and not only, Lord Dartmouth and Mr Kuhn, through well paid officials, but rather by constructing a better process for peace, stability and understanding between different cultures. Today, though, we must also seek to strengthen our programmes for culture, education and young people. For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action,
 and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union’s existence. For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon. We need to invest in all these programmes but, above all, we need to believe in them. Nobody is denying the importance of milk quotas, investment in industry and protecting the environment; but it is culture that will allow us to build Europe, and we will have to do this not with words, but with programmes and actions that we are able and willing to put into practice. Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations. This is how Europe will be built, and at times it may even be necessary to bend those regulations a little. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Baroness Ashton for the report she has put before us today. However, I should like to point out to her that public opinion in Europe is unfortunately not aware of the European Union’s presence. As many of my fellow Members have also mentioned, our external policy is still in a rudimentary state, as can be seen from certain events that have happened in recent days. Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf: it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection. It is our duty to intervene in that part of the world, just as it is in Syria. This country is in a really very serious situation, in which human rights and the chance to oppose a dictatorial government must get the European Union interested … (The President cut off the speaker) Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Speaking a few days ago at a meeting of industrialists, Italy’s Minister for Finance, Mr Tremonti, coined a new phrase – the ‘nuclear debt’. The Member States that have invested in nuclear power are the ones with the highest levels of public debt. How much does it cost to close first- and second-generation power stations? How much do the stress tests, which we are discussing at such length today, cost? Once a power station is shown to be ‘stressed’, how much does it cost to ‘destress’ it? Furthermore, how much does it cost to dispose of radioactive waste? No one has yet told us. As the European Union, we could begin to think of different options to show the Member States. Moreover, given that the Commission will have to provide us with a road map, why not begin to think of real investment in fourth-generation nuclear power – clean nuclear, or fusion – or even begin to consider an overall energy plan? We expect the Commission Communication to outline a road map on this subject and to try to give the European Union a clear direction at last in this sector. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this point of the debate, practically everything has been said, and perhaps that is exactly the point. We continue to talk and, as we speak, the landings are continuing and people are dying at sea and crowding in inhumane conditions on the Italian and Maltese shores, which are not the shores of Italy and Malta, but the border of Europe, gateway to our European Union, through which any of our 27 Member States can be reached. The time for talk is over, we are told by our citizens and the migrants who sought freedom and found themselves locked in closed camps. It is time to act, Commissioner. I call on you; we call on you to take the lead as early as tomorrow, after our vote, and to send a request to the Council for the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and jointly establish a true strategy for the future of the Mediterranean, because at stake is not only Europe’s credibility but also its immediate fate. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure and pride that we are discussing this strategy here this evening: pleasure because Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job, for which I thank her, and pride because it is an initiative that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have very much wanted. It is an excellent report because, of course, it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the Roma, and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach. We like it because it not only sets out rights but also highlights certain needs. We also dealt with it in the opinion that we gave as the Committee on Culture and Education. I am thinking, in particular, about the whole part relating to schooling for Roma children, in which we point out that schooling is both a right and a duty, in which the children’s families must also be involved. I would also point out that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion. Alongside the promotion of Roma culture, it is also important to recognise that the Roma should make an effort to learn about the customs and culture of the peoples with whom they live, so as to facilitate real integration. Perhaps the only thing missing in this report is a reference to Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens. In this regard, we have been waiting for a long time for the Commission to give us an interpretation of how to put it into practice, and we now need to know what it is right and fair to expect the Member States to do. For everything else, I again thank the rapporteur for all that she has succeeded in doing. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking part in the discussion a little shamefacedly, because the Commissioner has more or less told us that it is pointless to conduct this debate because there is nothing to argue about. We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions – in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber – we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission’s views – and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union. Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps – no, definitely – because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place. Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow. More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus. Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens. I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for her work. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis should give us the impetus to find out whether the European Union really wants a foreign policy role. Foreign policy is a serious matter: it needs strategies, firm objectives and clear alliances. We cannot continue travelling around the world patting everyone on the back and pretending that everything is going well all the time. Elections took place in Egypt a few weeks ago and we did not get up in arms because we realised that there was a dictatorship that was fooling all of us. Now that millions of people have taken to the streets, we are all talking about democracy and human rights. This is what we want, and we will try to make sure it happens, but we should be careful about following the crowd. I remember when the Iranian people rose up to get rid of the Shah, and we know how that ended, with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now. I hope, for example, that the Egyptian Government will be able to keep extremists at bay and play a stabilising role in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Baroness Ashton, more democracy is certainly needed in that part of the world, but so is more European policy. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are tackling yet another debate on the violation of human rights and democracy in Iran. This time, it is the case of a lawyer who protects human rights activists in Iran. Indeed, the idea is to solve the problem at source by no longer merely imprisoning people who fight for their rights, but to go directly to those that defend them, just to show which way the wind is blowing for those who wish to oppose the Ahmadinejad regime. I would place a bet today, Mr President, that in a few weeks’ time, we will be back in this Chamber to speak about another different case of all basic rights being violated in Iran. The violation will be disguised by some criminal motive that would be laughable were it not so tragic, such as acting against national security or propaganda against the regime, as in the case we are discussing today. I really do wonder, Mr President, whether Parliament should continue to have a delegation for relations with a regime that is the exact opposite of everything the European Union is founded on. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic, which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli, and which we have turned into this oral question. From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem. There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children. However, these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless. Clearly, these children are our priority. They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires. However, when these children remain in care for too long, they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders. All this is happening whilst, meanwhile, many families would like to open their homes to these children. I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt. However, we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions, as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children, obviously. We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children, because in a few years’ time, these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Vassiliou and thank her for her strong backing for this initiative, just as I should like to thank Mrs Paliadeli and all the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done. Europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulties at present. Indeed, we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty. Obviously, that is an important thing to do, but Europe must not lose sight of the importance of the values that have allowed the Union to emerge victorious from the innumerable challenges it has had to deal with during its history. Europe’s wealth lies in its history, its culture, its art, its leading figures, its landscapes, its symbolic places, its intellectuals, its philosophers and – dare I say it – in its civilisation. This label can represent all of this and highlight all the myriad forms of European identity that the Member States have contributed over time. We must now look at the negotiations with the Council to resolve a few differences of interpretation on several points. I believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily, given the importance of this topic. I also believe that as soon as this report is definitively adopted, we shall all feel more European, due to the values and traditions we share. I believe that through the Commission, the work carried out by Parliament and with the Council, we really are doing a good job for all our citizens. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question from Mr Martin under Rule 149(8)) Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I am very happy to respond to Mr Martin because we know that the bureaucracy issue is sometimes what distinguishes and separates European citizens from their institutions. Seen from this point of view, I think the path set out by this report is quite clear. We shall also talk about it with the Council. Once the Member States have decided which sites the European label could be given to and once we have a panel of true experts coming together, who are given the chance to select the sites within a necessary but not excessive amount of time – and we still need to work out who will have the last word on this, but it is an issue that we shall have to discuss both with the Council and Commission – I do not see excessive bureaucratic issues from this point of view. There are bureaucratic issues for many other measures but not on this one regarding the label, which I think can easily be followed in a secure timeframe and with clear results for all European citizens. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other than the Commission, I should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier. What we are talking about today is important because it is an instrument like ‘Youth in Action’ that creates the spread of ideas, closeness and friendship amongst the countries of the European Union, but also, and above all, amongst those that are not part of it, such as Switzerland or other countries besides. It is the great richness of our multiannual programmes that, through actions such as ‘Youth in Action’, ‘Erasmus’, ‘Erasmus Mundus’, ‘Permanent Education’, ‘Media’, ‘Media Mundus’ and many others, they allow relationships to be built between the countries of the European Union and third countries. Through these programmes, you see, we have brought the European Union to life, allowing many citizens – primarily young people – to meet, swap experiences, come to know others and to become known themselves. We have given teachers and workers in general the chance to improve their professional skills and we have given directors, producers and associations of various countries the chance to do better work. Hence, these programmes are important and so we were a bit concerned when we did not see them on the Commission’s Work Programme for next year. Today, therefore, today we are approving an important step, which makes the EU grow, strengthens citizenship on our continent, and – given that we spoke about it a little while earlier regarding the European Heritage Label – it is a step that contributes to creating this European identity of ours. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, amongst friends one can speak frankly and tell things as they are. Hence, we are telling Morocco that it must do much more to resolve the Western Sahara situation. The European Union cannot continue, and could not continue, to pretend that it is all nothing, because we risk committing a serious error. We risk telling those who have chosen peace, like the Sahrawi people did through the Polisario Front, that they have chosen wrongly. Those who do not send suicide bombers, who do not carry out attacks, and who trust only in international organisations do not make the news. For these people the powers of the world do not come together. Madam President, that is not right, because the Sahrawi are a courageous but mild-mannered people, they live their religion in the right way and their women have important roles in society. The Sahrawi are fighting for their land, for which their love is as infinite as their desert; and they are fighting for their identity, and it is not right that they are left to themselves. The vote we have striven for tomorrow in this part-session is an important sign that the European Union is working to take a decisive role in the destiny of this area of land. Marco Scurria  (PPE

I hope that the actions identified in the Action Plan will be carried forward within the planned timeframe considering their importance for improving the lives of European citizens. In particular, Italy has always supported the need to develop mutual trust between Member States of the Union and is in favour of continuing to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. From this perspective, we strongly support the approach of the whole Action Plan, which hinges on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, to be achieved by strengthening mutual trust. I would also emphasise the need to use all possible means to foster a European judicial culture, particularly through legal teaching and training. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 I take this opportunity to emphasise that a humane society is necessarily based on the principle of justice between the generations, and that age discrimination jeopardises solidarity between the generations, leads to poverty and is forbidden by the founding treaties. Work is more than just paid employment and both young and older people contribute substantially, including through their work in the family, to making our society more humane and improving the stability of services and workplaces. In this report, we call on governments to facilitate and recognise voluntary work that provides care in the community and family care, and to resolve issues of legal responsibility in that regard without delay. I also applaud this report for calling on the Member States to adopt measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members, predominantly women, of all ages in caring for older and younger members, in the context of solidarity between generations. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 Italy is the country where enterprises suffer most due to late payment by public authorities, with an average period for payment to suppliers of 180 days as opposed to the European average of 67 days. This leads to financial problems, a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness, particularly for SMEs. The directive we have voted for today discourages debtors from paying late and allows creditors to protect their interests effectively against such lateness, introducing the right to legal interest caused by late payment even when not specified in the contract. It also forces public authorities to pay within a maximum of 60 days from the payment request, provided the service has been performed satisfactorily. The adoption of this directive is truly a great help for our enterprises: nowadays, one company in four closes down as a result of problems of insufficient financial liquidity. These new rules on payments will mean that companies will regain their market competitiveness and no jobs will be lost. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciated the Commissioner’s approach to this discussion, because she stated that there are essentially no real infringements in Europe and also because she reassured us about the Commission’s role as guardian of the treaties and therefore also of press freedom and freedom of expression in Europe. Certain dangers nevertheless still remain. The Commissioner noted that almost half of the countries belonging to the European Union are subject to infringement proceedings to find out whether press freedom and freedom of expression are really guaranteed there. She also highlighted the preventive measures that must be implemented in these areas, emphasising however, that the problem is not specific to one State or to individual States. It is obviously not an Italian problem – Parliament expressed itself on this subject a few months ago by taking a democratic vote – and neither is it a political party problem, because we have just heard that in Germany, it is the socialist group that controls certain media outlets. The problem we must face in this Chamber is more general. Tomorrow, we will vote on a report on journalism and new media – creating a public sphere in Europe. This report contains certain guidelines on which our Parliament is beginning to express its opinion. We must talk about how to combine truth and freedom in the new media, but also in the more traditional media, because while it is one’s right to tell all, it is also one’s duty to tell the truth when writing or expressing oneself through a media outlet. We must also understand how to combine information with the right of citizens – of all citizens – to privacy. These are the issues we must tackle and to which Parliament must confine itself, not ideologies or certain matters concerning things that do not exist in any European country. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who – as announced by President Buzek at the beginning of the session – has tendered his resignation from the European Parliament in order to take up duties in his own country, and to whom I send my regards and my best wishes, because he has done a great job. This report is the result of his intentions, and it was carried in our Committee on Culture and Education by an overwhelming majority, with just a single vote against, for which I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report, both on my behalf and on behalf of Mr Schmitt. Before leaving for Strasbourg, on Monday I went to Rome to visit a private training centre that is achieving superb results, because it has succeeded in placing the vast majority of young people that it trains over the course of time. When I spoke to the director of this centre, he said to me: ‘Please help us, you in Europe too, to follow this course, to add weight to training that moves in this direction, which enables so many young people to find work; help us also to modernise the relationship between universities and business.’ The thrust of this report lies precisely here: today, 20% of young Europeans are out of work, of whom about 30% are graduates; a percentage that is so high that we are forced to ask ourselves very seriously about how we should approach the issue of training young people for entry into the world of work in these times, in this Europe, in this globalised world. We have then, in this report, wished to address directly the issue of how to improve the link between universities and business, highlighting certain key points: first, by giving priority to one of the strong points available to the European Union, namely the ability of its citizens to adapt to the constantly changing circumstances of the labour market; the fact that there is no longer any such thing as a ‘job for life’, and that these days, training and retraining is essential. The first point then is lifelong learning; the second, which, in our view, is of fundamental importance, is that of mobility. These days it is important, as we highlight in this report, to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds, and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and Erasmus for Apprentices, but also the organisation of postgraduate European Masters of Excellence programmes, in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses. Furthermore, more entrepreneurial universities should be encouraged. Such a result can be achieved, for example, through the introduction of a system of knowledge vouchers such as that currently in use in a number of Member States, enabling SMEs, in particular, to improve their research capacity without compromising the independence, autonomy and public character of universities. The third key point is that of research, namely, we see greater researcher mobility – in both the short and long term, across nations and between academia and business – as imperative in enhancing knowledge transfer. Finally, the possibility of extending the good practices in this area that exist in so many countries. I shall conclude, Madam President, by illustrating, in relation to this report and the outstanding work done by the committee, how convinced we are that Europe will not win the battle against China or other developing nations by means of low wages, but by having highly qualified professionals and highly competitive businesses, and in this process, it is of maximum importance that universities and businesses realise how they are interdependent, and that the authorities at all levels contribute to developing more efficient methods of cooperation. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish again to thank the Commission for its communication, which we have adopted for the most part. I should just like to dwell on a perhaps critical aspect that has emerged in this debate, because someone emphasised how fundamental the independence of universities, freedom of research and public financing are. We are all agreed on this, and that is why I fail to understand these critical remarks, because it is enough to read the report, where, in the very first paragraphs, we have written very clearly and stress that the intellectual and financial independence of higher education institutions vis-à-vis business must be maintained and no relations of dependency on business must arise on the part of higher education. It also emphasises that universities should, in all circumstances, maintain the autonomy to decide over their curricula and governance structures. This dispels any problems or doubts whatsoever in this area, which is why I do not understand what these problems could be, unless it is a question of old-fashioned ideological exploitation. Let us accordingly really give some thought to this, since this report sets out the conditions for effectively improving the lot of our young people and our students, because there is truly no one who wants to leave hundreds of thousands of youngsters in the hands of who knows what business purposes but, on the contrary, only wants hundreds of thousands of students to have the opportunity of studying, training and working in the society that awaits them. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to contribute to this debate because we are preparing to vote for what I believe to be an extremely important measure: it is important to rationalise the work of our enterprises, but especially to protect consumers. Those who buy must know what they are buying, and those who seek quality must find quality! However, it is also important to have an idea of the social sustainability of what we are buying. Someone has already said this – but I want to stress it again because I think that this is a specific point that must emerge from this discussion in the European Parliament – I want to know whether a given product is made in a place where workers are protected; I want to know whether that product involves the exploitation of children; I want to know whether that product is the result of unfair competition. So here we have a measure that I hope will soon be extended to other manufacturing and craft sectors, because I believe and conclude that this measure will bring Europe much closer to its citizens, and for this I thank the rapporteurs who have brought this measure into being, and the Commission and Commissioner Tajani for being a driving force behind it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something because, as was mentioned previously, the Italian Embassy and other embassies were attacked yesterday in Tehran. Because of this, Parliament and the Union should also consider expressing their solidarity, formally if possible, with our country and all the countries involved in this attack. We should also send out clear signals, though, and I therefore officially request that Europe should not be present at the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran and that this should be a clear signal sent by us to the Iranian authorities. I am also saying this on a special day for Italians, because today is the Day of Remembrance. This is the reason I, like many Italians – including you I hope, Mr President – wear this tricolour rosette in memory of the many Italians who were cast out on this day and forced to leave their own lands. Through this act of remembrance, I would like to express our solidarity for those who are struggling for democracy and freedom in Iran. For this reason, I call on our authorities not to go to the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Republic. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in European Union publications and on EU websites, we often say that human rights are the heart of the process of European integration and the key element of its external relations. The countries that have entered into political or trade agreements with the European Union are bound to respect these rights. Baroness Ashton, we ought to ask ourselves whether these requirements still exist in our relations with Iran and whether it really makes sense for us to send a delegation to Tehran without agreeing a programme with the Iranian Government which both sides endorse, one which will allow us to listen to the arguments and voices of the opposition, too. With regard to what we can do, we must, however, be careful even about talking of sanctions, because history shows that economic and trade sanctions have often strengthened regimes instead of weakening them, and that they have, in fact, weakened the people and, above all, the poorest of them. When we listened to certain people as a delegation, and heard testimony regarding the rights of women and minorities in Iran, they told us that perhaps it would be better to impose symbolic sanctions, such as cultural sanctions. In recent days, many representatives and intellectuals throughout Europe have been writing to call for UNESCO not to hold World Philosophy Day in Tehran. I think that this could be a commitment taken on by this Parliament too, remembering that Neda Agha-Soltan was a student with a degree in philosophy, and that this symbol could unite the European Parliament as it calls upon UNESCO to take this action.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to thank Parliament, all the committees, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. We have prepared a report which raises the profile of the voluntary sector. There are 100 million people throughout Europe who work in this field, and each day they selflessly give their time for the good of others and our community. This is the work we have done, increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU-wide activities for the benefit of the associations. I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič and the Swedish Presidency for the excellent work we have accomplished together. I think that this year will mark the beginning of Parliament showing a true interest in this area, which someone called the backbone of our society. Once again, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this important report. Potito Salatto  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not join my Italian colleagues in asking the EU to intervene to protect the two Italian soldiers because I believe that this should instead be the duty of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as it concerns two European citizens of Italian origin. Unless, in this Chamber and our institutions, we do not make the cultural shift that will require the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to take care of our citizens, especially when international rules have been flouted – the most basic of which is that a ship in international waters is subject to the jurisdiction of the flag it is flying – we will never manage to give Parliament a significant role at international level. This would cause serious damage and continue to leave foreign policy to be implemented by individual Member States, rather than creating the supranational state of Europe that citizens are crying out for. I was amazed when Baroness Ashton initially replied to calls for explanations from Italian fellow Members by saying that, ‘We did not receive any requests from the Italian Government’. Moreover, this evening, you, Commissioner, also introduced the issue saying ‘We are acting at the request of the Italians’. This is the wrong cultural and political approach. We are a great nation, a great continent, and we have to take care of our European citizens regardless of their nationality wherever they are, taking action to safeguard them in accordance with international law. I hope that sooner or later, Baroness Ashton will be capable of making this cultural shift. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out quickly to this House that the Bureau gave the green light for the European delegation for relations with Iran to travel to Tehran, subject to a few conditions. May I just point out that only the other day Iran’s Minister for Relations with the European Union officially declared that he did not accept the conditions for the visit, meaning that we cannot take action. I would ask you to revise this stance. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of what has just been said, I and my Italian colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Delegation for relations with Iran are absolutely opposed to this trip to Iran and ask the Bureau, which had decided to give the go-ahead, to re-think this action, which simply gives free publicity to the government in Tehran.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, aside from this issue, I should like to submit a problem to the Presidency. I think some people have not yet fully understood the role of the European Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon. I feel I must point out an underlying problem here: the Commissioner for Transport, Mr Kallas, has repeatedly refused to meet with the board of the Sky and Space Intergroup to discuss the Cost-Effective Small Aircraft (CESAR) project, which affects everyone in terms of the economy, the environment and security. I would urge the Presidency to call Commissioner Kallas to this Chamber to explain the programme he intends to move ahead with in this sector, which is extremely sensitive and important for the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to carry on listing the reasons for our disagreement with the Iranian Government. Since it has not been referred to here, I will only emphasise one of the most serious violations of civil rights, which relates to young people. The Iranian Government, having signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, nonetheless continues to impose capital punishment on minors. After this debate, I would like, firstly, Baroness Ashton, to take on the task of setting out a common approach for Europe as a whole and the European Parliament as a whole on events in Iran and, secondly, the inter-parliamentary delegation for relations with Iran to note that it must change its line. I, together with my friends Mr Scurria and Mr Tatarella, protested to the delegation: in an official statement, it stated that it wanted to visit Iran in any case, even though it had made a peremptory request to have the opportunity to meet and talk to the opposition. From now on, I would like the delegation to start singing from a new hymn sheet and to sustain relations of assistance, support and debate with the exiled representatives of the opposition, not least Mrs Myriam Rajavi, who typifies this situation. This is what the European Union should be doing, rather than imposing sanctions. Potito Salatto  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Jazłowiecka’s report, which lets us take an important step forward in the current debate on the economic recovery of individual Member States. While balancing the Member States’ budgets is a priority on the one hand, targeted social investment is also needed to prepare individuals, families and businesses for the change of economic climate and the demands of the employment market. As well as the sustainability of public finances, the Member States should also be focusing on how to create sustainable, quality jobs, on how to invest in training and updating of skills, and on fighting poverty and social exclusion. Hence the need for, and perhaps urgency of, a coordinated approach to social investment and therefore a Social Investment Pact for the whole of Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Mr Becker’s report, which provides a better framework for the contribution of social businesses to solving the current crisis. Social enterprises are unfortunately often seen as a sort of appendage to traditional forms of business, based exclusively on the maximisation of profit. Social enterprises, on the other hand, have a fundamental role to play in the development of markets and the European economy. They enable innovative responses to be made to economic, social and environmental challenges, through sustainable development, social inclusion and territorial cohesion. I therefore support the proposal to set up a Social Entrepreneurship Fund, which meets the primary objective of not exposing these businesses to unregulated competition, guaranteeing them adequate financial support and facilitating their market integration.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at a time when, for some nostalgic nationalists, speaking of closer European integration sounds provocative, we are about to vote on amendments to a regulation which forms the basis for the difficult but necessary process of harmonising and bringing closer together the national legal systems. Allow me therefore to congratulate Mr Zwiefka on the excellent work carried out and his success – after around two years of difficult negotiations – in bringing to a close the process of revising a regulation which has been of fundamental importance to citizens of the Union. Brussels I in fact establishes provisions which are of the utmost importance in ensuring sufficient access to justice and equality of treatment before all the courts which have competence in the European Union. It sets up common standards in civil and commercial matters, clarifying which Court has competence in a cross-border dispute, and making the sentences issued enforceable in the different States. The amendments made to the regulation are required in order to put into practice the wish to create a European area for justice which promotes judicial certainty and predictability of decisions, thus making transnational trade easier and strengthening the single market. That said, I believe that progress towards an ever deeper harmonisation of the standards of substantive law must proceed with the appropriate caution and attention in order to ensure certainty of law and to protect less favoured parties. For this reason, I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur in favour of consumers, who will benefit from the principle of protection for the weaker party. A basic principle under which, in a legal dispute between consumers and businesses, the consumer will always be able to choose a court in the Member State of his or her residence. Similarly, I share the prudent approach taken by Mr Zwiefka regarding the abolition of the exequatur
: while on the one hand abolishing the exequatur
 would allow recognition of sentences to be speeded up at a later stage, on the other I believe that measures for safeguarding defendants’ rights must be maintained. It is therefore necessary for defendants to have the possibility of contesting a decision if their right to a fair trial has been breached and if the decision goes against ordre public
 in the reference State. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my compliments to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. I hope we shall reach broad interinstitutional and political consensus on a regulation which forms the template not only for cooperation in the civil courts but also for political determination based on the process of European integration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very satisfied with the report by Ms Bastos, on which I voted in favour. Unfortunately, the severe economic crisis in Europe has had a negative impact on perceptions of the single market’s potential, among both citizens and businesses, and some governments and national political movements. There is a danger that this will cloud our vision of the excellent work done by the European institutions to revitalise and strengthen the single market, for example the wide-ranging public procurement reform and the revision of the Late Payments Directive. I agree that there is a need, as Ms Bastos has stressed, to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation between the European Union and the Member States. Fundamental measures – such as the setting up of unitary patent protection – are all too often blocked or delayed by institutional conflict and national egotism. In a period of crisis like the current one, we need to take a united approach to governance, one which enables us to introduce the necessary legislation promptly, to revitalise the internal market and strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, almost two decades have passed since the concept of European Citizenship was legally established, but still only 43 % of EU citizens claim familiarity with the term ‘citizen of the European Union’. They lack information and awareness of their rights: language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications are among the most common problems that EU citizens face on a daily basis. I therefore agree with the Commission’s initiative to declare 2013 the Year of European Citizens. I also fully support the rapporteur’s wish to have the scope of application of the Decision widened to focus on enhancing the awareness of citizens in order to allow them to make full use of their rights, and not just their right to move and reside freely. I also hope that the Year of European Citizens will not be another celebratory year but rather provide the foundation for a framework for the future policies, measures and actions needed to reinforce Union citizenship. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, it is clear that if the European Union wishes to emerge from the crisis, it should enhance the competitiveness of its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are responsible for the creation of 85 % of all new jobs in the EU. It is therefore necessary to harmonise national industrial polices to a greater degree, while it is also essential to achieve another objective: internationalisation of SMEs. Only 25 % of SMEs in the European Union have been internationally active within the single market. I therefore agree with the actions proposed by the Commission aimed at encouraging the process of internationalisation and the need expressed by the rapporteur for provision of specific information about priority markets together with details of the various support services available. In conclusion, I would underline the need for greater coordination of the various initiatives at EU level. At a time of rationalisation of public spending, we cannot afford to duplicate efforts or policies, risking the creation of pointless administrative and bureaucratic burdens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg and my fellow Members who, through their excellent work, have helped to bring to life one of the key actions of the Digital Agenda for Europe. The directive we are shortly to approve will help achieve two fundamental goals in the development of European copyright. First of all, it will enable the dissemination and enjoyment of works that otherwise would have risked disappearance from our cultural heritage. This initiative therefore fulfils one of the undisputed cardinal rules of copyright, namely, the protection and promotion of culture and intellectual creations. Secondly, this directive will make it possible to modernise and improve Member States’ legal frameworks by bringing existing legislation into line with technical developments and the need for greater flexibility. This will help boost the economic benefits of copyright by ensuring fair remuneration for work and identifying any rights holders under an absolutely solid regulatory framework. Turning to the use of orphan works for commercial purposes, I support the approach taken by this House, which allows commercial use solely in order to pay for the costs associated with the public service carried out by the various relevant institutions. Indeed, the directive does not address issues relating to profit-seeking utilisation of orphan works, but rather legitimate and cross-border access to such works, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity and depth of Europe’s cultural heritage.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we find ourselves debating the political situation of a country that since 2007 has been an EU Member State, and one that has been meeting its obligations under the acquis communautaire
. Among the legal requirements and political objectives that unite and bind together the Members of the Union, the rule of law is an indispensable prerequisite for the democratic organisation of society. That is why it is so important to debate the current situation in Romania, which is taking on worrying proportions as a result of a power struggle and an unprecedented war between its institutions. In this conflict a majority has tried to take over and dominate all the other bodies, including the Constitutional Court, the judiciary and the other institutions, and bend them to its will, while overstepping and sweeping away the balance between the powers, offices and institutions. It is strange that a certain part of this Parliament that always takes an interest in the level of democracy and freedom in the countries that make up the Union appears indifferent on this occasion or is even trying to justify the situation. I think this House and the Commission would do well to keep a very close eye on what is happening in Romania. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr Turmes’s report, which paves the way for adoption of a directive that will finally make it possible to overcome the differences between Member States with regard to energy efficiency. Though it does not change the non-binding nature of the goal of energy efficiency set by the climate and energy package of 2008, the directive imposes on suppliers and distributors compulsory annual saving schemes in terms of final consumption. According to the Commission’s figures, the measure will bring about a total saving of around EUR 20 billion in the costs of investment in energy generation and distribution. This is vitally important and will help reaffirm the Union as a global player, since the future geopolitical balance will be primarily decided by policies on the supply and use of energy resources.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, whom I thank for the excellent quality of his work and for his valuable suggestions. Despite the ongoing harmonisation of standards of protection and asylum, we still have a long way to go before creating that concept of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Indeed, the Dublin system places disproportionate expectations on those Member States constituting entry points into the EU. I therefore agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur on practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity. On this latter issue, I think it is absolutely necessary to make the best use of the complementarities between the different EU funds available, in order to translate solidarity into concrete action, including financial incentives for relocating beneficiaries of international protection.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Comi for her work and for the excellent quality of her report. Standardisation is one of the twelve levers to boost the internal market and will play a key role in helping to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Indeed, the new regulation will enable European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity and safety for their products and services more quickly, using a technically updated, flexible and effective system. This will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, enabling them to reduce production costs and administrative burdens, and raising their profiles in the single European market. That said, we will need to continue encouraging voluntary consultations between industry, public authorities and other stakeholders, so as to ensure that the development of standards and regulations is transparent and can be updated over time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate the Danish Presidency on its excellent work and on the significant results achieved in the context of the European Semester. In particular, I offer my congratulations on its excellent negotiating skills which helped, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, to end the vulgar and absurd diatribe concerning the location of the European patent court. As rapporteur, I agreed, with regret, to postpone the final vote following the Council’s unilateral proposal to amend the proposal for a regulation, but I must point out that this way of operating is unacceptable. It seriously undermines the constitutional balance of the EU, especially in an area and a measure that are fundamental to boosting economic growth in the European Union in key sectors such as innovation. This is a measure in which Parliament took a programmatic, constructive approach. I would therefore like to express my deep bitterness over what happened and call on the Council of Ministers, represented by the Cypriot Presidency that has now taken over, to find a solution with regard to the substance and the procedure as soon as possible. It will not be Parliament that causes a project that we have been working towards for over 30 years to fail, nor shall this Parliament allow the rules governing interinstitutional relations to be unilaterally modified by any institution. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, company law can act as a lever for developing the internal market. In difficult times like these, we now need to work together to find acceptable solutions that can be implemented rapidly. I shall therefore be very clear, Commissioner, as to what this Parliament expects in the coming months; you have already noted certain requirements in your speech. First of all, we hope for a pragmatic and flexible approach to make the legislation clearer and more accessible. To that end, even though a single instrument would offer significant benefits, the directives could alternatively be grouped by sector: for example, by the principles of function, mobility and forms of law. The other priority is to place European company law at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that over 90% of European businesses are SMEs, the internal market needs to be the natural environment for them to operate in, not merely a potential option. Lately, Parliament has been waiting, with some impatience, for a legislative proposal to set out the measures to facilitate companies’ cross-border mobility. That is all I shall say, because this subject is so huge that it is hard to cover it all in just over a minute. Nevertheless, I believe that there will be no shortage of opportunities for useful discussions. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report which, at the end of the European Year of Volunteering, concretely sets out its objectives and strategies. I fully agree with the aim of increasing the importance of volunteering and promoting cross-border regulation at EU level. Cross-border volunteering is an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth, contributing to the development of an economically and ecologically sustainable social conscience. To this end, I consider three initiatives proposed in the report to be key: the establishment of a centralised portal on volunteering, the creation of a European Humanitarian Aid Corps and the development of a European Skills Passport. I hope, finally, that there will continue to be a strong common will to invest in an area of such importance that promotes the development of common values and helps the integration process.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully supported the report by Mr Kalfin, whom I thank for the excellent quality of the work he has done, and agreed with the report’s contents. The Internet is a critical infrastructure. Online attacks can cause serious consequences and safety risks for both businesses and private households. For this reason, I agree on the urgency, highlighted in the report, to develop a reactive, flexible framework to prevent cyber attacks. Since virtuality does not have boundaries, it will be necessary to improve international cooperation and regulations in order to make future strategies effective. In this respect, the European External Action Service (EEAS) can and must play a key role in starting a constructive dialogue with third countries, including, where possible, issues regarding Internet security in the scope of its external relations.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported the report by Ms Herczog, who correctly detects the need for a coherent approach to improve regulatory convergence with neighbouring countries. The fact that Europe is a major purchaser of energy on global markets can, in fact, be seen as a weakness. On the other hand, the fact that we are also the biggest importer could be one of our strengths, if only the EU countries were to take a common negotiating position with third countries. I therefore support the approach proposed by our colleague, in particular, with regard to the three objectives underlying the whole strategy; namely, improvement and coordination at EU level, especially in strategic sectors such as research and innovation, the need for increased diversification of energy sources and, finally, the development of sustainable common policies on a global scale.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Ms Borsellino’s report, which addresses the need for a cross-party, multidisciplinary approach to security. I especially agree with her emphasis on establishing the key areas of the strategy, including the fight against terrorism and organised crime. I do not, however, believe it appropriate to adopt measures to protect intellectual property rights, in that this matter is already the subject of in-depth ongoing debate. That said, it will be essential to enhance EU judicial and police cooperation through Europol and Eurojust, via a proper implementation of the strategy. At the same time, proper and consistent legal instruments will need to be developed to facilitate the investigative process and the use of evidence. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, I welcome Mr de Jong’s report, which seeks to clarify the extension of the new European area of freedom, security and justice in criminal matters. The discussions under way in the Council are proceeding steadily, with two opposing positions: those who warmly welcome developments and those who are cautious about the emergence of an EU criminal law. The operational proposals that Parliament has advanced in response to the Council’s views are on the right track, namely, towards a careful examination of the need for, and the consequences of, adopting EU-wide legislation in this sector. I therefore fully support the request for additional resources to strengthen Parliament’s Legal Service to enable the proposals to be evaluated systematically and in depth. At the same time, in my view, it is essential to promote greater coordination between the institutions on this matter, in order to ensure that future initiatives are based on broad consensus and on Member States’ criminal justice policy requirements.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the priorities and the points Mr Busuttil has stressed in his report. I hope this House will adopt the report by an overwhelming majority so as to further enhance the operation of the single market, which is an absolutely vital part of the policies for EU development. That would send out a strong signal to the individual Member States. The latest results from the internal market scoreboard have shown how Member States are increasingly failing to deliver on the transposition of European legislation. That is why I agree with my fellow Member that we need to increase the power and flexibility of infringement proceedings, while rethinking the role SOLVIT should play as an alternative to seeking legal redress. In that respect, I share his reservations about the danger that we might run into problems with the principle of subsidiarity if the legal basis for SOLVIT is over-formalised. I therefore think the Commission needs to examine all kinds of solutions very carefully so as to make the portal more operational without running the risk of getting bogged down in legal technicalities. Lastly, we must bear in mind the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has redefined Parliament’s role considerably by giving it substantial powers to structure and review EU legislation. In that regard, the conclusions of the scoreboard need to be properly examined within this Parliament’s regular dialogue with the national parliaments, with a view to a more fruitful collaboration with the national authorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Ms Wikström on her work, the excellent quality of the report she has produced, and the compromises she has reached. The purpose of this report is to plug what is, unfortunately, a serious and glaring gap in Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 (Rome II), which emerged due to the lack of an agreement on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. This has arisen, in particular, due to the considerable impact of accessibility via the Internet to content that is published and distributed on a massive scale on blogs and social networks. It is therefore a necessary step to facilitate access to justice, ensure the internal market functions properly and deliver an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the right to privacy. I therefore fully endorse the urgency in adapting Rome II highlighted by the report, and I am particularly pleased with the proposal to create a centre for the voluntary settlement of cross-border disputes arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. Considering the high costs of judicial settlement, an alternative voluntary dispute settlement system, which would, of course, be less costly, could meet two needs. It could protect individual rights and personal image, while at the same time ensuring freedom of opinion. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated Ms Hübner’s report, which offers a useful way to stop essential resources for countries in crisis being decommitted. This is a regulation of fundamental importance which, without making any changes to the European Union’s budget, will provide an alternative to the risk of losing funds already assigned under the cohesion policy to Member States involved in a financial assistance programme that have problems with cofinancing. I especially agree with the precise definition of the instrument’s ceiling and the policy decision to favour projects that have generated revenues and those that could contribute to achieving the Member State’s strategic goals in order to improve its chances of economic recovery. I believe that this measure will contribute to balancing the need for investment in development and growth with the excessively-revered austerity solution to the sovereign debt problem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the agreement addressing the need to strengthen transatlantic cooperation in fighting terrorism after the 11 September attacks. I do not share the intransigent position taken by the rapporteur who, despite the positive opinion of the Commission Legal Service and of the Data Protection Working Party, has continued to assert that the agreement was unnecessary and disproportionate. I am aware of the limits of this agreement and of the room for improvement; nonetheless I believe that its requirements in terms of data protection have greatly improved. The agreement obliges the US authorities to share their data analysis with the judicial authorities of the European Union, explaining in detail its permitted use, namely the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. I therefore believe that it would be unnecessary and detrimental to start new negotiations, at the risk of a rejection of the agreement which might deprive Europe of any law in this field.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this report, through which Parliament is trying to send out an important message on simplifying and harmonising corporate taxation. The existence of 27 different legislations on corporate income tax does not only mean high costs and red tape for businesses operating in different countries, but also the serious risk of tax evasion and tax discrimination. This intervention is essential to reduce the costs for businesses operating in several states and to promote economic growth and economic recovery within the internal market. Finally, the optional nature of this measure, which gives companies the possibility to assess the benefits and costs when choosing the new system, neutralises the reluctance of some Member States that fear their sovereignty in taxation and revenue may be at risk. In the interests of citizens and businesses rather than solely on the basis of calculations of national self-interest, I therefore hope that the Council will be able to reach an agreement without resorting to enhanced cooperation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Berlinguer, whom I congratulate on the work and the excellent analysis he carried out. The report fully highlights the problems and shortcomings that are obstructing the effective development of the European Higher Education Area. In particular, I am referring to the inadequate relationship between universities and the world of work, to the still unfinished revision of the national systems of quality assurance and to unfair access to university educational systems. Therefore, I share my fellow Member’s calls for the adoption of a common system of quality assurance in order to establish mutual recognition of university qualifications. At the same time, I hope that the next ministerial conference, scheduled to take place in April, will address the sore point of the issue: the need and urgency to move quickly in the process of revising the directives on professional qualifications and their recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are almost 450 000 international successions opened each year in the European Union, for a total value, as has already been said, of over EUR 120 billion. Nonetheless, there are still numerous difficulties for citizens to face to establish which State, and which authorities shall have jurisdiction in matters of succession. To that we should add that most Member States do not allow the citizen to choose the jurisdiction applicable at the time of succession. There are also numerous questions arising regarding the judicial recognition of official notarial acts in a Member State other than the one where they were drawn up. These serious shortcomings, these tangible needs on the part of European citizens, are addressed by the regulation which we are about to adopt, and in doing so, ladies and gentlemen, we are not approving a classic piece of legislation, but rather we are creating an instrument to regulate a crucial aspect of institutional organisation within every society: indeed, the concepts of inheritance and succession as well as the rules governing its effects and individual details have huge repercussions for the organisation of any society. For that reason, I would like to sincerely thank everyone who contributed to this challenging project and in particular Mr Lechner for his work and for his efforts during the difficult legislative process that is now coming to its conclusion. I thank him first and foremost on behalf of those millions of European citizens who will benefit from a tool that fully meets their needs and makes a substantial contribution to the process of European integration.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo on the work he has done, which recognises the key role played by the defence of intellectual property rights as an indispensable instrument for economic growth in the European Union, in that it creates jobs and protects cultural diversity. Infringements of intellectual property rights effectively do enormous damage to Union revenues and it is essential to strengthen our efforts to combat unlawful acts through collaboration between national authorities, European Union institutions and industry experts. The adoption of this measure answers this need and enables us to lay the foundation for creating a single market for intellectual property rights. Embedding the Observatory within the European Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will in fact ensure that it has the human, financial and logistical resources it needs in order to carry out its task in an effective manner. We are at the start of a long journey, during which we shall have to monitor and evaluate the Observatory’s activities with close and careful attention. Infringement of intellectual property rights in fact occurs on many levels, requiring different degrees of protection and recognition by Member States. It will be essential to continue to make use of the expertise of national authorities and the many specific representative organisations. This will enable us to strengthen the technical skills of the Observatory, thereby simultaneously ensuring that every intellectual property right is recognised at the EU level without any hierarchical ordering of the level of protection and recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Lechner on the excellent work he has done, which clears the way for a measure that specifically meets the needs of business, particularly of small businesses, and contributes to the process of completing the internal market. The interconnection of national companies registers is of fundamental assistance to firms wishing to open a branch in another Member State or simply do business with enterprises in other states. As well as increasing consumer and user confidence in cross-border transactions, this interconnection will result in saving businesses a potential EUR 69 billion of costs every year. What is more, this measure will increase legal certainty, which will help to solve one of the problems businesses face most often in their cross-border activities. Notwithstanding that the interconnection is of a purely technical nature, and will not therefore also extend to the legal consequences arising from the use of registers, the transparency and the reliability of the information that this will be able to provide and guarantee form the basis on which consumers and information users can exercise and defend their rights. In conclusion, I should point out that a special feature of this measure is that questions of a technical nature cannot be answered exhaustively. In other words, problems and the relevant solutions will arise and have to be developed in the course of the creation of the network. For this reason, the interconnection process will succeed only if, as I hope, the Commission and the Member States work together closely. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of this directive, which implements measures needed to protect the lives and freedoms of the victims of crime. To give an example: according to some estimates, there are about 100 000 women in Europe who benefit from protection orders. Such measures, however, are currently limited in their effect to the territory where they were adopted or in which the victims live. As a result, there is a legislative gap that this directive fills through the mutual recognition of protection orders in the context of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The instrument to be introduced shortly will, in fact, ensure that a protection order issued in one country will automatically be recognised in any Member State that the victim visits. This is an extremely important result, which, in practical terms, helps to create a European Union area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for in the Treaty. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted for Ms Mathieu’s report since I strongly believe that immigration in Europe is a great opportunity, but that it must be managed intelligently and fairly. Without effective intervention, the labour market would be divided and a host of low-cost workers would threaten to undermine the achievements of the European social model. I therefore think this provision will help to prevent and control such a threat by creating a level playing field for the citizens of our countries and for third-country nationals; I am referring, for example, to access to the various kinds of advisory services that the host country makes available. Similarly, I am pleased with the compromises reached on access to education and training and on the portability and transferability of pensions and acquired pension rights, which will no longer depend on whether or not there are bilateral agreements between countries.

 Madam President, I am delighted at the adoption of Mr Lehne’s report, which at last provides for the exemption of micro-enterprises from pointless and often incomprehensible accounting obligations. That will enable each and every one of them to save an average of EUR 1 000 a year and cut their overheads by 25%. It is, in fact, superfluous and disproportionate to subject micro-enterprises that trade only locally or, at most, regionally to the same financial reporting requirements as large companies. Unfortunately, because of a blocking minority comprising a few Member States, the Council wants another two years to approve this measure. I sincerely hope that the Council will stop taking this attitude and we will not always need a crisis to occur for good proposals to be put into effect, when it comes to making life easier for small enterprises, which are a major engine for growth in Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though all EU Member States should respect people’s right to a fair trial, national procedures on information in criminal proceedings vary considerably from one country to another. Some Member States provide for accused persons to receive only oral information about their procedural rights, while others provide information – especially if it is technical – only in writing or at the request of the accused. Since over 8 million criminal proceedings are brought in the European Union every year, it is easy to see that an information system that is still so varied and heterogeneous is inadequate. I therefore agree with the content and aims of this directive. I am referring especially to the general rule making it compulsory to provide accused persons with information about their procedural rights before proceedings begin, particularly the right to be assisted by a lawyer and to be able to benefit from official translations if the proceedings are in a different language. With regard to the stage after proceedings have begun, I agree with the two specific rights selected: the right of accused people to full information about the charges brought against them, and their right to access to the case file. These are two essential conditions for determining and challenging the lawfulness of the arrest or detention and for enabling them to put up the best possible defence. I therefore congratulate the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on their work during the informal trialogues. These have led to the approval of measures that will harmonise the spread and development of fundamental rights, such as the right to a defence and the right to a fair trial.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of promoting a European identity and improving knowledge of our shared history – especially among young people – is of crucial importance, especially at a historical and political juncture like the present. To work towards achieving this goal I voted in favour of the report by Ms Paliadeli, in which I completely agree on the criteria for identifying the sites, which I think should take place transnationally and on a two-yearly basis, thereby boosting the quality of the process. Lastly, I fully agree with the role given to Parliament, which will be duly involved in the process of selecting the chosen sites. For one thing, Parliament has always supported the development of this label, firstly in the 2007 tourism resolution and then in the 2008 resolution on the European agenda for culture in a globalised world.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the complexity of the process of recognition, which affects an extremely high number of professions, is an obstacle to the circulation of European professionals and has negative effects on growth and competition. Therefore, I share Ms McClarkin’s view which aims to streamline administrative processes by creating registration systems and an online portal containing all the relevant information regarding procedures. I believe that the proposal to extend the Internal Market Information system to professions not yet open to the directive on services is valid and necessary. Finally, I hope for further development of the debate towards other and wider categories of professionals. I refer, in particular, to professions close to the world of business, which currently raises an often unnecessary barrier against cross-border exchanges, as in the case of legal and accounting professions. o o o Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Simon’s report since I fully agree with the urgency to bring more clarity and directness to the application of rules on State aid to services of general economic interest. In particular, I believe that there is widespread agreement on the urgency to draw up de minimis
 measures for services of general interest which do not substantially affect commerce between Member States. Having said this, I have some reservations on the approach chosen by the Commission. In fact, I believe that the excessive quantity of texts, between communications, decision and regulation, runs the risk of confusing the normative framework and of making it appear confused and difficult to understand rather than contributing to a genuine and functional updating of existing rules as required.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over 80 million people in Europe are threatened by poverty. The economic crisis has aggravated this situation, leaving the weakest fringes of society exposed. I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Daerden’s report; I particularly appreciated its comprehensiveness and the number of issues raised, making for an effective fight against poverty. I refer specifically to the close examination of cooperation between states, to the definition of common principles to establish the so-called ‘basket’ of goods and services that are essential and accessible to all, and to the fight against child poverty. In the same way, I agree with the lines of action drawn up by the Commission, in particular, the priority of better use of Structural Funds, which could play an essential role in the development of innovative approaches and of specific programmes in the fight against poverty. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, in the field of innovation, European small and medium-sized enterprises are still suffering from slower growth than their counterparts in the United States and in other emerging economies. In this context, unitary patent protection can provide an excellent opportunity to boost the role of SMEs in the area of innovation and research, and contribute to the relaunch of the internal market at the same time. Therefore, I would like to ask whether you intend to propose, in the medium or short term, specific measures to facilitate the access of SMEs to the European patent market – for example, a European fund with the responsibility and power to pay registration fees on behalf of SMEs – and whether you believe that the legislative procedure under way can help and offers a good opportunity to attain this objective.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) in civil, commercial and family matters is a valid alternative to the traditional confrontational approach between parties, offering an effective, inexpensive solution to disputes. I therefore support Ms Wallis’s horizontal approach, which extends the benefits of ADR to business-to-business civil and commercial transactions and to family disputes. That said, I hope that the Commission’s forthcoming legislative proposal will satisfy the key points highlighted by this Parliament: above all, the need to ensure a high level of impartiality and transparency of the systems, the application of ADR to electronic commerce by means of an online multilingual platform, and the promotion of ADR as a valid, cost-effective alternative to forms of collective redress.

 Mr President, public procurement can play a decisive role for the EU budget: indeed, public expenditure on works, goods and services accounts for roughly 17% of EU GDP and almost a fifth of this expenditure – approximately EUR 420 billion – falls within the scope of the EU directives on public procurement. I would therefore congratulate Ms Rühle for setting out what I believe to be the red lines of the forthcoming reform of the directive on public procurement: in particular, I am referring to the criterion of lowest price, which can no longer be the determining one for the award of contracts and should be replaced by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender in terms of economic, social and environmental benefits. Similarly, I agree entirely with the urgent need to simplify the rules in order to make procurement procedures simpler, less cumbersome and more in line with the needs of SMEs and small contracting authorities. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis has shown that the Stability and Growth Pact is not working as it should. Six Member States, three of which are in the euro area, are having budgetary problems and risk defaulting on their debt. This is a situation that we must urgently put an end to. It is important, however, that this be done in a way that is sustainable and with a view to the future. That is why I voted in favour of the Goulard report, whose approach of using sanctions I approve of, particularly with respect to manipulation of financial data, falsified statistics or misleading information on the part of a Member State. At the same time, however, future efforts must be directed at what is the heart of the problem, namely the insufficient degree of economic integration within the European Union. Sanctions will have a merely cursory dissuasive effect if we do not reinforce the bonds forged by single economic policies by increasing the number of surveillance missions by the Commission, and in the medium term, the use of Eurobonds. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having regular access to up-to-date and reliable budgetary data is the key to regulating public spending and enabling the swift adoption of corrective measures in times of crisis. I therefore agree on the need to allow the Commission to monitor, with the help of a fiscal body, individual Member States’ compliance with budgetary rules. Having said that, I must point out that, under the Treaty, the establishment of a medium-term financial framework leaves the way clear for newly elected governments to amend the programming decisions that were previously taken. This directive must therefore be applied to the letter, and the Commission must constantly monitor its application. This is to ensure that intervention has a tangible rather than superficial effect and that it helps to achieve the directive’s primary objective: uniform compliance with budgetary discipline as stipulated by the Treaty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Thursday evening, the Bundestag
 will vote on the agreement of 21 July, while in the very near future, we expect to receive the Troika’s report on the situation in Greece. Essentially, Mr Juncker, a number of economists are accusing us, together with European leaders and European institutions, of wasting precious time in saving the euro. We have reached a crossroads for Europe and for our currency. In this light, what can we expect from the meeting of the Eurogroup Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 3 October? Do you believe that a solution is possible? If so, which solution and with what kind of political support? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union continues to move forward at too slow a pace in the area of science, and is not catching up with the United States and Japan, who are the leaders in this field. On average the 27 Member States invest 2% of GDP in research and development, rather than respecting the 3% target set by the Commission. As a result the publication of the Green Paper by the European Commission seems even more opportune, as it enables us to actively revive the discussion, as described by the excellent report by Ms Matias. I second the request made by the rapporteur concerning the establishment of an all-European common fund to promote collaborative research in the European Union and reduce inequality among Member States. At the same time I believe it is essential that any measure is preceded by a doubling of the research and innovation programme budget for the financing period from 2014. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the successful implementation of Directive 2008/52/EC shows that mediation is a viable alternative to the traditional adversarial approach, in that it allows for the amicable settlement of disputes and thus reduces the workload of the courts. This is confirmed by the various initiatives taken by some Member States, which are encouraging, where possible, the use of mediation through financial incentives or legislative provisions. In view of that, I should like to draw attention to certain aspects that I believe deserve further thought and consideration, starting with the issue of costs: we should follow the example of Member States that have tackled this problem by providing financial incentives to use mediation. I also believe that we need to explore other possibilities, such as the use of awareness campaigns to promote the use and understanding of alternative forms of dispute resolution, especially on the part of businesses. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary also, and above all, to involve members of the legal system, who must see the added value of mediation as something that enhances, rather than competes with, their work. Lastly, looking ahead to the forthcoming Commission communication on the implementation of the directive and, in particular, to the imminent legislative proposal on alternative dispute resolution, I should like to emphasise the way in which mediation complements other reforms of EU law, in particular, the approach to forms of collective redress and to contract law. Indeed, as a preliminary measure, mediation can be an excellent alternative to forms of collective redress and can make an important contribution to the future instrument on contract law, significantly reducing the use of dispute resolution mechanisms.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work, which offers some interesting points of departure for increasing the quality and effectiveness of European legislative activity. I shall restrict myself to highlighting a number of aspects which I think are especially significant: it is absolutely essential to achieve a 25% cut in red tape, which can only be achieved through greater collaboration between the Commission and the Member States on measures designed to avoid diverging interpretations and the resulting ‘gold-plating’ of transposed legislation. With the same objective in mind, we need to ensure high quality correlation tables between directives and national transposition measures and we need to carry out retrospective assessments of the legislation implemented on a more frequent basis. These are essential measures for ensuring that EU legislation achieves its primary goal, which is meeting the expectations of EU citizens, the businesses operating on the single market, and national and local governments. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, a little less than a year ago, Parliament adopted the new directive to combat late payments. This was a vital recast which, by imposing firm deadlines on payments made by public administrations, satisfies the requests made by businesses and citizens and amounts to a formidable counter-cyclical measure that will also combat unemployment, which is laying waste to our countries. I would point out in this regard that one in four businesses fail due to late payments by public administrations, with the resulting loss of many jobs. Member States must transpose this new legislation not later than 16 March 2013. I would therefore like to ask Mr Tajani what measures the Commission is taking to ensure proper transposition of the directive into the various national legal systems and to facilitate the early entry into force of the directive, as promised by a number of Member States? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her work and the contents of her report, with which I am in complete agreement. I believe that only an optional instrument to be adopted by means of a regulation can adequately fulfil the objectives of the whole reform of European contract law. Moreover, an optional instrument should neither harmonise nor replace national contract laws but rather work alongside them as an alternative instrument that offers freedom of choice to contracting parties. Therefore, I do not agree with the proposals put forward by those who would prefer to limit the scope of this instrument so that it applies only to e-commerce contracts, as this would create an artificial and, above all, unnecessary distinction between online and face to face transactions. Our task as legislators is not to limit the legal nature of the regulation on the basis of speculation or market projections but rather to ensure legal certainty and to lay the foundations for a common legal language in the field of commerce. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 One necessary component of effective enforcement of judgments is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor’s assets and to freeze them. Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market. That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system, by which I mean an additional, autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts. This preventive measure will also provide a further deterrent against payment delays and will force the disclosure of assets in cross-border claims. Raffaele Baldassare,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Single Market Act lies in its desire to satisfy the needs of the market, facilitating access and participation of all those involved: businesses, consumers and workers. Given this ambitious goal, I am satisfied with the interventions proposed by Mr Barnier and the indications provided by this Parliament. In my opinion, some priorities are imperative for achieving the objectives that the EU has proposed, in particular: improving the access of small and medium-sized enterprises in the domestic market, reducing their administrative obligations and facilitating their participation in contract bidding procedures, removing all obstacles to the development of electronic commerce, and supporting and financing innovation, particularly through the issuance of bonds for European Union projects, especially in energy, transport and telecommunications. Finally, only by connecting development and support for the business world with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy regarding employment can we achieve what I believe to be the aim of this act, namely, to create a social market economy based on growth, competitiveness and sustainability.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your speech and the list of measures announced, and will not enter into the legal and regulatory debate on temporary protection of migrants and the application of Article 80 of the Treaty. As we speak, unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast, their passengers often paying with their lives. Despite the recent transfers, Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria. Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people, while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations. Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow, but we cannot continue to go it alone. We need the European Union, we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration, starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Schwab on the work he has done so far and the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Providing for varying degrees of harmonisation of standards will allow us to achieve important results, which will provide real added value for European citizens. Significant among these are the fourteen-day right of withdrawal and the new rules on information requirements, not only on price but also on the identity and address of the seller. These improvements will increase consumer confidence, especially in cross-border shopping by providing the legal certainties essential for the development of e
-commerce. This directive will also lay the foundation for other complementary measures, from the reform of European contract law to the process of reviewing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This fundamental harmonisation action is an essential condition for the development of an internal market focused on the rights of its consumers and serving the citizens of the European Union. About a year ago, Professor Monti said in his report to President Barroso: ‘Consumers and consumer welfare should be at the centre of the next stage of the single market’. First, the law-maker should reach early agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, to ensure a high level of protection in an integrated retail market. This provision fully meets the demands, and I am convinced that Mr Schwab will maintain the necessary determination in the complex negotiations that will follow before the final adoption of the text.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report and I should like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Járóka for the work she has done. She managed to bring together the different positions and establish clear objectives and priorities for the strategy; namely, the provision of specific measures against nomadic lifestyles, guarantees on basic healthcare, equal access to primary, secondary and higher education, and the right to housing. The strategy actually aims at inclusion and not merely integration. It is obvious that the role of the Commission and local authorities will be crucial, above all, in terms of controlling and managing European Union funds. The only limitation of this report is the lack of instruments to check the actual desire for integration amongst some Roma communities and the consequences that are likely to stem from any unwillingness to remain on the territory of a Member State or participate in the treatments, and the aid and welfare programmes, which certainly cannot continue ad infinitum
 without producing results. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although some excellent results have been achieved so far on the road towards European integration, there remain some gaps in fundamental areas for the development of a democratic system and full confirmation of the rule of law. Despite the progress made with the amendments to the legislation on criminal procedures and other primary laws, some aspects are still substantially behind schedule. I refer, in particular, to the urgent need to ensure the responsibility and efficiency of the judiciary, as well as its transparency, not to mention that of the public prosecutor’s office, and their independence from political interference. To that end, substantial changes are needed to the system for appointing judges and public prosecutors, putting an end to the practice whereby their appointments only take place in parliament and within the government. Lastly, (...) to improve access to justice and to free legal assistance. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 The market in services represents two thirds of the gross domestic product and two thirds of jobs in the European Union, but even so, only a fifth of total intra-EU trade. All the same, I can only agree with the priorities enumerated by the rapporteur and, in particular, as regards the completion of the points of single contact and the strengthening of administrative cooperation. As things stand, the first generation of points of single contact exists in 22 Member States. This would appear to afford us some comfort, were it not for the fact that in only 14 of them is it possible to complete the process online. On the contrary, it is essential that points of single contact become an integral part of greater e-government in the EU, making the offering available in different languages. Finally, it is essential to strengthen administrative cooperation so that the whole of this communication-based system can function efficiently. The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has already become a vitally important tool. It supports the work done by administrations, enables different administrative methods to be coordinated and deficient information to be supplemented. In spite of this, monitoring will, in future, be necessary to make sure that this system is not only used but also, and above all, correctly applied. Raffaele Baldassarre,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with exceptional speed and dynamism, this Parliament is about to consent to the first instance of enhanced cooperation that specifically concerns the internal market. The accepted justification for this is that the discussion on a European patent has been on the agenda for many years. We should therefore do well to specify that the draft regulation on the translation regime was not adopted by the Commission until 30 June 2010 and that the Council took note of the lack of unanimity and the difficulty of reaching a unanimous decision in the near future in November 2010. I shall gloss over, then, the pace at which we in Parliament have dealt with the dossier, which I hope will serve as an example for the future, because we have broken records of some significance in favour of a speedy and efficient legislative passage. Nevertheless, since it is not my intention to act solely as a spokesman for the interests of my country, which is currently opposed to enhanced cooperation, and since I believe that the subject of the patent is fundamental to the development of industry and the European entrepreneurial system, I should like merely to raise certain questions that I consider to be important for the exercise by this House of its legislative functions and for the future treatment of regulations on the patent. First and foremost, we should do well to recognise that a vote in favour of enhanced cooperation will systematically legitimise the application to the development of the internal market of an instrument that should instead have the quality of a last resort. We are therefore creating a precedent that could be used in all areas of the internal market. Furthermore, I believe that this Parliament can, when we are faced with other subjects, subsequently state its view in a manner that is exhaustive and autonomous, and that individual proposals are at the centre of users’ and businesses’ interests rather than those of individual groups of countries.

 Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am pleased to have had a Presidency that has proved able to manage the European agenda in a pragmatic and effective way, albeit at a difficult time. From the adoption at first reading of the recast of the directive on combating late payment in public administration, which is fundamental to the future of the system of undertakings, to the adoption of the financial supervision package, the Belgian Presidency has proved to be both practical and dynamic. I could cite other examples, but I prefer to draw conclusions about what can be learnt from a Presidency that has concluded its term of office in a positive way. Firstly, one has to have a realistic work programme; secondly, one has to be able to negotiate dynamically and reach compromises; and, lastly, one has to fully involve the European institutions, starting with Parliament, and take an approach to outstanding issues that is free from constraints and national interests. I hope that this Presidency will serve as an example to the others that follow it. For now though, I offer it my most sincere congratulations. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend for my speech to deny the seriousness of a situation that is the inevitable outcome of obvious administrative and political failings, which have been – and still are – in danger of burying an entire city and its surroundings in waste. Mr Søndergaard and Mrs Lichtenberger, the crisis in Campania initially began and then developed so dramatically because of the inability of a regional council and a left-wing Naples city council, together with aldermen from the Greens, to take decisions – including unpopular and brave decisions – to create an environmentally friendly waste collection and disposal system. Irresponsibility, indecision, political gain, sinister collusion and waste characterised a political and administrative phase that is now definitively over. I want to reassure those who tabled the oral questions and the political groups that supported them that the political situation is viable and has completely changed. The national government and the new regional council have shouldered their responsibilities and have the political determination to resolve the crisis. Through a dialogue with the populations concerned and with the necessary resolve, they are overcoming obstacles and objections that are often caused by Nimby Syndrome, or the idea that people do not want others’ rubbish in their backyard. As a result, they have drawn up an integrated waste collection and disposal plan that will shortly provide incentives for separate collection and the construction of the necessary facilities. It would therefore be extremely unfair, counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting: imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union, which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs. This contradiction reveals some people’s genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested. The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union. The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption. On the one hand, this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature. However, on the other hand, the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes. The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and, naturally, the political approach is changing. The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union. This is the basis of today’s debate and the oral question submitted, which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament, and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown. Allow me to recall Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who said: ‘All grown-ups were children once – although few of them remember it’. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating a European identity and increasing citizens’ interest in the European Union and its origins are two challenges that the European institutions must face up to in order to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity. Furthermore, these challenges are at the heart of the goals of the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, Article 3 of the Treaty establishes the EU’s obligation to safeguard European cultural development. If the European dream is going through a difficult phase at the moment, this is not only down to the impasse
 regarding Europe as a political project, or the ongoing economic crisis, but is also due to the difficulties faced by a Union founded on an as yet unresolved identity. In this situation, it is more necessary than ever to reduce the gap between the European Union and its citizens, bringing the multinational yet shared cultural heritage of the European Union to its citizens and, above all, to future generations. This is the meaning and importance of a European Heritage Label: to bring Europe together in its diversity, promoting a shared culture and favouring integration between the places involved within its territory. In order to realise this objective, the new label will focus on the symbolic educational value rather than on the aesthetic beauty of a site, favouring cooperation between sites and supporting joint projects amongst them. I should therefore like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mrs Paliadeli and the rest of the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular, with regard to the procedure for selecting the sites and strengthening the role of the European Parliament during the selection process. I am sure that the Member States’ decision to insert the label within the framework of the European Union will contribute to increasing its visibility and prestige, so as to realise the objectives of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on Mr Szájer’s report tomorrow, we will give the go-ahead for one of the new instruments – on implementing acts – contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. This will simplify the old comitology system. It is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts, regulating methods of control by Member States over the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission. The fundamental importance of the Regulation has made the legislative procedure complicated both at inter-institutional level and within Parliament where, however, because of the involvement – albeit belated – of all committees, I hope it will be possible to adopt the proposal at first reading. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for succeeding in achieving the priority objectives for the European Parliament: I refer to the guarantees to align the current comitology procedures with the new procedure, the right to scrutiny by Parliament and the Council, the creation of an appeal committee chaired by the Commission and the inclusion of a review clause that will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the procedure. Allow me a final comment on what was the last obstacle to the negotiations: the inclusion of the common commercial policy within the scope of the future Regulation. Although the final agreement will allow the application of a simple majority voting system for the adoption of anti-dumping measures during a transitional period of 18 months, subsequently the measures will be adopted by qualified majority. This solution was the outcome of a difficult compromise but I am convinced that it satisfies both the needs of industry and the European Union executive, removing decisions of a technical nature from the risk of dangerous politicisation.

 Mr President, after the adoption of the Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service, we are today called on to make that decision operational by amending the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations of Union officials. In that respect, I would like to focus on an aspect of the report that has involved us in difficult negotiations: the issue of geographical balance in the composition of the European diplomatic corps. Some Members would, in fact, have preferred different criteria for the selection of staff, based on country of origin and citizenship. Such proposals have been avoided by means of balanced compromise amendments, which have been able to take geographical and gender balance into account without imposing country-based selection criteria. The selection of country-based quotas would not, in fact, have been a suitable or desirable solution. After over 50 years of European integration, the Union’s first real diplomatic corps is now being created. It has to be put in a position to be able to develop a common foreign policy and serve the Union’s interests on the international stage. For it to accomplish this task, it is crucial that its staff represent the Union and not the Member States of which they are citizens or have been diplomatic officers. That is the line that the Committee on Legal Affairs took yesterday when adopting the Rapkay report, and that is the line that I hope will continue to be taken in the vote in plenary. Raffaele Baldassarre,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, Mrs Weiler, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased and proud to have contributed to the adoption of this directive on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is a vital counter-cyclical measure which provides very real support to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by laying down definite payment terms and appropriate penalties to encourage punctual payment by both public authorities and private enterprise in the European Union. If everyone involved paid their debts on time, the European economy would receive a cash injection worth EUR 300 billion. Our market will not be common and our competition will not be fair until uniform rules are established that apply to everybody. That is the motivation behind the new directive on combating late payment: it forces public authorities to be more efficient and virtuous in their actions and helps the internal market and free competition to develop homogeneously, to the benefit of SMEs. This House has been able to make a decisive contribution to this successful outcome by overcoming all kinds of pressure and divisions for the sake of the general good of the people and of the European production system.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg’s report highlights a fundamental question for the EU integration process: the need to make simple, clear laws that EU citizens can understand. I cannot fail to agree with the key objectives identified by the rapporteur, in particular respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the importance accorded to the impact assessments and to reducing administrative burdens. With regard to the impact assessments, I am keen to stress that the Committee on Legal Affairs is actively working so that the European Commission can develop mechanisms to provide guarantees and ensure the independence of the analyses carried out. This is a fundamental question: ensuring higher standards for the impartiality of the assessments would give the EU’s legislative proposals greater credibility, and would simplify the process for their adoption. Furthermore, I consider it vital to work towards a clear reduction of the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation. The European Commission would like to reduce these burdens by 25% by 2012, which would entail an increase in the level of EU GDP of 1.4%, equivalent to EUR 150 billion. A substantial part of EU administrative burdens stems, in fact, from the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of administrative procedures implemented at national level. To give an example: 72 EU legislative acts have imposed 486 information obligations, which have led to the adoption in the Member States of more than 10 000 implementing acts. While on the one hand, increased monitoring is required during the transposition of Union law, on the other, greater collaboration by the Council and the individual Member States is essential. To conclude, I think that, leaving aside matters concerning the principle of subsidiarity, closer cooperation with national parliaments can provide a decisive contribution towards making EU laws more effective and ultimately bringing them closer in line with the needs of EU citizens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new guidelines to promote employment constitute a fundamental step towards economic recovery and growth in Europe. The meltdown has triggered a significant rise in the unemployment rate. In 2010, this figure reached 9.6%, and 20.3% for youth unemployment; in other words, millions and millions of people are unemployed. Yet unemployment is only part of the problem. Indeed, the task is not simply to create new jobs but to improve and preserve the ones that already exist. To achieve the goals set out in the report, we also need a structural change in the economy. In this respect, despite the considerable efforts expended by the rapporteur, Mr Őry, Parliament’s response to the statistics I have just mentioned remains general and unfocused, and this is to the detriment of the European strategy. Indicators and key targets are not enough. It is not enough to use terms such as ‘coordinate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘collaborate’. A pact between generations is not enough. We need a European policy that meets the needs of its citizens. The limits imposed by budget policies must be overturned by more specific, development-oriented public planning. We must direct the actions we take today towards helping young people and future generations; we need training and education policies that allow for investment in human capital in order to improve its quality and to connect it to the labour market. We need to make choices that will help the production system. To sum up: we need less paperwork, more investment and clearer economic choices. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Interconnecting business registers is an essential prerequisite for promoting integration of the economic area within the EU and for improving legal certainty for businesses and consumers. Mr Lechner’s report picks out very clearly what are the priority measures that are indispensable for making the law more certain and for making cross-border economic transactions more transparent. Firstly, it is vital that interconnecting registers and access to data take place in a single framework. To this end, it will be necessary to strengthen and develop the potential offered by the BRITE interconnection project in order that a single portal can be established through which all our citizens can obtain information on European businesses. Secondly, it will be vital that it is adopted with a view to making integration of business registers compulsory for all Member States, so that all states take part as soon as possible. This is because the success of any project that aims to achieve a harmonious development of the internal market requires the participation of all interested parties so that it can be made compulsory as soon as the technical standards have been fully developed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Albania is a fundamental factor in the stability of the Western Balkans and in the EU enlargement process. The country is taking important steps to develop democracy, improve infrastructures and transition to an open and competitive economy. However, Albania’s path to the European Union is still blocked by the difficult stabilisation of the party system, due, in part, to the obstructive behaviour of the opposition, which has a negative impact on the development and approval of structural reforms. The economy is still being held back by an uncertain legal framework, widespread illegality, a large informal economy and inadequate energy and transport systems. Italy has played, and still plays, an important role in the stabilisation of Albania: Italy is its main trade partner, main investor and main benefactor – 430 000 Albanians live in Italy. However, these forms of collaboration need to be supported by European action, with cooperation on a macro-regional basis, such as Adriatic-Ionian cooperation, to help pave the way for Europe in the Mediterranean.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has confronted us with the evidence that greater coordination at European level is an absolute priority for the development and stability of the financial markets. That said, I shall limit myself here to highlighting one fundamental issue, particularly in the light of the difficult trialogues still ongoing. If giving financial oversight authorities the power to adopt individual, directly binding decisions – as provided for in Article 10 of the regulations – responds to the political desire to react quickly to emergency situations, then in the case of daily supervision, this power conflicts with Articles 17 and 258 of the treaty, which state that it is the exclusive power of the Commission to ensure the application of the law of the Union. Furthermore, in this case, a paradoxical situation would be created in which the Member States, present in the highest body through their own authorities, would be indirectly responsible for applying the law of the Union. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I proposed a compromise amendment which attempts to resolve this discrepancy between the powers conferred on the authorities and the role and competences of the Commission, in full compliance with the treaty. I hope that the contribution of the Legal Affairs Committee can be used as a basis for any further compromises with the other European institutions in order to arrive swiftly at a much needed solution, which is completely in accordance with the law of the Union.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers in the scope of the directive. This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules. By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules. Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition. Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost. It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks. In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers’ health and safety.

 The proposal for a draft Framework Decision establishes fundamental obligations based on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court case law. The right to interpretation and translation is essential for those who must defend themselves in a criminal trial and cannot speak the language of the proceeding. Moreover, under Article 6 of the Treaty, the Union respects the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which upholds the right to a fair trial. The text we are discussing today is a satisfactory and fully acceptable compromise. In the compromise solutions, the Presidency in fact safeguarded the essential points indicated by Member States with regard to costs arising from implementation of the directive and the transposition period. In the light of all this, I am pleased by the results achieved within the Council and European Parliament: interpretation must be offered in the mother tongue of the suspect or in a language known to the suspect, while translation will be offered only for the essential documents and the possibility of drawing up oral summaries of the main documents will be considered.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the creation of the Union and the holding of the summit of Heads of State or Government, we still lack a clear definition of EU Mediterranean policy and a long-term strategic vision for the development and stabilisation of the region. Yet the Mediterranean has enormous potential: one third of global maritime traffic now passes through Mediterranean waters, coming from China, Asia, European countries, India, reaching our waters via the Suez Canal. The coastal countries of the Middle East and of Africa are advanced developing countries and for us, they are vital in certain fundamental areas, including that of migration flows. We must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean, providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects. The key points include agriculture, transport, maritime highways, transnational corridors, renewable energy and the Solar Plan. In the words of Paul Morand, a French diplomat and writer, the Mediterranean is, above all, the anti-desert civilisation. Let us reassert these words. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last two years have left millions of unemployed people in their wake, have been the cause of further national debt that will remain for many years still, and have put renewed pressure on and new tears in our social cohesion. We must react in a timely and incisive manner, and, in order to avoid making the errors of judgment that the Lisbon Strategy succumbed to, Europe 2020 must be extremely realistic in its objectives and balanced in the goals it sets itself. Three of these seem to me, Commissioner, to be priorities. The first is certainly a stable currency and stable national budgets, which, however, must not be divorced from development and economic growth. We need investment in research and innovation to make our industries ever more competitive and our products of the highest quality. We must support SMEs and new industries, such as IT and sustainable energy and, of course, our infrastructure. Let us raise the overall level of education, yes, but chiefly we must mould training to the needs of the labour market and production. It is a paradox that businesses are still demanding specialisms that the market is in no position to offer. It is clear that every target should be related to the national context, but within the framework of a broader European strategy. I shall conclude by saying that the Greek crisis and the economic and employment crisis in the whole of Europe testify to the fact that in order to safeguard social cohesion, development and stable national budgets, we need strong and solid economic governance at the European level, to enable European institutions, including Parliament, to take effective and preventive action.

– Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Szájer for the outstanding work delivered in so little time. The delegated acts will be of paramount importance for Union law and the interinstitutional balance in the EU. Therefore, it is fundamental that they are developed and decided upon in a fully transparent manner which effectively enables the Parliament and the Council to democratically control the exercise of the power delegated to the Commission. To this extent, as advocated by the Szájer report, some issues will be of utmost importance and require our stronger commitment. These include, inter alia, the possibility for the European Parliament to revoke the delegation at any time and to make sure that Parliament and Council are conferred the same rights concerning their involvement in the process of delegation. Finally, I would like to stress that it should be a priority for the Commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis
 to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291, including the acquis
 in policy areas which, pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty, are now subject to the codecision procedure. Raffaele Baldassarre,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, needle-stick and other sharp injuries are among the most common risks faced by healthcare workers in Europe, and they therefore represent a serious problem both for the healthcare sector and for society in general. The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers’ Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions. The main aim of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or pointed objects used in medicine. This agreement therefore represents an important step towards an increase in safety within the hospital sector. As we all agree, the consequences of sharp injuries can be extremely serious and can cause the spread of diseases such as viral hepatitis and AIDS. That being said, I must stress the need for an integrated and, at the same time, realistic approach to this problem. In this respect I believe that the administrative, financial and legal constraints deriving from the agreement should not be excessive and therefore should not be such as to harm the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the healthcare sector, or else these enterprises could have serious difficulties in complying with the terms of the agreement. Just as commendable, moreover, is the anticipated – to ‘anticipated’ I would add ‘desirable’ – option for the Member States to adopt more effective provisions and measures than those contained in the agreement with the aim of protecting workers. Lastly, I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament, which often focuses on this issue, so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the microfinance facility for employment is part of a set of initiatives that have been adopted at European level, and it gives the unemployed an opportunity for a new start and opens the door to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including, of course, the young. The new facility should extend the range of targeted financial support to new entrepreneurs in the current context of a reduced credit supply. Individual entrepreneurs and founders of micro-enterprises will also be assisted by way of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building, in addition to interest-rate support from the European Social Fund. It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis. Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment. It is, however, necessary that the transfer of Progress funds remains unchanged, in the sense that we cannot give the signal to divert resources from the Progress programme. These resources need to be found from other sources and, above all, need to be associated with other European initiatives, so that we project a strong image and make a strong effort in favour of the unemployed in Europe.

The Treaty of Lisbon substantially changes the institutional balances that were originally outlined by the Treaty of Maastricht concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by including, though with substantial exceptions, the ordinary legislative procedure relating to the area of freedom, security and justice. It is therefore necessary for any amendment to the measures implementing the Europol decision to be adopted within the new legislative framework envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Europol cannot be strengthened unless Parliament is able to express itself properly on regulations relating to measures that are not purely technical but political, such as the transfer of personal data. Allow me to add a thought concerning the European Union’s increasingly outward-looking stance and the increased synergy between internal security and defence. Even if the treaty has no immediate effect on the development of security and defence markets, it paves the way for the development of a more integrated and consistent security market, which requires legislative actions that are coordinated and therefore interinstitutional. It would therefore be all the more inconsistent, if not indeed harmful, to adopt ‘political’ amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision that do not follow the legislative procedure envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both proposals fully transfer to the Commission the powers which, until now, have been held by the Council. With the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the consequent abolition of the pillar-based Community structure, the legal situation will be profoundly different and significantly modified. Therefore, the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent allocation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars. This is why I feel it is essential that the proposal provides for greater involvement of the Member States – I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that the involvement of experts is sufficient – and, above all, true involvement, true participation of the European Parliament within the coordinating group of the mechanism to monitor and verify the proper application of the Schengen acquis
. Furthermore, in my opinion, we should determine and better define, by means of more comprehensive, more precise criteria, how to use the migratory pressure parameter, which pinpoints the areas of greatest risk where unannounced visits should take place. Lastly, the proposals should be treated as a single package and not separately, since they both represent common aspects of the same issue and have the same shortcomings. This is also because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the applicable procedure will be codecision. I therefore fully support the position set out by Mr Coelho and the calls on the Commission to withdraw these proposals and submit other, better ones, which take into account what has come out of this debate.

‘Finning’, or the removal the fins of sharks on board vessels, with the remaining parts of the animal’s body being thrown into the sea, has been banned in the EU since 2003. In order to put an end to this practice, it should be made mandatory for sharks to be landed with their fins still naturally attached to their body. Many fishing boats in the Mediterranean Sea practice finning since the sought-after shortfin mako and blue shark are both common, although these species might soon be listed as threatened with extinction. Illegal fishing is on the rise in the Mediterranean, in part due to the high demand for shark fins and the prices that they command. This type of non-sustainable fishing causes serious damage to the marine ecosystem, especially in recent years in the Mediterranean, where there is evidence that a number of shark populations have been affected by the practice. Greater cooperation is required in order to combat this illegal practice on board fishing vessels. To this end, the Member States must step up controls both at sea and in port, preventing the bodies of sharks from being thrown into the sea. Finning must be made transparent, controlled and above all regulated, so that it can be considered a sustainable and non-invasive form of fishing. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Enlargement represents the future of the European Union in order to ensure cohesion and integration. The recent financial crisis has highlighted the interdependence of national economies, both within and beyond the EU. It is therefore important to consolidate relations, especially in the economic area, with candidate and potential candidate countries. It is essential to create a climate of harmony and conciliation between different nations and peoples, encouraging economic cultural and religious dialogue. The peaceful resolution of conflicts and the establishment of good neighbourly relations between European countries are essential to sustainable peace and stability and contribute substantially to a genuine European integration process. It is important to give adequate priority within enlargement policy to the building of an efficient, independent and impartial judicial system, effectively fighting corruption, money laundering and organised crime. Enlargement must remain a credible policy, based on democracy, human rights and reconciliation. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the ‘better law-making’ initiative we discussed back in September served as a basis for this second sympathetic report from the rapporteur. The Treaty of Lisbon has undoubtedly given Parliament additional powers at an important time for European integration. Nevertheless, law-making, in concrete terms, remains out of kilter with citizens’ expectations. All this clearly requires careful monitoring and increased cooperation, based on the confidence demonstrated by European institutions in individual Member States to guarantee the uniform and homogeneous application of EU law in all 27 Member States. Law-making must be clearly informed by clarity, transparency and coherence, with respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, but at the same time it needs to challenge the fact that some Member States are somewhat unwilling to support this integration process, which is particularly significant from a legislative perspective. We therefore need workable tools that facilitate the transposition process and allow further judicial cooperation, on the assumption that the infringement procedure is the symptom of a pathology that must be cured by force.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that better legislation is an ongoing goal both of Parliament and of the institutional bodies that contribute, through colegislative powers, to giving a sufficiently clear and orderly framework for the more than 500 million EU citizens that expect clear, accessible and consistent laws. Indeed, consistency is not just a political issue but must translate in real life into legislation that meets this fundamental requirement. It is important to highlight that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, this requirement is best met by close cooperation with national parliaments. We need appropriate criteria for assessing the correct application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and, above all, we need the will to work out whether eight weeks are enough time for Member States to give the opinion it is their right to express. Institutional websites providing information for citizens are helpful, but we also need greater engagement from local bodies and regional levels of government. Lastly, evidence-based policy making may be combined with impact assessments on the legislative process to measure its effectiveness. All of this contributes to building a properly simplified framework to avoid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing more costs than they do already and ensures that the gap between Brussels and Strasbourg, and between Member States and citizens, is reduced. A Europe of citizens with the EU institutions genuinely at their service is what Parliament must aim to make into a reality. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, the four reports that have been adopted today clearly demonstrate Parliament’s desire to make a decisive contribution to supporting the fisheries sector, which is currently beset by major difficulties. I voted in favour because I feel there is a vital need for coordinated action, just as I also believe that an approach involving regionalisation is absolutely essential in order to tailor this action to the needs of individual areas. We need to trim down the industry, expand market opportunities, enable fleets to modernise and ensure that there is real modernisation and growth in the sector, in which environmental sustainability must go hand in hand with economic profitability. We await the framework regulation and finally the implementing dossier on the funding for the further acceleration that we think is needed. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this dossier because I believe that the issue of energy efficiency, together with sustainability and competitiveness, can certainly be an essential instrument in a particularly difficult process, such as this one. We need sustainable growth that has to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and that can be used as a virtuous cycle, including through innovative green technology. All this must be achieved through a culture of design that makes the best use of these resources, channelling them towards building refurbishment, which, in particular, requires the full and appropriate use of EU cohesion funds. One third of buildings in Europe were built after 1973, which is clearly significant. It is possible to act within this context, including by means of better training and design that is consistent with the aims of the provision. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report because I consider financing infrastructure projects in the field of transport and energy to be of crucial importance in achieving the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as laid down by Europe 2020. As highlighted many times by the Commission and by Parliament, developing the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), trans-European energy network (TEN-E) and telecommunication infrastructures is part of the overall and necessary framework to relaunch EU employment and investment. Therefore, adequate support for financial resources guarantees the project will go ahead, and so acts as a catalyst for private investors, for whom uncertain risk perceptions and the ceaseless advance of the global economic crisis block the flow of finance. The construction of new modern and integrated infrastructures is fundamental if Europe is to remain a competitive, central player on the world stage and a leader in the post-crisis international economy. Building new infrastructures will create an enabling environment for a striving and competitive European private sector, stimulating growth, creating jobs for young people and engaging future generations in the relaunch of our economy, thus addressing some of the most pressing challenges our continent is facing today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for and have supported this measure, because I think it is in line with the overall strategy to develop a sector that is still really struggling and is affected by huge market volatility, environmental challenges and the need to ensure environmental safety. I would say that the limit on aid to individual farmers is right, that the incentives for greening to help these new processes develop and inject competitiveness into the sector are good, and that so is the support for young people. This is an important, meaningful programme that also affects small entrepreneurs. What we really need is development. Simplified, leaner procedures that ensure direct payment are vital, to ensure that a sector that finds itself in great difficulty has a chance for real development. That is why I voted in favour and why I have supported an intervention that also allows for direct payments to young farmers to give them a chance and an opportunity to take the initiative and develop their business, which could bring significant results in terms of employment that the European Union cannot ignore.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure also falls within a wider context of a joint strategic framework on agriculture. It is an important intervention that ties in with the others also adopted in today’s sitting. We have, however, observed – including in light of the information provided by Mr De Castro – that the Council’s stance on opposing delegated acts constitutes an unwarranted removal of Parliament’s competences and powers. Inter-institutional dialogue would, instead, force the Council to take a more flexible stance. Simplification on EU funds and the possible use of the Structural Funds are important issues, as are the preservation of ecosystems, better organisation of the agri-food sector, improved attractiveness of farmers for investment and better development of skills tied to the results achieved.

Mr President, Commissioner, the new Cyprus Presidency – we wish you success in your work – ladies and gentlemen, what we have heard today has made it very clear that there is a vast gulf between the position of the Council, which considers the Schengen issue we are discussing today simply to be a legal issue, and, on the other hand, the clear and coherent position of the Commission, which suggests quickly returning to the codecision procedure. The Council deprived us of our say on 6 and 7 June and we are relying on the Council recalling its sense of joint responsibility in this particular case. Schengen is a product of civilisation, a real and, we would say, inalienable achievement: 40 000 km of land borders, almost 800 km of maritime borders, 25 countries involved and 400 million citizens. Citing the supposed problem of public safety is not enough to call into question something that remains an extremely valuable achievement. Schengen, like the single market, is among the few accomplishments of the European Union which we can now say is responsible for there being even partial European citizenship. What is needed is more cooperation, more cooperation in policing and judicial terms, responsibility and solidarity. Parliament wants an open and integrated Europe, where everyone fully plays their part and that is another challenge that we want to achieve with the decisive contribution of the Commission and with a Council that restores solidarity in its relations with Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that a report on the evolution of macro-regional strategies is extremely important because the frame of reference is certainly not just Africa, but all the continents that look out over this crucial area. It is an area that needs resources, infrastructure, partnership and cooperation, through an integration policy that must be developed further in light of what has happened in the area bordering on southern Europe – the so-called Arab Spring, with all the undeniably genuine freedom movements that have not always led to what we would have wished. Lasting stability is still required, however, and could be achieved through a partnership aimed more at young people. Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes with a Euro-Mediterranean focus will provide those areas with a further opportunity for growth and enable many young people to develop work there.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at such a complicated time of spending rationalisation, restraints and restructuring of expenditure, defining a reasonable balanced budget, as our rapporteur Mr La Via has done, is a clear sign of how we can do well even in a context of great difficulty. That said, as the LIBE Committee, we take note of the information that, once received from the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), was then tangibly transposed into positive assessments. I am referring to Frontex, as well as to the question of the Refugee Fund. However, when it comes to the safety of citizens, we believe that in 2013, the bridge year for the next financial perspective, something more tangible needs to be done. I refer, in particular, to that list of political priorities which, Madam President, leaves no reasonable doubt as to the efficacy of the fight against organised crime. In this area, more can probably be done, and we are confident that the same indication can later be drawn up by the Committee on Budgets. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this document, as well as the other document with which it forms the ‘two-pack’, because I believe that they could be important in creating both stability and growth. However, these alone are not enough. In any case, we believe that at a time of serious crisis such as that which the European Union is facing, Parliament should take on an even more courageous role than it has so far, and we believe that development, employment and the labour market go hand in hand with a mechanism for surveillance of the budgetary policy of each Member State, because discipline is extremely important. The European debt redemption fund could prove to be a useful tool, as could the annual coordinated public debt issuance framework. The European Investment Bank has a greater role in order to achieve budgetary, political and fiscal union, which are the essential objectives for growth and development, the need for which we are fully feeling and noticing at the moment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of European company law will undoubtedly determine the future of the European Union itself. One need think only of the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a sector that has gradually grown stronger but that now, more than ever, needs structural reform. The single European market will surely profit from the perspectives of a European company law with a vision. Clearly, this vision must be imparted by the Commission, and it seems to me that the Commissioner’s comments are heading in this direction. We need an action plan with clear, accessible rules, where reducing red tape is given a high profile, and where company law is there to serve SMEs and business in general. At the same time, we also need to look at other important issues, in particular, data protection, which must be updated and continually monitored and which could add to the burden on business. We need action for SMEs, extra safeguards for businesses to guarantee their rights, and cross-border mobility for companies, which must also be guaranteed and supported through an overarching approach aimed at meeting the requirements of company law, SMEs, healthy enterprise and, indeed, the employment market. We therefore trust that Mr Barnier’s proposals will bring company law in step with the times. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that this appointment is an extremely important event or that the European Union should look after the weak and the vulnerable if it wishes to be even more real, authoritative and charismatic. There can be no doubt that choosing a Special Representative for Human Rights is an extremely valuable thing to do. My congratulations of course go to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on the outstanding work he has done. Solidarity, accountability and cooperation: the Member States that put these qualities into practice need to be consistently supported, and we also need to impose conditions favouring those third countries that show particular interest in, and pay attention to, the protection of fundamental rights. That is with regard to trade relations. On the subject of immigration, we still have a number of unresolved issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights for people who flee their native countries because they can see their interests and needs being trampled on there. We need to treat these people with great respect as well. It is a question of natural rights, rights that are inherent to the individual and closely linked to the growth of his or her personality. The European Union must therefore ensure that this role is fulfilled as effectively as possible. The person who is chosen must have two qualities: charisma and courage, and must believe wholeheartedly in the job he or she is appointed to do. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at this time of great difficulty, with such an overwhelming financial and economic crisis, the Commissioner might feel there are other policy priorities to debate and discuss. Because otherwise, the issue of multilingualism, the issue of cultural wealth, the issue of democratic participation should already have been effectively resolved, but they have not. The European Union undoubtedly has union at a monetary level, while it does not yet at a fiscal or political level, and there is no doubt that the denial of rights of citizenship includes denial of the right to participation and information. What should consultation be for, if not to provide a procedure, a tool to help citizens understand what is happening and, through the occasional heated exchange of ideas, through proper debate, to come up with concrete proposals for the decisions that will then be taken by the European institutions? Standing between the goal and the procedures that have been identified, there is probably a strong political will on the part of the Commission. Yet there are a number of innovative opportunities, including websites, there are a number of tangible opportunities that could ensure that the cultural wealth – which should be encouraged – has a tangible opportunity for growth. Otherwise, there will not be much point in further extending the boundaries of the European Union, and it will not be possible to guarantee the social cohesion that is created through an open challenge towards the territory. It is true, we must combine the instrument of political consultations with the effectiveness of parliamentary activities in the best possible way, and we still need to make optimum use of resources in a context where they need to be used rationally. Nevertheless, Madam President, if Parliament really wishes to be the home for all EU citizens, much more needs to be done and we call upon the Commission to make a great effort in this direction. Salvatore Iacolino,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, I take note of the speeches by Mr Gerbrandy, whom I congratulate, and the Commissioner. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I can only welcome the inclusion in the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of many of the suggestions made in our report from the Committee on International Trade. There is no doubt that, in the context of the EU’s external dimension, trade in environmental goods and services is an instrument of particular significance for economic and social development. In particular, the opening up of the markets to highly energy-efficient goods and services plays a role in Europe’s conscientious growth in terms of exports, the creation of new jobs related to the spread of new green technologies, and innovation and competitiveness for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In our opinion, we have reaffirmed the importance of some essential elements in future European bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements: the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services; the inclusion of a section on sustainability; the inclusion of tariff preferences for environmental goods and services produced within the Generalised System of Preferences; not to mention the simplification of procedures. The European Union must maintain its global leadership in protecting the environment and promoting, through trade, the use of green goods, services and technologies in third countries for truly sustainable global growth. We must, Commissioner, particularly in relation to third countries, encourage the conclusion of trade agreements consistent with the proposed energy efficiency measures, thus ensuring deliberate, smart growth within the European Union.

OECD data on youth unemployment in the EU, which stands at around 22%, contrast with the provisions of Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out a number of actions at European level regarding young people, their education, employment and vocational training. Initiatives for growth, in this sense, are fundamental factors in the coordinated and harmonious development of the EU single market. Intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth are three main objectives for developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation and, at the same time, fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. These objectives are pursuable only through effective and efficient use of EU funds, in particular, the Structural Funds, of which EUR 82 billion remains unspent, much of which could be aimed at young people, in particular through small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby contributing to the creation of employment opportunities. I am therefore in favour of a future policy providing opportunities for young people by identifying further and more ambitious funding sources to help them to cope with high youth unemployment. I also consider it essential to allocate significant resources when drawing up the 2014-2020 financial framework, focusing on young people who are not in employment, education or training. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union’s internal security strategies are undoubtedly a fundamental reference point for protecting citizens. It is equally clear, however, that if this section is not allocated sufficient resources to enable these important objectives to be enacted, then security will remain – as it has thus far – a possible but somewhat indefinite option. Recent events show that security must be guaranteed not only through significant resource allocations but also through strong cooperation based on trust between Member States. The fight against organised crime and terrorism requires strong solidarity between Member States, safeguards for the licit economy, and robust law enforcement against all transnational threats. This demands a prevention-based approach, including border protection and effective enforcement measures to combat organised crime, mafias and terrorism. It is a challenge which, together, we can win. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, I have supported the de Jong report because it takes account, above all, of a valuable principle: that of the specific character and history of each nation and thus the substantive criminal law of each Member State. It is also concerned with protecting fundamental rights, respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and – in a European Union intent on dealing a real and fatal blow to organised crime, terrorism and corruption – allowing the judicial rulings issued by one Member State to be recognised in the others. In addition, it talks about the goal of harmonisation, with all the premises stated thus far, the definition of offences common to Member States and those guarantees for accused persons, especially under cross-examination, that may become the symbol of a common criminal law in the EU.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction plays a crucial role in respect of a priority which should perhaps be supported more strongly and incisively by the European Parliament, and that is the battle against drugs and drug addiction, at a time when addiction is not limited to drugs and psychotropic substances, because there are other addictions that should and could be better tackled through a list of actions that the European Union should support. To go back to the assessment, we found that the financial management was properly carried out, and we believe that in the financial perspectives for 2014-2020, more resources should be allocated to a context in which adolescence is often subject to serious attack. Information sharing on the web is important, as are Facebook and the Internet, but these, too, can sometimes lead to specific types of addiction. The monitoring centre could propose improvements for supporting multilingualism and we believe that it can improve its work, which is extremely positive, still further by introducing flexible measures in organisational terms. Stronger ties, which, in actual fact, already exist, with other agencies and with the Member States would allow us to confirm that the prospects for growth in this delicate area exist, based on a principle and value which is that of an overall strategy on addiction, and therefore not just on addiction to drugs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight months have now elapsed since we went to Lampedusa, in Sicily, to note and observe at first-hand what had happened during a year of increasing migration flows. However, the tragedies that have taken place in this period have not come to an end one little bit; quite the contrary. Even now, and already since April, other tragedies are being played out: 10 refugees have died en route
, which is a worrying sign from which we can clearly deduce that not everything that might have been done up till now has been done. We have a priority, which is to ensure that this House and the European institutions are seriously committed to three values – solidarity, responsibility and also courage. The Council, no less than the Commission, should probably have been much more courageous. To begin with, this is the case in the negotiations that must deliver more resources in the 2013 budget and the new 2014-2020 financial framework precisely for the protection and security of the EU’s territory, and in the meantime, in cooperation with third countries, remembering the good work done by Frontex, which can and must be improved. There are priorities that cannot be asked of others: bilateral agreements with border countries cannot be put in place by individual Member States. We should like to know what stage the agreement with Libya has reached and whether progress has been made with Tunisia and Egypt. What is more, when it comes to readmission, we need to ensure that readmission, wherever possible, can take place in the territory of origin. The Mediterranean is a thousand-year-old area where the bonds of peace have always existed between the countries on its shores. Now more than ever, however, we have a prospect in which individual Member States cannot cope with an emergency that is European. It is Europe that must take on the burden: strongly, enthusiastically, passionately, immediately and without delay. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE
),

 The tendency shown by the European Commission to focus attention on major hub airports is in complete contrast with the need for connection of areas such as islands and outermost regions, which need full accessibility and territorial integration due to their physical and natural characteristics. Equally, it is important for the European Commission to review Decision 2012/21/EU on the application of Article 106, in order to better understand the vital importance of the impact of these investments on territorial cohesion and social and economic development, especially in regions where other forms of transport are lacking. Furthermore, EU cofinancing by the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), cohesion and regional funds would allow regional airports to play a leading role in the creation of a wider European Common Aviation Area and therefore, during its review of the TEN-T, the Commission needs to recognise the vital link between regional air services and economic regeneration. I therefore remain convinced that future trans-European network policy must guarantee the mobility of people and goods and make regions, including peripheral regions, more attractive, as a practical contribution to revitalising investments and employment in the Single European Market. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, human trafficking is without doubt a heinous crime, but it is also a crime of transnational proportions. Eradicating it requires international cooperation between Member States and third countries, with a pre-eminent role for the EU institutions. We must overcome the exploitation inherent in prostitution, illegal labour and micro-criminality. However, talking about human trafficking without talking about organised crime would be to take a partial approach to such a worrying phenomenon, since human trafficking is very often controlled by organised crime. In the last few days we saw the establishment of the Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (CRIM), of which I am the rapporteur. One of our guiding principles and political priorities will no doubt be to make the very most of our work so as to achieve greater collaboration and cooperation with third countries, because we think that regular and legal migration should be encouraged, while illegal migration should be countered strongly and – if we can manage it – eradicated. We therefore need bilateral agreements between the EU and individual third countries on regulating migratory flows, protecting basic freedoms through strong guarantees, and the involvement of Europol and Frontex in particular. All of which must be done in the pursuit of two principles – solidarity and responsibility – without which there is no way there will be any progress. That is also the overarching direction that we will be giving to the CRIM Committee, and the fact that a directive shortly to be transposed in all the Member States is an essential tool in the fight against human trafficking tells us just how much difference a strong European approach could make to this worrying and ongoing phenomenon.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes a year after another, essentially identical debate. One year ago Lampedusa was overrun, as was the case in Greece this year and in previous years. Mr Busuttil made the point not long ago: 60 000 people came to Lampedusa, but certainly had no intention of staying there. These migrants – economic migrants – arrive in Italy, Greece and Malta, not by any means to stay there but rather to move on to other EU Member States. The answer to this is more Europe, more responsibility, more solidarity and enterprise. Negotiations have been opened on the funds for this area of action over the 2014-2020 planning period and might I suggest that Ms Malmström steps in there, just as the Council is pushing for a more enterprising approach. There is no doubt that there are some obstreperous Member States. What we need to do is overcome this attitude, otherwise Europe will not make any progress in this regard. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Education means using intelligent methods to give expression to each person’s intrinsic potential. Increasing education, training and research is a cornerstone of growth and modernisation in higher education. However, the success of tertiary education also depends on policies to improve the social inclusion of minorities, gender equality and cutting the number of school-leavers. On top of these goals, there is the aim of encouraging institutions to systematically integrate mobility for education purposes within their programmes. Suitable funding is, however, required in order to achieve this: currently it is just 1.3% of gross domestic product, compared with 2.7% in the USA. Language skills are, moreover, in high demand among businesses and good skills in this area improve job prospects. Also connected to this is the equally important subject of e
-learning: the fusion of education and computer literacy, which provides innovative ways for teaching new generations. Europe’s future strength in this area will depend on putting higher education at the heart of innovation, creating jobs and employable skills, and on the ability of higher education institutions to play a full role in the knowledge triangle: connecting teaching, research and business to boost excellence and regional development.

 I voted in favour because I firmly believe that Europe must support the winds of freedom blowing through the Mediterranean, with a strategic commitment to promoting democracy, by means of urgent, concrete help. In this regard, I believe that establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy could be one of the most tangible responses by the European Union to the challenges of democratisation in our neighbourhood. The Arab Spring showed Europe the great aspirations towards democracy of the Mediterranean populations, as well as the urgency of addressing the instability generated by undemocratic regimes in the EU’s neighbourhood. In particular, the events we have witnessed have been surprising for the role played by civil society and the power of popular protest. For this reason, I am very much in favour of the bottom-up approach that will guarantee direct support to civil society. However, this instrument will only be able to operate effectively if clear and transparent rules are adopted for the distribution of funds, inspired by an across-the-board involvement of civil society and pluralistic support for parties and associations.

 Free movement is one of the EU’s most cherished achievements, which is also confirmed by the fact that 88% of European citizens (interviewed) recognise it as the most familiar of the four freedoms introduced by the EU. The programmes relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with increased synergy with other EU programmes, can undoubtedly help to give new impetus to the concept of European citizenship and to dismantle the obstacles that are still restricting it. Accordingly, the proper functioning of the single market is based on dismantling the obstacles to economic and social cohesion in the EU, which can be achieved, as the Commission has reiterated, by updating Directive 2005/36/EC in order to allow for the swifter, less bureaucratic recognition of professional qualifications. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must represent an additional opportunity for Europe to dismantle the further obstacles that still prevent European citizens from fully enjoying their rights as European citizens, and help to build a single market at the service of citizens. Finally, it should be emphasised that while EU citizenship is often considered secondary to national citizenship, it can be used as a ‘preparatory citizenship’ for non-EU citizens who meet certain conditions, such as ‘good conduct’.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, though it may have taken a long time to reach an agreement, there is no doubt that this programme constitutes an instrument of great solidarity and for this reason its success must be warmly welcomed. We are of the opinion that joint resettlement is a great opportunity of redemption for many desperate people looking for protection, people who come from extremely difficult situations and who deserve a willingness on our part that is not just formal but tangible and substantive. There must be a responsible contribution from Member States, given that this is on a voluntary basis. Eurostat has in recent days announced the data: over 300,000 applications. I am pleased to note that the country that ranks first in accepting applications for humanitarian protection is Italy, a country which once again needs the constructive backing of the European Union because, as you will know, landings in Lampedusa have started again on a massive and significant scale. The Italian Government must do a lot, but this tangible backing from the European Union also needs to be there. We are of course opposed to illegal migratory flows, which must be firmly opposed because they are often in the hands of organised crime syndicates, and we are looking at a time period of 2013, and then at 2014-2020, in order to ensure that resettlement programmes may become a real and tangible goal. We would like to acknowledge the rapporteur, on the one hand, and Commissioner Malmström, on the other, for working so hard on this matter. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a joint motion for a resolution on a subject of particular importance – that of discrimination, of aversion to those who must in fact be integrated and welcomed where there is clearly a chance of work or reuniting a family – is undoubtedly helpful. European citizenship is a subject of extraordinary value. We certainly need to be conscious of it; we need to give new life to the theme of reception and integration; we need to bear in mind that there are directives – Directive 2004/38/EC, which is essential in this respect – and while we are working on celebrations for 2013, the designated European Year of Citizens, all this is why we need to remove every obstacle that hitherto has specifically caused these difficulties. In the meantime, the Internet, while it is a key means of knowledge, must definitely be linked to a series of essential requirements to which its users should adhere. Thank you.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important requirement and one that must be supported, just as we must support the advancement of the status of women, not only in the workplace. Important progress has been made in recent decades, including through absolutely cutting-edge EU legislation. Sixty per cent of our graduates are women but there is no doubt that accessing the world of work is tricky when women choose family life as well as work. The family needs to be safeguarded and protected, while the gender gap definitely has to be significantly reduced through well-defined social policies, greater working flexibility and, of course, by protecting vulnerable women. Let us remember that when it comes to trafficking in human beings, it is often women who are the victims, which is also an important subject to which yet further attention must be paid.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have listened carefully to the indications from the Commission about reinforcing judicial training. There is no doubt that this is a top priority, because we believe that the judicial training of magistrates and judicial practitioners serves not only to bring the various legal systems closer together – though they must remain distinct due to the typical characteristics of each – but certainly this mutual tangible cooperation can certainly facilitate what, today more than ever, is the transnational dimension of the law: lawyers, judicial practitioners, who must be supported by a common and consistent judicial training sector, possibly through exchanges via Erasmus, so as to set out an area of freedom, justice and security in which each component can make its own voice heard in a common European market in which competitiveness and sustainability are closely linked to a system of free movement of professions, in which it is important to have high quality assurance standards. For this reason, it is important to have a European professional card, a sort of European accreditation, in a context in which trust – as set out in the Stockholm Programme between the various Member States – should be based on a tangible mutual recognition of judicial orders, so that entry of young judicial practitioners onto the labour market can be facilitated and so that those who have the ability to use more than one language ​can be taken into account. There is still a role for the most important agencies in a context in which the financial perspectives of the 2014-2020 budget will have to be characterised not only by important and significant pilot projects, such as the one that has just been mentioned, but by appropriate and adequate resources so as to expand the number of people benefiting from this programme. Thank you. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that family reunification is an issue of substance, one that is serious and concrete. The welfare of the family must take precedence over anything else, even if it is, of course, undeniable that this right must be subject to rules. In my opinion, the 2003 directive contains useful rules, though they must be applied uniformly and homogeneously within the territory of all Member States. For this reason, the Commission has quite rightly initiated a serious debate by publishing a Green Paper, in which it sets out a clear vision: to introduce concrete measures in support of a process of family reunification which, in my opinion, simply has to be taken into account. I am the rapporteur of a document on information and communications technology, on the transfer of workers who are third-country nationals to establishments located both in third countries and in Europe. In this particular case, a more favourable exception clause was carried in committee to ensure family reunification at a practical level, which is definitely a political priority for the European People’s Party. Of course, language is important, and we must ensure that the European agenda on migratory flows – again in this case we are speaking of legal immigration – takes account of this directive, which is absolutely correct and practical. The Commission’s goal must be to urge Member States to adopt rules that can and will be applied in practice and, at the same time, ensure that the right to be together is truly recognised, one to which no one can object. The PPE’s aim is to ensure that the 500 000 individuals who are potential beneficiaries of this rule are given due consideration by Member States. Susy De Martini  (ECR

 I voted in favour of this report for which I was shadow rapporteur for the ECR Group. However, I believe that it fails to adequately balance the importance of strong bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and the EU with legitimate concerns over the Kingdom’s human rights record. Instead, the report is almost entirely dominated by the latter. In fact, the report does not adequately recognise progress made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in some aspects of human rights and equality, in particular with regard to the role of women. The report also does not properly consider the important role played by Saudi Arabia in counter-terrorism or EU-Saudi trade relations. I therefore feel that, while I am able to vote in favour of the report, I also consider it to be a missed opportunity to engage positively with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, stressing our existing relations with it as a key strategic partner in the region, proposing measures to strengthen EU-Saudi links, and also to work constructively with them to improve their human rights record.

Madam President, I must say to Baroness Ashton, as a physician and a human being, that I have a specific concern, namely about so-called ‘Cuban health diplomacy’. Cuba is sending out doctors under government-to-government cooperation agreements. This practice has now become Cuba’s biggest industry, bringing in USD 6 billion. In Venezuela alone, there are more than 30 000 Cuban doctors, traded for oil; in Brazil there are 6 000 of them. The host countries pay for each doctor about USD 5 000 per month, while the doctors themselves receive only USD 25. These bilateral agreements clearly violate a number of International Labour Organisation conventions. One of the escaped Cuban doctors recently stated, ‘We are the highest qualified slave labour force in the world.’ Are we sure that we should continue to finance Cuba, with EUR 30 million each year?

Signora Presidente, l'Iniziativa dei cittadini europei, particolarmente importante in questo momento di sfiducia nei confronti dell'Europa, sembra avere qualche problema di comunicazione e burocratico, com'è già stato rilevato dalla signora Commissario e da altri colleghi. Faccio un esempio pratico su tutti, che riguarda proprio il mio paese, l'Italia: l'Iniziativa sull'acqua pubblica ha raccolto, dopo nove mesi, poco più di 25.000 firme sulle 54.000 necessarie per l'Italia, mentre sullo stesso soggetto, a livello di referendum 
nazionale, erano state raccolte nel 2011, quindi poco fa, in pochi mesi più di un milione di firme. Questa discrepanza di successo fra l'iniziativa di un singolo Stato e quella europea non può essere spiegata se non con le esistenti difficoltà di comunicazione e di ordine burocratico. So che è stata presentata un'iniziativa per semplificare questo diritto d'iniziativa. Sembra un gioco di parole, ma è una realtà che mi fa venire in mente questa frase "Un cammello è l'esatta descrizione di un cavallo fatta da un burocrate". Spero proprio che la Commissione possa porre un veloce rimedio a quanto sta accadendo.Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Sonik had a long and complex task, and overall we should welcome his report. However, it is clear that there are still many doubts about extraction of shale gas and oil. The other speeches we have heard also share this view, in particular with regard to environmental and public health protection. I therefore welcome the series of studies undertaken by the European Commission on potential risks resulting from shale gas extraction. Only on the basis of their results will we be able to give a clear answer and be in a position to adopt a new EU framework Directive for regulating mining activities. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, this proposal for a regulation aims to simplify the current legal framework and to establish new administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, of which there are currently around 30 million in Europe. Until now, the 2002 Framework Directive and 14 other directives referring to it set out the requirements in a rather convoluted legislative framework that is happily being replaced by a consolidated text. A refined vehicle categorisation achieved by introducing more appropriate subcategories, more severe emission limits, the mandatory introduction of anti-lock brake systems on some types of vehicle and the automatic headlight-on system to improve the visibility of L-vehicles are just some of the innovations to be introduced thanks to this report. The benefits to be gained in terms of safety, environmental protection and improved functioning of the internal market are beyond doubt and because of this I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 In a parliamentary democracy, the link between the public nature of debates and votes, and democratic accountability, is inescapable. If we do not give European citizens the ability to know what their elected representatives have said and how they voted, I wonder whether they will be able to hold them to account at the next elections. The review of Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure, through the incorporation of some key elements of the Code of conduct for negotiating in the context of the ordinary legislative procedures in the binding part of the Rules, will make the procedures more effective, more transparent and above all more inclusive. I am convinced that the excellent job done and the measures the report contains will increase transparency and therefore the accountability of the elected representatives at European level.

The statistics for 2011 show that no Member has ever requested the translation of the entire verbatim report of proceedings in his or her own language. This was a pointless, superfluous expense that should quite rightly be restricted. I fully agree with the solutions explained in the report and with the work done by Mr Ilchev.

 A Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) on 29 April 2008 between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, was signed in Luxembourg. The Commission has proposed an Implementing Regulation to facilitate the application of the Interim Agreement, which lays down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements. Mr Winkler felt that the amendments to the Commission proposal under examination should mirror the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I report. I agree with the rapporteur because this will guarantee the consistency and coherence of the European Parliament’s position on the matter. Consequently the report contains amendments aimed at aligning the amended provisions with the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I Regulation to the five Regulations on the application of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements with the other Western Balkan countries.

 The right of a citizen of an unrepresented Member State to seek assistance from the consular authorities of other Member States that are represented is one of the rights conferred by EU citizenship. It is a right that has existed for some years, but European citizens are still not fully informed of it. As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am more than satisfied with the work done on this report. I believe that the measures adopted will improve the enforcement of this right, through better coordination between Member States on consular representation.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr La Via on his excellent work on the report on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013. His task was difficult, and there seemed little likelihood of an agreement between the Member States and the European Parliament. Despite the prolonged period of crisis and constant requests for cuts to EU expenditure, Mr La Via and Mr Vaughan together managed to ensure continuity for current policies and initiatives. I think it was particularly important that any slowing down of the pilot projects in the areas of energy and the environment was avoided, a clear sign of the good work carried out by the European Parliament in defending the prerogatives of the European Union. I have therefore given my full support to this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with I would like to recall that the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 are proceeding in a very difficult social, economic and financial context. I regret to say that the European Union is increasingly seen by citizens as an additional burden to be borne by taxpayers, rather than an important resource. I am convinced that this situation is caused by the fact that the EU budget is not in line with national budgets, since it has not been expanded to take account of the duties and competencies assigned to the Union under the Treaty of Lisbon, or of the important political Decisions taken by the European Council. I voted in favour of the report because I was aware of the need to reach an interinstitutional compromise and to send a clear signal to citizens. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Commission’s proposal to amend Article 103o of the Single CMO Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007), which provides for the possibility for Member States to grant decoupled aid to vine growers under the single payment scheme (SPS), definitely needed to be amended. I endorse Mr Dorfmann’s work and the proposals he put forward, as they ensure farmers receive predictable payments of aid. The report also effectively confronts the current changing situation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. Above all, it was important to avoid Member States planning five-year decisions that are actually not compatible with the Commission’s proposal for a new system of direct support, just as it was essential to link the calendar for the final transfer decision to the calendar of the future reform. All these problems were considered in the report and the solutions reached are very positive. This is why I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has been in use since 2008 as a free service to Member States with a view to improving the exchange of information within the internal market. To date, the IMI system still operates on the basis of a Commission decision and a Commission recommendation and, as a result, lacks a single legal instrument. This has been a major obstacle to further expansion of the IMI system, which should have been overcome long ago. We have seen that the system has worked perfectly with regard to the Professional Qualifications Directive and the Services Directive. The system has proven its value as a rapid and secure means for cross-border information exchange and administrative cooperation with currently over 6 000 registered authorities in all EU Member States and EEA (European Economic Area) countries. Therefore, I welcome the report’s proposals and I hope that the expansion in IMI application to other sectors will have clear benefits for citizens and for the internal market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation No 73/2009, which provides the rules for the current system of direct payments to farmers, will be superseded by other proposals under the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform for 2014-2020 In its proposals for the multiannual financial framework and the CAP for 2014-2020, the Commission is proposing to make use of a new crisis reserve to address additional financing needs resulting from unexpected agricultural crises. The net ceiling in 2013 for EU Member States would be equal to the value of the net ceiling in 2012, with the adjustments deriving from grubbing-up in 2012 and the appraised transfer of the wine envelopes to the single payment scheme. I agree with the solution contained in the report and therefore I voted in favour of Mr Capoulas Santos’s proposal, because I think we need to maintain the current financial structure for 2013 in order to ensure continued levels of payments and to support agricultural development in an effective way. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting animal welfare standards is part of and complementary to sustainable development policy. European institutions, as signatories to the agreement on sustainable development, must do all they can to ensure these standards are adequate. The deterioration in the state of health of wild animals could result in an increased spread of contagious diseases to domestic animals and, at the same time, have an adverse effect on public health; I voted in favour of Ms Paulsen’s proposal, since I think the current regulations need to be better enforced, with special focus on the animal transport sector. I welcome the inclusion in the strategy of a European animal welfare framework law and join in Ms Paulsen’s call for this law to be clearly formulated, followed by a consultation with all relevant parties.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until now, the Commission has been financing programmes such as MED 2007-2013 and the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument for cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Now that the 2007-2013 financial programming period is coming to an end, I think we need to ask the Commission to start a process of dialogue and consultation in order to define future macro-regional strategies. Priority areas to be targeted by future support still have to be identified, and that must be done while taking into account the need to strengthen existing cooperation, particularly between areas of Europe belonging to different Member States but sharing the same services and working area. I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s motion for a resolution because I consider the Mediterranean to be a coherent whole, a single cultural and environmental area in which joint priorities such as crops, renewable energy sources and tourism can be shared. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a single European railway area provides a major opportunity to support economic recovery and make the single market more competitive. The variety of national railway systems hampers this process: numerous legislative barriers slow down development in the sector and limit the competitiveness of rail transport. We should establish transparent rules on access to rail-related services and service facilities, such as freight terminals, maintenance facilities and marshalling yards. Ms Serracchiani’s report is a step in that direction, and that is why I voted for it. The Council is calling for too long a period – up to 36 months – for this new directive to enter into force. Accordingly, I endorse the rapporteur’s request to set a period of 12 months for the transposition of the entire directive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by improving the harmonised control of driving time and rest periods, digital tachographs can play a vital role in ensuring that the internal road haulage market functions properly, which will greatly benefit road safety. A number of recent police reports from certain Member States have shown that fraudulent use of these devices has risen, and therefore a change to the regulation in force is urgently required. According to the Commission, the increased cost of purchasing a new tachograph is expected to be around EUR 5 per vehicle, which is negligible compared with the potential benefits that could accrue. I voted in favour of Ms Ţicău’s proposal because I believe tachographs and vehicle satellite tracking systems should be synchronised to make services more efficient and more reliable. The ability to transmit tachograph data remotely will also lead to better control and a substantial improvement in road safety. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we look back at some of the serious environmental disasters we are all familiar with, we can see that there have been numerous cases where disastrous environmental consequences have followed industrial accidents. These cases also show that at times the impact of accidents can extend beyond national borders. I have voted in favour of my fellow Member’s proposal since I believe Directive 96/82/EC must be replaced so that the existing protection levels are not only maintained, but strengthened. I also think that the new provisions should be clearer, consistent and easily understandable, in order to contribute to the streamlining of administrative procedures. Finally, I would argue it is necessary to keep a certain amount of flexibility to be able to amend Annex I to deal with any unwanted effects of the alignment to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and any subsequent adjustments to that regulation that could have an impact on the classification of dangerous substances.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses establishes general provisions regarding the composition and manufacture of said foods. This directive’s provisions mostly date back to 1977 and no longer meet the needs of today's consumers. Therefore an in-depth revision of the directive was needed and for this reason I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s proposal. I would still argue that it is absolutely necessary to protect consumers more, simplify regulations and tackle the difficulties that Member States and operators encounter in interpreting the various existing pieces of food legislation. This would mean similar products could be treated in the same way throughout the Union, creating a level playing field for all internal market operators and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and end-consumers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to the development of the economy and society. However, to make the most of these potentials, first they need to be made secure. The many disputes regarding existing legislation on data privacy and intellectual property rights enforced in the Internet environment should give us much food for thought. I supported Mr Kalfin’s proposal because I believe that the potential offered by the web, in terms of both innovation and growth for European enterprises, must not be lost, especially in a highly competitive context such as currently exists at global level. Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that I believe in the need for a rapid implementation of the European programme for critical information infrastructure protection (ECIP), including the creation of the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to climate change, the steady rise in environmental pollution, industrialisation and the increasing population growth, we are facing global energy challenges. I believe it would be useful to strengthen the external dimension of EU energy policy by taking a clear stance on the diversification of energy sources and routes. I voted in favour of Ms Herczog’s proposal because I think it is essential to guarantee security of supply and, at the same time, to support sustainable production and consumption. I firmly hope, however, that in the future, we will have greater coordination between Member States’ policies and joint action and solidarity in the field of external energy policy and energy security. In this respect, we must recognise the importance of transparency and implementation of the internal energy market. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted for this resolution in the belief that introducing new taxes will not, in itself, solve our problems; nevertheless, the introduction of certain taxes may lead to a reduction in taxation in other sectors. The financial sector is not contributing in a fair way to the cost of the global crisis at a time when EU citizens are faced with an increase in direct and indirect taxation and severe cuts in wages and pensions. The financial sector is still exempted from taxation in its activities and transactions. I therefore support Ms Podimata’s proposal, which envisages a taxation rate of 0.1% in respect of transactions other than those related to derivatives arrangements, and 0.01% in respect of transactions related to derivatives arrangements, which would generate new revenues of EUR 57 billion at EU level. I have one final comment to make: I would point out that, according to a Eurobarometer poll carried out in June 2011, a large majority of EU citizens are in favour of bringing in these measures. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the single market was conceived as a vital tool for steering Europe towards sustainable growth and full employment. If fully developed, it could provide a useful antidote to the economic crisis that has gripped Europe and the world for several years now. To that end, its supporting directives need to be properly transposed, applied and implemented. I therefore agree with Mr Busuttil’s proposals, which emphasise the need to implement these directives in order to be able to exploit the single market’s economic potential. The SOLVIT network has been shown to be a useful, effective tool for providing clear, timely solutions for citizens and businesses, thus helping to solve the problems associated with the misapplication of competition rules. As a non-judicial entity, the network is ideally placed to operate economically and effectively. I therefore hope that SOLVIT will be further reinforced and promoted to European citizens. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, despite Turkey’s recent efforts and progress, culminating in the meeting between the Turkish Minister for Family and Social Policies and representatives from the Committee on Equal Opportunities, a number of important outstanding gender equality issues remain. Given that Turkey is a candidate country, the present gap will have to be bridged completely for it to be able to achieve current European Union standards. I am concerned, in particular, by the recent data on the safety and protection of women. It emerges that 39% of Turkish women have been attacked at least once in their lives. I agree with Mr Bozkurt’s proposal to encourage the Turkish Government to act swiftly to implement the measures needed to reduce the number of attacks. Finally, I would like to stress the importance of access to information and to education in ensuring gender mainstreaming at all educational levels. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the potential afforded by the new channels of communication is huge. In a world in which everything is digital, information is an asset for every European citizen. The European Union needs to protect all end users and try to reduce the existing disparities between Member States on the European market to a minimum. I would like to point out that, as the promoter of a single internal market, the European Union must also implement an internal telecommunications market. The significant differences between domestic and roaming prices obviously make these difficult goals to meet. I agree with Ms Niebler’s proposal. Each home provider must give customers clear and adequate information about the levels of consumption they have reached and agreed. Transparent information about the conclusion of contracts and the charges for data roaming services will be an appropriate means for protecting European consumers and I therefore voted in favour of the report.

 The European Union has a crucial role in European environmental policy. By signing Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, entering into the Rotterdam Convention, the EU has set itself the goal of incentivising and increasing information exchange about the chemicals traded between the parties to the convention and also to implement the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. The measure ensures that exporting countries of chemicals formally obtain consent from the importing countries before the export can take place. Mr Jørgensen’s proposal aims to limit the derogations usually adopted against the PIC procedure, thereby trying to defend the original meaning of the Convention. The joint intervention of the Commission and the designated national authorities will also be of significant help. This synergy will undoubtedly result in more accurate and reliable documentation on the possible impact on human health or the environment of using dangerous chemical substances in the importing country or another exporting country.

 Despite the fact that the situation in Myanmar is still far from what international institutions – the European Union in the first place – expect for the future, the progress achieved by the nation under the leadership of President Thein Sein can be seen by one and all. A political process has begun that has given rise to a series of radical changes: the satisfactory outcome of the by-elections held on 1 April; the release of a significant number of political prisoners; the adoption of a series of legislative and governmental measures aimed at increasing openness, from the initiation of economic reforms to the easing of press and Internet censorship and the promulgation of laws on freedom of association and the freedom to strike; and the initiation of a process of dialogue with the main ethnic groups. While recognising the still undeveloped context in which this process of opening and national reconciliation is taking place, the transition from a military to a civilian government and the democratic opposition’s possibility to be represented are basic aspects. Finally, I would like to emphasise that, in this sense, it was the firm diplomatic actions of Italy, Germany and France that led to the gradual easing of EU sanctions and to a gradual evolution of political and democratic structures in Burma.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps there has been an error in communication, but I had asked to speak to explain my vote. In the past decade we have witnessed a series of well-known dramatic events which have led to a consequent increase in the number of controls and restrictions in air travel. Meanwhile, the European Union, the USA, Canada and Australia have signed a variety of international agreements on the processing and storage of passenger data. Parliament already expressed its willingness to revise such agreements in May 2010, when it decided to reject the outcome of the negotiations between the countries involved. I am aware of the fact that the competent parliamentary committee has judged this agreement unsuitable, nonetheless I think it is more useful to maintain this new agreement, rather than referring to the current legislation. Since it is not possible to start new negotiations, it would be better to adopt these new measures and improve the previous framework with regard to data protection and the respect for individual rights. The rejection of these new results would deprive Europe of any minimum law in this field, and of any effective tool in combating terrorism and organised crime. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its Member States have always promoted sustainable development and the protection of the environment and human health. The signing of the Kyoto Protocol and the Europe 2020 strategy are among the most important challenges that the EU has set itself. Taxation related to CO2
 emissions is a cost-effective means for Member States to achieve the reductions of greenhouse gasses necessary according to Decision 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. I am in favour of Ms Lulling’s proposal on the need to ensure that the internal market functions in an optimum manner in a context of new requirements relating to the limitation of climate change, to the use of renewable energy sources and to energy savings. Consistent treatment of energy sources should be guaranteed in order to provide a genuine level playing field for energy consumers regardless of the energy source used. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the approval of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World and the resolution on the EU’s support for the International Criminal Court, the European Parliament voted to act in a manner consistent and in conformity with EU obligations concerning the protection of human rights. Implementing national strategies already drawn up in recent months will be an important step in this direction. I agree with Mr Howitt’s proposal to call on the Commission to insert a ‘torture end-use’ clause into the 2005 Council Regulation concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture, etc. This would enable Member States to acquire detailed information and decide whether or not to refuse the export of the goods and substances in question.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have witnessed fast economic growth on the part of Azerbaijan, whose economic potential is obvious to all. We must also recognise that there has been a strengthening of the strategic role of that country as an Eastern partner, in particular, in the energy sector. However, we must remember here that the gap in terms of democracy and the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights compared to the standards required by the European Union has not yet been completely bridged. I believe that these principles should be considered essential for the proper conduct of the negotiations and the stipulation of an association agreement with Azerbaijan. I hope that the Council and the Commission will be urging the Azerbaijani authorities to adopt an anti-discriminatory legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Meanwhile, we should welcome the reforms made by the Azerbaijani authorities in the judiciary in the last year, which should ensure greater independence of judges, and eliminate corruption in this area.

 The principal aim of cohesion policy and of the policy on the internal market is to organise policy initiatives directed towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, encouraging an economy with a high rate of employment that favours social and territorial cohesion. Nevertheless, the initial conditions in which the outermost regions (ORs) find themselves present an obstacle to, and a brake on, achieving the objectives that have been set, in particular, in the Europe 2020 strategy. As the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides, the ORs have a right to be treated differently, which enables them to benefit from the maximum level of aid, irrespective of their level of development. In this sense, I welcome the Commission’s plan to include a budget line for ‘Outermost regions and regions with a very low population density’ in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. I fully agree with the advisability of outermost regions pursuing the main objectives defined in the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I consider that we must emphasise the need to modulate the objectives in accordance with each outermost region’s own situation, taking into account their regional diversity, their structural conditions and their potential benefits.

 The current economic and financial crisis in Europe calls for the adoption of robust, decisive measures to stimulate economic growth. Of course, tax revenue is one of the most important tools with which the Member States can tackle the problems associated with the crisis. I warmly welcome the proposal put forward by Mr Casa. I think that it is essential to create a European fiscal union that includes a comprehensive, rapid, efficient and user friendly exchange of information among Member States in order to improve the fight against tax evasion and to optimise the revenue paid into Member States’ coffers. I hope that we can rise above partisan positions and that common sense will prevail at this difficult time. We must come to an agreement and find new resources in order to deal with the crisis.

 Respect for, and the defence of, human rights and democratic values are the fundamental principles on which the European Union is based. Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: ‘In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women’. On 7 July 2011, the European Parliament welcomed the initiative of establishing the European Endowment for Democracy, as did subsequently the Foreign Affairs Council. I agree with this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation, and I urge the Council to outline the methods for its creation. I believe that establishment of the Endowment could be a tangible and practical response by the European Union to the challenges posed by countries calling for greater democracy. I hope that this can take place as soon as possible, also in view of the timing imposed on us by the ‘Arab Spring’. The situation of instability afflicting the Middle East is clear and before our eyes, and we have to respond to it. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The inclusion of Kosovo in the stabilisation and association process (SAP), thanks to which it could benefit from EU assistance (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, IPA) and an independent preferential trade system, would ensure that Kosovo does not remain on the sidelines of the EU’s strategy in the area of the Western Balkans. In its communication of October 2011 on the enlargement strategy, the Commission showed how the post-election period of adjustment prevented Kosovo from making substantial progress in terms of reforms. On the other hand, in its conclusions of 5 December 2011, the Council called upon Kosovo to implement the actions decided on to compensate for these failings. I agree and support the Commission’s intention to carry out a feasibility study for the stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Kosovo. This commitment confirms the wish and commitment of the EU to carry forward the initiatives outlined in the General Affairs Council conclusions of December 2011 and, at the same time, shows that it can make a significant contribution in socio-political terms, which will be essential for reaching an agreement between Priština and Belgrade on the delicate issue of regional cooperation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before my explanation of vote, I would like to explain that I am wearing this T-shirt because I would like to ask the European Union to take decisive steps to secure the liberation of the two Italian soldiers, Captain Massimiliano Latorre and Sergeant Salvatore Girone, who have been unjustly detained for doing their duty against piracy. Mr President, the new general guidelines of the European Parliament on the 2013 budget will define the guidelines, objectives and strategies to be followed by the Commission when preparing the draft budget. The report in question sets out the key points for reviving the European economy in the light of the effects of, and the issues caused by, the ongoing nature of the economic crisis. I welcome the initiative not just because it makes the EU budget an ideal vehicle for encouraging cohesion between Member States, but also because it embodies an opportunity to review and adapt the new budget to the needs of the economic crisis that has hit the euro area. The initiative proposed by Mr La Via has my full support, and I especially welcome the request made to the Council not to make artificial cuts that do not take into account the effective absorption capacity of the programmes and consequently delay the implementation of cohesion policies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I travelled personally to Macedonia during the last presidential elections as an envoy of the Group of the European People’s Party (PPE) in order to support Prime Minister Gruevski’s electoral campaign. Having met thousands of people, I was able to observe personally that it is not just the institutions but also the people who are decisively in favour of joining the European Union. This is why I believe we cannot put off starting negotiations, which have been suspended, for much longer, and should resume them as a matter of urgency. The 2011 progress report presented by the Commission shows that for the third consecutive year, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has managed to maintain positive progress in line with European standards in terms of political criteria and the development of a market economy. Therefore, I am confident that FYROM will manage to overcome the political and structural limitations that are still holding it back, and give my full support to the resumption of negotiations.

 The recent instalment of the new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 10 February brought an end to the political stalemate that had been created in the country and had stunted its development. This provides an excellent foundation for reviving the European agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among the most significant actions taken by the new government, I should like to point out the initiatives to bring in a census, the adoption of the laws on State aid and the adaptation of the country’s constitution to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I support the motion tabled by Ms Pack: we must urge the Bosnian authorities to make further efforts and take further steps to meet the EU accession criteria. That said, I think it is essential that Bosnia and Herzegovina complies with the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the Sejdić-Finci case and with Article 2 of the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA), which give greater guarantees on human rights and democratic principles. The decision to dissolve the local office of the High Representative is quite correct and I think it will promote a greater sense of responsibility among the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999, with the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European signatory countries committed to working together to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. This target would have guaranteed academic quality, economic development and social cohesion, and employment and lifelong learning for graduates. I support Mr Berlinguer’s report because it calls for decisive and coordinated action at European level. The recognition of degrees based on an efficient system of quality assurance constitutes a good point of departure for encouraging Member States to adopt the national framework of qualifications for lifelong learning. It is essential to implement and develop a European system of higher education that allows and encourages the free movement of knowledge. I think the measures contained in the report represent the right path to follow to make Europe more productive and competitive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that currently, 1.5 billion people in the world are unable to access energy sources. Globally, forecasts indicate that over the next two decades, the funds allocated to energy will amount to USD 26 trillion – just 3% of that sum would ensure universal access to energy by 2030. The proposal put forward by Mr Neuser concerning the possibility of developing and extending access to modern energy services should be a starting point for the EU to begin to address the problem of poverty and sustainable development through targeted, effective action. I agree with Mr Neuser’s proposals: we Europeans must also make our contribution towards improving energy access for the poor in developing countries. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented by Mr Schmidt, which is the Commission’s first initiative in the area of tax, makes a positive contribution to outlining future legislative initiatives on this issue.

In this regard, the Commission’s intention to strengthen the legal framework on savings taxation and the review of taxation on energy products is a positive step. Although Member States have expressed diverging opinions on the validity and efficacy of this initiative, overall, I welcome Mr Schmidt’s report and this is why I decided to support it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schwab’s report shows how EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits for consumers. The use of flexible, dynamic procedures has enabled competition policy to act as a driver and not as an obstacle to the European financial and economic system. I voted in favour of the report as I fully agree with the objectives contained in it. In particular, I support the aim of improving price transparency in order to stimulate competition in the market and protect consumer rights. At a time of recession, we absolutely have to try and incentivise consumers. Finally, I would like to add that the information exchange between the Commission and consumer associations should continue and be stepped up and extended to stakeholders. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The reluctance of Member States to take steps to harmonise some aspects of their respective systems of procedural law does no good for the States themselves or, above all, for European citizens. The ‘by stages’ approach adopted by the Commission is proving to be a winning strategy. However, I think Parliament ought to make itself heard before the Council in order to try and speed up the process for adopting the other directives in this area. Having to talk, in 2011, about rules on the entitlement of suspected and accused persons to be informed of their rights and of the charge against them in criminal proceedings within EU Member States seems, to say the least, like something of an anachronism.

 The legislative vacuum in the EU on protecting victims of crime from further attacks once the victims have left their Member State of origin was a serious and unacceptable flaw in a united Europe.

 I would like to congratulate Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes for their work, both earlier on the parliamentary committee and on the Conciliation Committee. While I understand the Council’s reasons, the situation the Member State economies were in required an austerity-based response, and in this sense, the compromise agreement we have reached is a satisfactory solution. I share Commissioner Lewandowski’s doubts, but I would like to reiterate that the possibility of adopting an amending budget at a later date, should it not be possible to meet the payments, has rightly been included in the joint statement by the Parliament and the Council. Finally, I am pleased that we have managed to honour our promises on the immigration policy appropriations. We cannot predict what repercussions the political situation in the Maghreb may have, and we must be prepared and in possession of the right tools to deal with any emergency. Therefore, I hope the subject can be the subject of debate in this House. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe and its history speak through the huge achievements that have distinguished the development of civilisation in our countries. Much of Europe’s history is told through the roads, the monuments and the convents that, in times of darkness, have given dignity to the journey of the peoples of Europe. I support the stance taken in this measure which, naturally, perhaps ought to be extended to the countries waiting to join the EU, the Western Balkan countries, because I think it would be a good idea to involve them in this project of identifying a European brand. I think their involvement would send out a positive message to them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the railway sector has always been something of a special case, where the competitive ethos of the single market and the European Union has taken root rather late. The deficiencies in the services that this sector offers to citizens are linked precisely to this lateness. I am convinced that more transparent and smoother conditions for accessing the market, together with explicit rules on conflicts of interest and discriminatory practices in the railway sector, will be the right measures to spur on greater competition. I completely agree with the legislative proposal on the complete, mandatory separation between infrastructure managers and businesses operating the transport services, namely train companies. I invite the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on this within the pre-established timeframes. I believe that the measures contained in the report will allow us to make it easier to provide train services, boosting the quality offered to passengers and people using freight services. Ms Serrachiani’s report provides tangible responses to the request for greater liberalisation and competition in the railway sector and accordingly I have given it my full support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s motion is a bold step in the right direction. Despite the austerity required by the Member States and by the domestic budget deficits, the European Union is duty bound to do everything it can to ensure growth and employment in Europe. I completely agree with Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes and therefore voted in favour of the resolution. The crisis must not be tackled solely through austerity measures, but also through investment in research and in the cohesion policy. Administrative costs must be kept in check and Parliament has sent out a clear and firm message on this. I hope, however, that good sense will prevail in the next meeting of the Conciliation Committee. The Council must open its eyes and realise that cutting competitiveness and cohesion will only sink our economy even deeper into the mire. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, although it is important to reduce the emission of gaseous pollutants and pollutants produced by internal combustion engines in non-road mobile machinery, we cannot turn a blind eye to the current situation in which manufacturers find themselves. Since 2008, the financial and economic crisis has hit the non-road mobile machinery sector hard. It was essential for us to further extend the flexibility scheme for the transition from Stage III A to Stage III B. The increase in the number of engines used for application in land-based machines under the flexibility scheme, from 20% to 37.5%, is, in my opinion, an unsatisfactory result for European industry in this sector. However, given the situation and Parliament’s continual delays, manufacturers were demanding a rapid response. I would like to specify that it is for this reason alone that I decided to support the report with my vote. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, fully agree with the general approach of Ms Rühle’s report, and I therefore voted in favour. I am convinced that the measures adopted will provide legal certainty, on the one hand, and clearer rules and more flexible procedures for public procurement, on the other. I endorse Ms Rühle’s view that it is the public procurement directives themselves which are the main impediment to involving public contracting authorities in the pursuit of general social aims: the criterion of the lowest price cannot carry the same weight as that of the most economically advantageous tender. It must be stipulated that contracts are to be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender. Only then will the criteria for selecting what is most economically advantageous be easier to implement. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, European consumers’ confidence in the financial system has been severely tested in the last few months, and the Belgian case is clear evidence of this. I am convinced that the system of compensating the potential losses of consumers in the event of bankruptcy of financial institutions or insurance companies, together with insurance guarantee schemes, could make a precious contribution to reducing the risks of policyholders and beneficiaries. I voted in favour of this report. However, I would like to emphasise that, until now, European consumers have not had access to sufficient information in cases of insurance company insolvency. This information must be easily accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible, but, above all, consumers must be clearly told which authority they can apply to should they need to claim compensation.

 Madam President, the legal mechanism devised as a temporary solution for adapting the value-added tax (VAT) system to the abolition of the internal borders is showing its limitations and shortcomings. There is a high level of exposure to fraud, a problem that must be solved as soon as possible. Furthermore, if we think about the considerable increase in commercial transactions between tradespeople based in different Member States and about the rise in the provision of cross-border services, reform of the VAT system appears obvious and inevitable. I voted for Mr Casa’s report, but I still believe that the reverse charge mechanism needs to be explored further. In particular, we are not currently able to forecast what the effects would be of concentrating the financial risk exclusively on the retailer. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we have been able to establish which new and important powers have been granted to the European Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Commission’s proposals for improved economic governance are crucially important for our economic growth and, in particular, for that of the countries in the euro area. The improvements made by the European Parliament with a view to the creation of a robust and coherent legislative framework are clear. I support the general approach of this report, and accordingly voted in favour of it. We have new responsibilities to shoulder; the package of measures must be further improved and enhanced. I believe that we should focus more on preventing unsustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies, but above all that Parliament should be given a prominent role in the surveillance process, with regular, systematic debates and public hearings held in Parliament itself. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what clearly emerges from this report is that many European regions find it difficult to administer the Structural Funds made available by the Union through its cohesion policies. They often find themselves caught in a maze in which, if the regions succeed in organising the administration of these funds, it is often the national governments that then find it difficult to activate the cofinancing funds. Sometimes it is like a dog chasing its own tail: the money that we consider fundamental for growth and cohesion in Europe cannot then be spent, as it now appears is happening in my own country, Italy, as well. I have therefore voted in favour of this report, but I believe that, on the one hand, we should speed up the adoption of the new economic programming period 2014-2020 to enable the individual Member States and regions of Europe to prepare themselves in time and, on the other, that the cofinancing mechanism should perhaps be reviewed. That could be a way forward and so I have voted in favour, but I think a lot more needs to be done to ensure that European funds can actually be spent to benefit the people. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report shows that the social cost of road accidents is enormous, standing at an estimated EUR 130 billion per year. Mr Koch’s proposals are along the right lines and I particularly support the idea of creating the role of EU road safety coordinator. However, I think that we do need to come up with targets and measures that are far more ambitious than those put forward by the Commission thus far; above all, I think that Parliament ought to make its presence felt to the Commission. We cannot accept the fact that in recent years, the European Union’s budget for road safety measures has been slashed. We are therefore duty-bound to ensure that this trend is reversed as soon as possible and that road safety receives greater funding. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forecasts in Mr Caspary’s report on gross domestic product and export growth in the European Union are truly disheartening. We cannot continue to plan our commercial strategy on the premise that the current situation in international trade will remain. The Global Europe strategy has been a failure and I think that the Commission ought to investigate the reasons behind this. We need critical and detailed analysis, but especially an overview of how to deal with future economic challenges. The commercial policy must be coordinated with the European Union’s other economic policies, but, above all, it needs to be accompanied by a parallel policy to combat the phenomenon of population decline. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced countless innovations, including one which in my view deserves greater attention: the Protocol on the role of national parliaments. In the Protocol, national parliaments are called upon to actively uphold the principle of subsidiarity during the legislative process. I voted in favour of this report. Nevertheless, I wish to stress that, so far, very little has been done. Applying this Protocol would meet our citizens’ need, albeit only in part, for democratic legitimacy, and overcome that feeling of remoteness which surrounds the European institutions. I think that a need felt so keenly by our citizens deserves greater attention. I therefore hope that further measures are adopted as soon as possible. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only endorse the text of this report. Mr Meyer has rightly highlighted the need to create a European one-stop shop. The creation of such facilities remains the main goal yet to be achieved. However, the statistics in the report clearly show that there is a significant lack of information at European level, not only with regard to the public’s right of petition, but also in terms of the so-called informal mechanisms. For example, SOLVIT has shown that it works properly, swiftly and effectively, but this has not changed the fact that our fellow citizens only marginally avail themselves of this service. I wonder whether it would not be more appropriate to organise a media campaign at European level on these topics instead of merely improving the Parliament website, which is an important communication tool, but which does not reach every citizen at the moment. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around half of all CO2 
emission-intensive industrial projects in developing countries have some form of export credit agency support. These projects usually present a high environmental and social risk. Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the scale of this phenomenon, since the agencies themselves have no data or rules on transparency of information. This situation is completely at odds with our environmental policy. I wonder whether it would not be worth looking at the scale of this phenomenon in more depth. Mandatory risk calculations are a first step. However, even clearer rules are needed in order to direct these forms of financial support towards the carbon reduction target that we have set ourselves. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by Mr Bütikofer. The EU needs a strong industrial base on which to grow, and this cannot be achieved without an adequate supply of raw materials. Once again, we are being penalised because there is no common aim at international level. How can we dream of asserting our interests when dealing with countries such as China without a cohesive European Union? I am convinced that European raw materials diplomacy is the right solution to the supply crisis. I hope that the adopted proposals will be acted on and that the role of the European External Action Service will gradually be strengthened in the near future. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union specifies that the regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework shall be adopted by the Council after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Article 312(5) requires the three institutions to work together to find a solution ‘throughout the procedure leading to the adoption of the financial framework’, i.e. prior negotiation is required. As Mr Böge stated in his report, this negotiation has not taken place. The Council asked Parliament simply for approval, with no attempt to reach a common solution. Not even Parliament’s wish for greater flexibility has been addressed by the Council. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that Parliament cannot consent to this proposal for a draft Council regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. I hope that for all future proposals, this institution’s voice will be heard, as, moreover, required by Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The European Union, together with all the democratic institutions of the Member States, has an inescapable duty to guarantee public safety against a global phenomenon such as terrorism. This is a duty that often involves the difficult task of reconciling limitations on certain freedoms with guaranteeing safety. Most concerns arise from the civil aviation sector. Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report contributes to the discussion and joint consideration by the three institutions with a view to adopting new measures and moving forward on this task. I agree with the call to implement harmonised rules across the EU regulating operating conditions and common standards for the detection performance of scanners, which is why I fully support the work done by my colleague.

) Mr President, Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public law enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers’ interests. As we know, the regulation proposes to achieve its aims by establishing an EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws in the Member States. In the light of recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection, I agree on the need to update the legislation. By removing the irrelevant laws, we will ease consumer protection cooperation between the national enforcement authorities. I think the amendments set out in Mr Repo’s report will successfully translate our pre-established objectives into reality and improve legal certainty, so I therefore voted in favour.

Mr Wagner’s report clearly shows the importance of an integrated European energy network, in order to be able to guarantee security of supply and diversification of sources. I believe that in order to achieve these objectives, enshrined also in the recent Treaty of Lisbon, it is right to give priority to energy infrastructures, which the Commission also considers to be outdated and poorly interconnected. We must face this infrastructure deficit, and the measures contained in Mr Wagner’s report do precisely this. The difficulties and crises in bilateral relations between energy consumer countries and producer countries are further proof of the fact that we have to think to the future, to an energy policy for the European Union. Mr Wagner’s report is a first step in this direction, and therefore I have given him my support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the significance of this report, only 19 Member States reported on core indicators. This situation does not allow us to have a clear picture of the impact of cohesion policy on the ground. I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr Mikolášik, and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one, as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies. The organisation of public debates and consultations with stakeholders, together with the submission of reports to national parliaments for opinions are further positive measures in this sense. We have to make efforts to prevent a reduction in the funding made available for cohesion policy in the next programming period. For this reason, I supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights presented by the Commission has the merit of combining the four previous directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument. I agree with the report’s objectives. It is essential to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers in the 27 Member States and at the same time take into due account the need for manufacturers, regardless of their size, to provide their goods and services to European consumers without having to deal with unnecessary legal barriers. As things currently stand, the elimination of legal fragmentation is a difficult result to achieve. Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report also rightly expresses doubts as to whether full harmonisation could produce different effects to those expected. I therefore voted in favour, because I am convinced that it would be useful to make an amendment to the Commission’s proposal, achieving minimum harmonisation and at the same time guaranteeing a high-level service to consumers.

 My colleague Mr Casini’s report confronts and makes a positive contribution towards resolving the problems associated with interpreting and applying Rule 51 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I fully share Mr Casini’s view that it did not suffice to refer to a sole interpretation and to the guidelines intended to facilitate implementation. The conditions for the application of the procedure with joint meetings of committees and a joint vote – and I am referring in particular to the criteria of ‘competence and major importance’ of the matter in question – are clear and suited to eliminating the legal uncertainties that have existed up until now. I offer my congratulations for the good work accomplished, and I hope that this report is able to facilitate the work of Parliament by means of greater use of this procedure. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 We are currently witnessing radical changes in the international order; changes to which the European Union can no longer be a mere spectator. I think the European Union should see this as a starting point and take a truly active role in dealing with both current and emerging world powers, shaking off once and for all its reputation as a political dwarf in terms of international policy. In the same vein, I agree with the need expressed in Mr Lambsdorff’s proposal for the Member States to exert pressure during discussions to reform the United Nations Security Council in order to obtain a permanent seat for the European Union. By strengthening the role of the European Union at the United Nations, we will succeed in ensuring that the EU takes a leading role in regional and global affairs. Otherwise, we shall have to keep facing up to the continuous lack of coordination of Member States’ interests on the international scene. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Despite a series of hindrances – such as the economic crisis, the persistent inability to close the gap with the United States and increasing competition from emerging countries – the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has proved that it can offer added value to European research and development. FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Looking at Mr Audy’s report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium–sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility. With a view to negotiating the future financial perspective from 2014, these measures will pave the way for the Europeanisation of research. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The data in the report by Mrs Hirsch is alarming: the youth unemployment rate is now 21%, twice the average rate of unemployment at EU level. The motion contains useful ideas and should surely be seen in a positive light, yet I am convinced that we need to provide adequate financial resources in order to properly tackle the challenges posed by the Copenhagen Process and the EU 2020 strategy, for instance through the Structural Funds and, in particular, through the European Social Fund. With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States. Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market, I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’.

Mr President, the proposal for a regulation on which we are being called to vote undoubtedly has the merit of bringing together in a single text all the existing legislation relating to textile products. This regulation will make it possible to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework on the development and use of new fibres, as well as supporting the development of innovative products and encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector. I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list. While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation.

Mr President, making it easy for citizens to scrutinise how decisions are made, together with the processes, elements and resources that influenced them, helps both to ensure greater transparency and to close the gap between the European institutions and citizens, which is often discussed in relation to legitimacy and to the so-called democratic deficit in the European Union. Great progress has been made in the last few years. One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission’s 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a ‘one-stop shop’ register for lobbyists. The approval of the Stubb-Friedrich report by this House led to the creation of a joint working group. We can safely say that the results achieved by that group with regard to the objectives set by Parliament are more than satisfactory. I fully agree with Mr Casini’s report, as the transparency of political institutions is a fundamental condition of their legitimacy. This is why I have supported the proposal.

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon lists foreign direct investment among the matters pertaining to common commercial policy. Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has exclusive competence in this matter. Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have maintained a significant number of agreements with third countries on foreign direct investment. If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter. The adoption of measures to substitute the existing agreements is the only way to ensure a high degree of protection for investors and to ensure that their rights are recognised and guaranteed by the legal certainty of such agreements. The draft certainly moves along these lines and I have therefore voted in its favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The Internal Market is without doubt the most important instrument that the European Union has to foster growth in the wake in the recent financial crisis. The millions of citizens and businesses that reap the benefits of the Internal Market must be able to exercise their rights and be able to travel, work and live freely anywhere in Europe. This is why they must also have access to effective remedies if they intend to make a claim against another citizen or business that endangers these rights. Today, the European Union has instruments in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts. However, the actual right to have judgments enforced is still lacking. Establishing an effective system for the freezing and disclosure of debtors’ assets, and stepping up cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States, are the best ways of filling these gaps. That is why I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy’s report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

According to Article 325(5), the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council an annual report on measures taken for the implementation of this Article. I agree that we need to quantify in greater detail the recovery levels of funds unduly paid to the EU Member States by gathering specific data. Another important point, rightly highlighted by Mrs Ivan in her report, is the use of better investigative methods regarding fraud carried out by Member States. In this way, we can standardise counter measures throughout the European Union and determine whether similar types of fraud have been committed in other countries. This is why I have supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Single Market is a valuable tool for economic recovery in the European Union, particularly for the creation of new jobs. The reports regarding the Act for the Single Market are, generally speaking, contributions made by the European Parliament in the consultation process begun by the Commission with its announcement ‘Towards a Single Market Act. Fifty Proposals for improving our work, enterprises and dealings together for a highly competitive social market economy’. I think we should have put more emphasis on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, and the stimulation of innovation and competitiveness by the lifting of bureaucratic, administrative and regulatory burdens. However, I agree with the general structure of the report and, in particular, with the measures mentioned which aim to strengthen e-commerce and the simplification of the procurement system.

 The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna was struck by a series of devastating earthquakes. Italy then applied for mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The EUSF was set up precisely to provide help for European citizens affected by natural disasters. I therefore voted in favour of this report to ensure that the fund would serve the purpose for which it was created. This will allow Emilia-Romagna to recover both economically and socially. The region is in real need of external assistance and I am sure that any assistance that is released will be well spent. Within a few weeks, EUR 670 million will be released in assistance to the region, and the money will be used to finance rebuilding of the electricity network and infrastructure. This is certainly an important step towards relaunching the local economy, which in turn has always played a crucial role in Italian industry.

 I voted in favour of Ms Tzavela’s report and reject the call for a moratorium. I think we should recognise the potential effects of developing the use of shale oil and gas in the European Union. Energy resources constitute a source of wealth that must be utilised and are also key for making Europe a major power in the energy field and strengthening its independence. The Member States need additional sources of energy in order to free themselves from dependence on foreign energy supply. It is therefore essential to study a variety of energy sources, including shale gas. Although this is not the only solution to our energy needs, it would bring considerable benefits. The experience of the United States could be taken as a model: there shale gas has had a notable impact, causing gas prices to fall to levels much lower than in Europe. However I believe that a cautious approach should be taken since extraction of shale gas involves possible environmental risks. We must have a clear vision of the situation, weighing up the factors for and against, and above all ensuring adequate controls. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I think that the two Commissioners here should be able to answer all of our questions on the policies they are pursuing and the choices they are making. In this context, I would like to ask Commissioner Tajani whether the work he has done up to now might, as a first stage, finish up with the Commission’s role being strengthened at European level as regards industrial policy, because this is something we would really like to see.

Of course I believe that it would be worthwhile in the current situation to revitalise the Competitiveness Council, and secondly I think that a working group should be set up within the Commission to work with Commissioner Almunia on the one hand and the Commissioner for trade on the other. While the problem with Europe’s industry is definitely a problem with Europe’s industry, at the same time it is also a problem with the rules of the internal market and with policy on external relations not being sufficiently vigilant so that all kinds of goods arrive in Europe that do not comply with our rules.

 The purpose of the proposed legislation concerning the marketing and use of explosives precursors is to restrict access by members of the public to fifteen substances in high concentrations, which are dangerous because they can be used to make homemade explosives. I therefore voted in favour of Mr Mulder’s report, because I believe it could help to prevent potential terrorist attacks and consequently is a very important step to guarantee citizens’ safety. I think it is important, in the case of some categories of substance, for public access to be authorised by setting up a licence system harmonised at European level, and for other categories I think this access needs to be accompanied by reporting and traceability of suspicious transactions.

 The consequences of the current economic and financial crisis will drag on for a long time yet, having a negative effect on the European economy, the employment rate, public savings and social investments in Europe.

I support this report, which I see as a very important step forward.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have had a good debate today in Parliament on the issues of industry, growth and employment, which, as the Commissioner pointed out just now, began this morning with the plenary debate with Commissioners Tajani and Andor and has effectively continued, because we talked about energy for a long time, addressing the problems faced by the automotive industry. We will now continue with a question I submitted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which will be discussed here this evening. We were given assurances that in December we would have a solution to this problem, and I believe that everything we voted on yesterday at the start of the session reinforces the attention Europe is paying to this issue. There is no doubt that a host of industrial activities are linked to the European steel industry: on the one hand, upstream, the steel, iron, cast iron and iron alloy industry, and on the other, downstream, all of the industries that use these products, particularly the automotive, mechanical engineering, building, piping and metal goods sectors, as well as maritime and naval shipbuilding, domestic appliances, chemicals and other sectors. To maintain an active and competitive steel industry is vital for the future of Europe and its citizens. Even by early 2000, Europe had already lost its supremacy, beaten by China to the top spot. In recent years, the European Union has chosen to invest heavily in environmental issues – and that is a choice we approve of – but this has doubtless led to rising costs in this sector, together with an increase in commodity prices and rocketing energy costs – let us not forget that in Europe, electricity costs 100 % more than in the United States – and for some Member States, higher borrowing costs. In 2007, European steel production reached an all-time high, with 406 000 workers directly employed in the sector and in related activities. During the period 2007-2011, we saw a 10.6 % fall in employment, and today the industry employs 363 000 workers. These are rather discouraging figures, particularly for 2012. The most worrying figure is the sharp decline in production in sectors closely linked to steel; in other words, automotive and construction, which last year alone recorded a fall in production of 3.2 %. Non-European imports are steadily rising. The administrative burden that European manufacturers must bear is high and gives rise to additional costs that reduce our capacity for investment in innovation and research, at times even resulting in relocation. Perhaps we should ask ourselves if, alongside the new strategy for industrial policy that the Commission has recently adopted, there is a need for sector policies, which seek to intervene on a case-by-case basis to reverse damaging trends that Europe can no longer afford. We know that the Commission is working on an action plan for the steel industry: what stage is this at? Having welcomed the CARS 2020 Action Plan, we would also like to see an operational plan for the steel industry that can be implemented immediately. It is perhaps worth considering whether policies could be introduced that would fully enable our strategic companies to respond to global competition. To be innovative, we should imagine the re-industrialisation of Europe being accompanied by a set of policies that need our support, such as research and innovation, which is an essential tool. However, I would also like to mention the need for a review of competition policy, which was drawn up in the 1990s and perhaps does not take into account the need for Europe’s economy to deal with a global market and global competition. The completion of the internal market is essential in order to bring down the cost of energy and special attention must be given to trade agreements with third countries. To conclude, we should perhaps also ask ourselves whether it is worth reinstating a Council dedicated solely to industry, returning to the situation prior to 2002. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of us in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have submitted a question for oral answer to this Parliament, to be dealt with tomorrow afternoon. The motion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was approved unanimously, by 44 members out of the 44 who were present, and on this occasion it became clear that it would be beneficial to seek a resolution. I know that the Bureau has decided in the first instance not to accept our motion. Mr President, I would like to ask this Chamber and you if we could review this position, since we believe that Europe is currently going through extremely difficult times in many sectors, but particularly in steel and steelmaking, given that jobs in this sector fell by 10.6 % during 2011 and, indeed, there is talk of another reduction by 10.4 % this year. For this reason, I think it would be beneficial to everyone to send a signal to the Commission and to Europe if, after tomorrow’s debate, we could already think of passing a resolution in December.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been the compromise possible today to clarify the issue of energy efficiency, which, until now, has remained the Cinderella figure of the climate and energy package. I thank all those who worked to achieve this result which – I repeat – is the only compromise possible today. It is now up to the Member States to respond accordingly by taking action on public buildings and cutting red tape to raise public awareness. I am glad that the Commissioner reaffirmed the commitment to present the report by 2014, because that will allow us to assess the results already achieved and to propose any new guidelines, which are certainly necessary.

 We are facing an historic moment in which migration flows are mixed and we have to deal with asylum applications by land and by sea. I voted in favour of the report on enhanced solidarity in the field of asylum as it is a concrete commitment to guarantee suitable and effective asylum policies. The report outlines better harmonisation of protection and asylum standards and increased solidarity between Member States, which is to say, mutual assistance and responsibility sharing between Member States in order to ensure rights are promoted and respected. I agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur: practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity, and I also believe it is necessary to make use of the complementarity of EU funds.

 The new regulation on European standardisation is a satisfactory compromise reached after a year of tough negotiations. I believe that standardisation is a key step on the road to achieving the objectives outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy and to boosting the internal market. This regulation will help European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity within a constantly updated system, products will be safer, services faster and costs lower. All this is advantageous, particularly for previously under-represented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will now be better represented and which will now incur lower costs and fewer burdens in general. The regulation does include among its objectives the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and increased transparency, as well as consumer and environmental protection. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

In December 2010, Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 were adopted, calling for a review of EU rules governing pharmacovigilance, which applied in July 2012. While the new legislation did strengthen pharmacovigilance at EU level, there are some potential weaknesses in the system in the texts on this issue that still need to be addressed. I voted in favour of the report on pharmacovigilance as it ensures stronger surveillance on the use of medicines and refines the system with regard to disclosure and notification of information to stakeholders. The legal framework is thereby now strengthened, ensuring higher levels of transparency and safety. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The issue of growth, especially in this historic period where Europe is going through a period of economic and financial crisis, is amongst the priorities on Europe’s agenda. ‘Europe 2020’ includes measures aimed at achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. To achieve the objectives set out in this strategy and to help the market unleash its full potential, modern and efficient infrastructure (in the field of transport and energy) throughout Europe is of key importance. This is exactly why I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report. It focuses on project bonds which, in addition to equity instruments and grants, help to finance new projects and obtain more private investment. For 2010-2020, EUR 1.5 trillion will be needed to build infrastructure, whereas the figure allocated in the text is EUR 230 million. There is still a lot of work to be done, but in this situation, Mr Färm’s report is a step in the right direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Within the context of the process of European integration, the creation of a single railway area is of fundamental importance. One need only recall the fact that one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based is the free movement of persons throughout the territory of the EU. For this reason, I have wholeheartedly supported Ms Serracchiani’s recommendation. There are two aspects within it which I would like to emphasise. The first relates to the creation of a network of fully independent national regulators with greater powers, coordinated by the Commission, with the possibility, in the future, of establishing a single European regulator. The second concerns the change of duration of the contract between Member State and infrastructure manager from three to five years. This change will make it possible to have better medium- and long-term guarantees for investment plans. A single railway area will permit non-discriminatory access to the market and will make our railway network stronger, healthier and more competitive. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Roads are currently the main mode of transport within the European Union, for both passengers and freight. Freight transport by road accounts for more than two-thirds of the total tonnage. It is for that reason that I decided to vote for and support the report by Ms Ţicău, to amend the regulation on recording equipment in road transport. Tachographs have a concrete impact on the daily lives of drivers, and because of that it is vitally important to make them more efficient in order to improve road safety, drivers’ working conditions and to ensure fair competition among transport companies. Improving safety on Europe’s roads is a duty which the European Union cannot ignore. The establishment of statutory obligations for manufacturers of tachographs, authorities, transport operators and drivers, as contained in the report, does precisely this. These aspects, together with the introduction of the latest technologies, make the report an excellent point of departure for raising the level of safety on our roads. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The safety of EU citizens is one of the European Union’s main concerns. In addition to negative effects caused by failure to respect intellectual property rights having an impact on Europe’s economy, counterfeiting and piracy cost European businesses nearly EUR 250 billion annually, and damage and jeopardise the health and safety of the residents of the EU’s 27 states. I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann because it deals precisely and clearly with an extremely important issue, by seeking to simplify the regulatory framework that currently exists, so as to make measures to combat counterfeiting more effective and rigorous. Consumer protection, facilitation of the work of customs authorities, protection of intellectual property rights and combating fraud are the keystones on which European policy in this sector must rest. We will only be able to achieve protection of the health and defence of European citizens and the EU economy through vigorous and decisive protection of intellectual property rights, and this report is an important step towards attaining this goal.

 Road safety is a subject of enormous importance, especially nowadays, when technology and developments in the automotive sector are reaching ever higher levels. The EU’s task is to adopt legislation that will enable citizens to travel on safe roads and in safe vehicles. That is why I voted for the resolution moved by Mr Koch and Ms Sehnalová on the adoption of the eCall system in all cars by 2015. The introduction of this device will bring many benefits. In the event of a serious accident, a vehicle equipped with eCall will automatically place a 112 emergency call, even if the passenger is not in a fit state to speak, and provide the emergency services with all the key information on the accident. Thanks to the use of this technology, about 2 500 lives will be saved every year and the severity of injuries sustained will fall by 10-15%, all due to the swifter and more efficient intervention of the rescue services at the scene of the accident.

 This proposal for a regulation is intended to overhaul the provisions on foodstuffs for specific nutritional uses, contained in the Framework Directive on Dietetic Products, which makes substantial reference to the 1979 standard. The proposal intends to abolish the concept of dietetic foods and set out a new framework containing general provisions for a limited number of well-defined categories of foods judged essential for some particularly vulnerable sections of the population, for example foods aimed at infants and children and foods to be used under medical supervision. Vulnerable people need greater protection than the rest of the population and must be able to benefit from a high level of legal certainty. The proposal also suggests creating a single legal act that regulates the list of substances that can be added to the food categories that are the subject of this proposal. The differences in how Member States implement the existing legislation are currently too large, causing market distortions and administrative burdens. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The EU-Latin America partnership has always been very strong, both from a cultural and a commercial standpoint. Indeed, the Union is the principal donor of development aid and the principal investor in the area. I voted in favour of the report on development cooperation with Latin America since it clearly and accurately addresses topics important to future collaboration between the EU and Latin America. At this time of economic crisis, we must enhance current EU-Latin America relations. The food crisis, the fight against climate change and social problems are challenges common to both of these areas. A positive resolution of the above issues will largely depend on the cooperation relationship that will be established in the coming years. Multilateralism and enhanced cooperation are two paths that we must embark upon with determination. Cooperating and collaborating with Latin America, by sending targeted aid, tailored to the situation and to the specific needs of each State, does not mean simply aiming to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This cooperation will also help eradicate poverty and inequality and boost economic development of the area. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted for the report on cross-border voluntary activities, which was tabled on the eve of the closure of the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. I believe it fills the existing regulatory gap and marks a step forward in relation to the current situation. The report sets out much-needed objectives, such as removing barriers to volunteers and thus allowing them greater and easier movement, and increasing volunteers’ knowledge in areas such as cultural heritage, sport and health. Voluntary work, which accounts for 5% of Europe’s GDP, improves the quality of people’s lives, provides considerable added value and adds to the training of young people, who can then look forward to a better career. There are currently 100 million European citizens working in voluntary activities; this is a fundamental expression of active citizenship and an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth. Voluntary work does entail costs, however, even though it is not paid, and there is therefore a need for tax exemption. Mr Scurria’s report promotes high-quality volunteering within and across national borders, and puts forward important proposals, such as creating a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and introducing a European Skills Passport.

 The Internet is the primary information tool used by millions of people around the world every day. Its strategic significance means that the European Union should pay particular attention to it, and regulation and protection of the Internet from external attacks are subjects of extreme importance. All the countries of Europe, in conjunction with private businesses, need to make a coordinated effort to try to contain and neutralise any cyber attacks. I voted in favour of Mr Kalfin’s report because a large number of European citizens and businesses are at risk of cyber attacks every day. The report proposes effective solutions to the problem. One such solution would be to implement a global plan whereby the interaction of the governments, businesses and individuals involved would prevent cyber attacks from happening and render the Internet more secure and protected. Information security is key to European security. Europe cannot, and must not, forego the need to protect user data and intellectual property. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The subject of energy security is vitally important in the policies of the European Union. The EU spends over EUR 400 billion on energy imports every year, and so its dependence on third countries is self-evident. Coordinating the Member States; diversifying energy suppliers, routes and sources; extending Europe’s sphere of influence beyond its borders; sharing information on energy data and projects in third countries; and developing partnerships with suppliers and international organisations are the key points on which the new European energy policy should be based. If we put these guidelines into practice alongside everything the European Union is doing in terms of energy efficiency and developing new forms of energy, we will be in a position to achieve a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy. Much remains to be done before we have a proper common energy policy, but there is no doubt that Parliament intends to move firmly in that direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The global economic crisis remains a concern for the European institutions and EU citizens. The creation of a financial transaction tax (FTT) has some significant aspects for the EU’s budget. I voted for the report by Ms Podimata because it stresses once again the constant attention being paid by the European Union to the effects of the crisis. In addition, its implementation will make it possible to generate more fiscal revenue for the European Union’s budget: approximately EUR 57 billion (two thirds of the total revenue of the FTT). It should be emphasised that the FTT needs to be applied globally, not merely at European Union level; otherwise, there would be a risk that financial entities would migrate to markets outside the EU, thus weakening the European market.

The report by Ms Sarnez is very important and topical at this time of global economic crisis. I voted for the report by my fellow Member because it sets out effectively and precisely an overview of the most sensitive and significant issues in relations between the European Union and China. Aspects such as reciprocity, the protection of intellectual property rights, transparent rules, the resolution of the trade imbalance and the formulation of rules to create a system of competition that is fair, honest and founded on a level playing field are all issues of great importance for European industry as a whole. In view of the very important part now played by the Chinese market for our enterprises, this report is a clear signal to the European institutions, with the intention that these issues should be tackled as swiftly as possible so that European enterprises may enter the Chinese market and thus take advantage of the many investment possibilities it offers.

 This own-initiative report welcomes the work carried out in order to establish a European Union internal security strategy. By virtue of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is actually entitled to take the lead on this issue, setting priorities and defining the future internal security model. I consider the work carried out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and by Ms Borsellino, to be significant. The key areas of European intervention are highlighted here and the primary objective seems to be that of achieving greater cooperation among the Member States’ courts and police, in order to tackle the threats arising from organised crime, terrorism, corruption, cybercrime and also natural disasters. I fully agree with the intention to create a common European area of freedom, security and justice and to adopt a unified strategy for all Member States. I believe that there is a great need to step up efforts in order to improve the consistency of the information and data which is used to assess the risks borne by EU bodies and to guarantee transparency in the methods used, thereby achieving the basic purpose of ensuring full protection of citizens.

The report by Mr de Jong stresses that in order to guarantee coherent and high-quality European legislation on criminal law, the three institutions must reach an agreement on principles and working methods. I am in agreement with this own-initiative report due to the serious approach that was taken in regulating such a delicate policy area. In particular, I agree with the importance given to mutual recognition, harmonisation of protection standards and the principle of the presumption of innocence. I support the creation of a common European legal culture and of a uniform and coherent strategy as well as the promotion of greater institutional coordination, while ensuring that the main areas of criminal law remain the responsibility of the Member States. The law must be extremely clear and easy to understand, which is why I agree that the European Commission should appoint a specific coordinating authority. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I welcome the report by Ms Irigoyen Pérez, which aims to ensure equal treatment and the elimination of discrimination in the internal market and, in particular, protection of the most vulnerable consumers. This is to be achieved through a targeted strategy which consists of promoting programmes to support consumer information and education, uniform application of standards in all Member States and transparent pricing, especially with regard to e
-commerce. We also need stricter rules on advertising, which is misleading at times, and a greater control over the information given to the public in order to avoid buyers making ill-informed choices. Consumers need to be better protected when buying and they must be carefully looked after, by creating legislation on adequate, clear and precise information, which will help achieve a more transparent and competitive single market.

 Turkey is a candidate country for accession to the European Union, and is therefore bound to observe the Community acquis
 and to commit to respecting human rights, including the rights of women and gender equality, one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, these rights are not always respected in Turkey, a country where violence against women continues to occur day after day. I believe that there is a definite need for a change of course, a transformation of the patriarchal structure of Turkish society and culture. This report calls on the Turkish Government to take concerted and coordinated action to implement legislative measures on women’s rights, their education and participation in politics. Turkey does not do enough to protect women. There are still countless cases of forced or early marriages. Development of better education for all is essential when it comes to fundamental rights.

 The ITER project has a particular importance within the programme for a greener, more sustainable Europe, a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy.

The additional financing for 2012-2013 confirms Parliament’s desire to support a project that is very ambitious, much discussed, but also extremely important when it comes to striving for excellence in a sector in which the EU can take a leading role.

 Education is a fundamental aspect that must be taken into account in the process of growth, development and prosperity for the Europe of the future.

Highly skilled workers will be needed in 35% of all jobs by 2020. Actions such as widening access to higher education, the Erasmus Master’s Degree Mobility Scheme and loans for students who want to study for a Master’s degree abroad will help the national governments in this delicate process in the interest of future generations.

 The recent financial crisis has affected many EU Member States, some of which have been hit harder than others.

The above measures are crucially important in the present crisis. They will allow the implementation of important infrastructure projects of fundamental importance for Member State revenues and for maintaining jobs. In this way, the EU can guarantee its support to Member States that are in difficulty, ensure that its aid is not lost, and provide guarantees to Member States that are net contributors.

 The European Union and the United States are together in the front line of the fight against international terrorism. Close cooperation between these two political entities is a requirement for reducing any kind of threat to a minimum. The agreement reached in 2007 is an initial step towards the end goal and now the agreement signed in November 2011 introduces important new provisions, including more efficient exchanges of information and greater protection for passenger data. I voted in favour of the agreement because it will shore up the fight against various criminal activities, aid in the capture of those guilty of terrorist acts, strengthen the transatlantic partnership and ensure that passengers’ privacy and personal details are protected.

 I think we need to start simplifying and harmonising taxes across the various Member States. Having 27 different sets of rules carries a number of disadvantages: high costs and administrative burdens, social and economic distortions, risks of discrimination and, lastly, an increase in opportunities for tax evasion. That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, who see their sovereignty over tax issues being threatened, I have voted in favour of Ms Thyssen’s report on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. Indeed, I am very much convinced that all Member States need to comply with the same rules if the single market project is to be completed. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report on the taxation of energy products and electricity because I completely agree with its basic principles: aligning provisions on energy taxation with the environmental goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and reducing distortions in the internal market between EU Member States. Indeed, the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity needs to be as coherent as possible with the EU’s environmental goals. The political groups cannot reach an agreement on proportionality. I was especially supportive of Amendment 53, which aims to rid the proposal of the principle of proportionality, primarily for pragmatic reasons. We cannot allow further increases in diesel prices at a time when, for fiscal reasons due to austerity measures, the prices of energy products are under constant pressure. Furthermore, diesel is often used for work purposes and it is obvious that road haulage would suffer major negative effects as a result of regulated minimum rate increases. Lastly, the people of Europe would not be able to comprehend such a decision. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I support Mr Cabrnoch’s report on the coordination of social security systems because I believe that a revision, an update and a clarification of the social security conditions in the various EU Member States were absolutely necessary. These are historic times, in which cross-border mobility has become an increasingly significant phenomenon and we really need coordination in this field in order to ensure security for our citizens and their future, and, of course, legal certainty for those concerned.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Parliament’s approval, from now on, the concept of ‘righteous’, which has always been applied to those who saved Jews from the ‘final solution’, will be the heritage of all of humanity. There have been objections from those who do not recognise Soviet communism as totalitarianism and who refuse to compare the lager
 to the gulag
, from those who prefer to ignore the massacre of the Armenians so as not to prejudice relations with Turkey, from those who think that comparing the shoah
 with other horrors of the 20th century by an extended and generalised use of the word ‘righteous’ makes it banal, and finally from those who have criticised the exclusion or inclusion of this or that example of genocide or massacre. The European Parliament has overcome these and other objections and, from now on, men and women who were brave enough, and sometimes lost their lives, opposing the abuse of tyrants of any ideology or political leaning will be recognised as heroes of human dignity and heroes in the building of the moral identity of the European people.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of European foreign and security policy is especially crucial at this particular historic juncture, which is marked by an extraordinary wave of protest that has taken hold in the Mediterranean and is also spreading across the Middle East. In view of this serious crisis affecting the whole of the southern Mediterranean and now spreading into the Arabian Peninsula, the European Parliament must act as a sounding board for all these protests by ordinary people. They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes. This House wants to deal directly with the High Representative and Vice-President, Baroness Ashton, particularly because of our role in controlling the budgets of civilian and military missions under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP). The first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions, primarily the Council and the Commission, driven by the post-Lisbon approach to European politics. Another very important subject is the EU’s multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being. In this regard, I have to welcome the recent resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly granting the European Union observer status within the Security Council, thus acknowledging what the Treaty of Lisbon enshrines. We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible. The report rightly highlights the great wave of civil protest in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and also in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, and points out events, contexts and expectations for each of these countries, as well as other subjects of particular interest, such as our strong transatlantic alliance and our hugely important relations with Russia. Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during a hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a Member asked the High Representative/Vice-President a loaded question. He said that, when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States’ isolationist stance, particularly in relation to the European Union, he replied ‘There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe’. The Member then asked Baroness Ashton, ‘Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now?’ Her very British answer was: ‘Yes, I do that job, although I am called High Representative/Vice-President and not foreign minister. There is also a phone number, but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position, 2 for the French, 3 for the German, and so on’. Baroness Ashton, you have heard the speeches by many of my fellow Members, and this message is also in my report. You have a number of voices in the world, but you listen to ours – Parliament’s – more because we always support a European policy, and not just that of the Member States, to which you reply in the Council, or that of the Commission, to which you reply in the appropriate places. I would like there to be a third place in which you could express your third loyalty. This place is in the middle of this Chamber, behind the podium, because you are the Council, the Commission and also Parliament. I believe this dialogue needs to be developed and strengthened in order to achieve democratic legitimacy for our external policy, directed and controlled by Europe’s citizens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years after the start of negotiations between the European Commission and Pakistan, an agreement has finally been reached on a readmission procedure for persons residing in the European Union without authorisation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs asked permission to draft an opinion on this very important agreement, particularly bearing in mind developments in the region around Pakistan and the issue of human rights. We had a lengthy debate in committee and several concerns were raised: the unstable situation and continual violations of human rights in Pakistan, as well as the fact that negotiations held with Pakistan did not guarantee the rights and safety of persons sent back to Pakistan. Also, we were worried that no evaluation of the 11 readmission agreements already in force has yet been made. In the end, the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs concluded that a clear framework for cooperation on readmission with Pakistan was preferable to a situation where there is a risk that Member States proceed to expel illegal immigrants from Pakistan on an ad hoc basis and without supervision based on the respect for human rights. Article 16 will ensure that the EU can carry out this supervision, so I reiterate the request of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for an evaluation of the agreements concluded thus far and I support its adoption.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: ‘No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The prohibition applies in all situations and is an overriding rule of international law and, as such, applies to all states. Not only does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights impose this protection of human rights against torture but so do the United Nations Convention and the European Convention. The European Union and its Member States take these obligations very seriously. Considering also that we celebrated the International Day against Torture last week, we believe that combating torture constitutes an absolute priority for the European Union. To respect these extremely important legal and moral obligations, we therefore need to impose a close control on the trade in equipment designed to inflict torture or other inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. The moment when the regulation was adopted represented a great step forward, as was also confirmed by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on torture. This regulation also serves as a model in terms of international legislation on the subject. The application of this regulation has not, unfortunately, been as exemplary as its adoption: only seven Member States have submitted one or more of the annual public reports laid down in Article 13 of the regulation, containing detailed information on authorisations granted for the import and export of goods that could be used for torture. These reports constitute an essential element for assessing full compliance with the regulation. Numerous questions are raised over the final use and destination of the goods when we analyse the authorisations granted. Authorities with responsibility for authorising exports must therefore carry out a more detailed political assessment before proceeding. Neither have many Member States communicated information relating to penalties applicable for infringing the provisions of the Council Regulation, as required in Article 17 of the regulation. Nearly five years after the adoption of the regulation, the list of goods identified in the Annexes to the regulation must be updated. Man can be very cruel and sometimes it seems that the human imagination for ways of inflicting suffering on others is unlimited. It is therefore of fundamental importance to keep pace with technological developments in this cheerless arena. For all these reasons, the time has come to table the question to the European Parliament and to call on the European Union and its Member States to show that they are able to keep their promises. As members of the European Parliament, it is our duty, by democratic mandate, to ensure that the institutions work responsibly. This is the reason why we want detailed information on what has been done so far to comply fully with the regulation and also on measures that will enable the situation to be improved in the future. We welcome, as a first step, the decision of the Committee supervising the application of this regulation at the end of this month. Lest we forget, Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 is not merely fine words but a fundamental and essential instrument that must now be applied in full. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union needs to adopt a new approach and make a joint effort when facing global challenges. The powers recently obtained due to the entry into force of the treaty mean that Parliament engages in frequent, cooperative and effective discussions with our primary interlocutor, Baroness Ashton, who has the honour of acting as the new Vice-President/High Representative for the first time. Her mandate was subject to our consensus vote in January and, on several occasions, the Parliamentary Assembly was promised that the Council and the Commission would be constantly involved in all the most important aspects of European security and defence. As the report itself confirms, the High Representative is therefore called upon to appear before the European Parliament and to consult it frequently and regularly. With the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union’s external action takes on a new and important dimension, but actually achieving this goal also depends on the European Union having the necessary budgetary resources. The European Parliament has a key role to play in its capacity as custodian of the democratic legitimacy of external action. The creation of a European External Action Service will give a diplomatic body and system to the European Union which, until now, has only been able to rely on national representation. The roles of the official representatives, whose appointment is the responsibility of the High Representative, assume great relevance and topicality. Nonetheless, as stated in the report, Parliament is calling for greater powers of ballot and control over the roles and the mandates of individual representatives, upholding the principles of transparency and merit that must guide the High Representative when appointing candidates. It is hoped that we will eventually achieve a situation of double hatting – except in the case of the special representative, whose range of action should be regional – and that we will therefore benefit from economies of scale, making the European Union’s external action more efficient and, at the same time, less costly. After an initial introductory section on strategy, the report addresses the issue of European foreign policy by theme and geographical area. The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied, especially the United Nations, the chief custodian of global security. It must play an important role, not only from the viewpoint of its seat on the Security Council, but also in terms of staff and delegations connecting the two bodies. We call on the Vice-President/High Representative to let Europe fulfil its ambition to become an active, strategic and independent partner of a great ally such as the United States in order to respond to the global challenges of terrorism, finance, and the often fraught relationships with industrial giants such as Russia, China and Japan. The report continues with a geographical analysis of what we can hope to achieve. In the Balkans, the theme of enlargement is introduced: the report praises the gradual achievement of the stabilisation process in Kosovo, where the European Union is present with the EULEX mission, but efforts must still be made to ensure that accession standards are respected for many countries close to candidacy for accession – Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the chapter concerning cooperation with the East and the Black Sea regions, the report deals with the issue of the European Union’s energy supply security and dependency. In the section on Russia, it calls for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to be signed. As far as the South Caucasus is concerned, the report calls for the territory of Georgia and its ethnic minorities to be left intact, and for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria to be resolved Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the European Union must play a stronger political role in relaunching the peace process following the Council decision of 12 December 2009. Union for the Mediterranean: resolution of the Turkey-Cyprus conflict. Asia: Afghanistan, critical period for the establishment of a new government after the elections; Pakistan’s key role in the fight against terrorism; concern over the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. Africa: positive contribution of the Somali coast defence mission. Latin America: need to create a stable and enduring partnership for relationships between the European Union and Latin America. I will listen to my fellow Members’ comments with great interest and respond to them at the end. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

I thank my fellow Members, so many of whom have spoken, especially those who approved the key parts of the report, praising and endorsing its content, but also those who expressed criticisms and who, above all, did so in a desire to overcome the regrettably tragic instances where force has been used, and to dream of a peaceful world. A great Greek philosopher, Plato, said that only the dead will see an end to war. However, despite our refusal to bow to this philosophy and our attempts to prevent this happening, reality compels us to use force even on peace missions. I congratulate High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, and thank her for having mentioned my report: one aspect of her approach that I particularly like is its dual nature, the way it seeks synergy between the tasks of the Council and the Commission. Her very physical location – which will alternate between the benches of the Council, here, and the Commission – exemplifies her wish to wear two hats. As Parliament, I believe that we must support and promote this synergistic commitment. The European Commission pursues policies for development, neighbourhood, and for stability and the promotion of human rights and democracy; the Council undertakes peace missions and missions to implement the rule of law. This set of themes must find its ultimate expression in the European foreign diplomatic service, which must be efficient, effective, and equipped with the necessary skills and resources to be able to carry out its role as it should, and we will work hard to achieve this. I also thank the High Representative – and we will discuss this further on 23 April – for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of the external service, which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth. Today marks the beginning of our collaboration, but certainly not the end. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public opinion is divided on the Goldstone report. In particular, the Israeli armed forces are accused of having deliberately caused the deaths of countless civilians during the urban guerrilla operations. This is a very serious accusation, which appears to overlook certain undeniable facts, such as the distribution of leaflets throughout the battle zone to explain that houses containing weapons and munitions could be hit, and the telephone and radio warnings, including on Hamas frequencies, before attacks were launched on buildings identified as arms depots. The so-called ‘roof knocking’ technique was also used: if, after all those warnings, the air force still identified buildings full of people, small explosive and, above all, loud, charges would be launched to quickly evacuate the buildings. The Israeli army introduced warning signals for the Gaza civilians that no one else had put into practice before. Anyone who uses all these precautions cannot, under any circumstances, be accused of deliberately targeting civilians. Yesterday, on the same day, I met two major political figures: the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, in the morning, and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, in the evening. In both cases, the meeting was held in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and the hope expressed that, after too many decades of fighting, weapons will finally be abandoned in favour of a peace process. Just as both governments have also requested, Europe must maintain its balanced role as an impartial judge, sheltered from ideological positions that could only further inflame the feelings of both sides. Gabriele Albertini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Monday’s vote within the Committee on Foreign Affairs provided additional evidence of the complexity and, at the same time, of the benefit of extending the geographical and political borders of the Europe that we know today. Thanks to the work and efforts of my fellow rapporteurs and the contribution of individual political groups, we have achieved a text that expands on the original and has refined many aspects that were initially only mentioned in passing. The debate in committee and also within the groups themselves was not lacking in disagreements, sometimes lively, which are typical of an across-the-board confrontation that transcends the respective political positions. Historical events within each nation and the current state of their relations were at odds with applications made by candidate countries or aspiring candidates. In less than a year, another three applications were submitted to open membership negotiations: Montenegro in December 2008, Albania in April 2009 and Iceland in July 2009. It is a sign that the European project can still boast plenty of appeal and is considered a major factor of stability, particularly following the meltdown in financial markets. The text obtained as a result of the votes within the Committee on Foreign Affairs more forcefully underlines the need for the countries who wish to join the European Union to face up to this transition conscientiously, aware of the duties and implications that this process involves. Their entry requires them to respect European parameters, not only economic and political, but also cultural, social and legal, to ensure that the end result is more than the sum of its parts. I hope that the text that the plenary session will vote on tomorrow will address all aspects of the general strategy on enlargement in a more balanced and concise way. It will obviously benefit from the contribution of specific resolutions on each country. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE
),

The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us. I am grateful to Mr Brok and to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the excellent work they have done in spite of the little time available. On the basis of this work, the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service. The message that we want to send out to the Commission and the Council is basically this: we want a service that has extensive powers and which fulfils our ambitions of making the European Union a global political player, and we want this to happen on a consensual basis, that is to say, with the involvement and the support of all three institutions – Parliament, the Commission and the Council. I therefore urge the Commission to be courageous in the negotiations and to defend the Community model, and I invite the Council once again to involve this Parliament and, in particular, the committee that I chair, in the negotiations from the outset, in order to complete this crucial stage in the creation of a true European foreign policy. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Piebalgs. His statements just now confirm that South Stream is not Nabucco’s competitor but a further contribution to the diversification of Europe’s energy supply sources. Europe’s energy security is based on a variety of sources, routes and supply countries. At zero growth, future demand for gas is estimated at an additional 100 to 150 billion m3 
by 2020. Based on these assumptions the development of different options is imperative, and South Stream is not an alternative to Nabucco, but in fact complements it. The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco, South Stream and the Turkey-Greece-Italy interconnection (ITG). The anti-Russia debate is therefore in conflict with what we will see happening over the next few years. The European Parliament must call for pragmatism and above all consistency in the decisions that the European Union has essentially already taken: with the European economic recovery plan, with Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks, and with the second energy security strategy. The diversification of sources, routes and supply countries is the real pillar of Europe’s energy security policy and, leaving aside the political and economic interests of the various countries most directly involved, the South Stream-Nabucco challenge must be analysed with realism, not through the distorting prism of ideology but rather with a clear vision of what needs to be done.

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, have to say that I had got a somewhat different impression of the conclusions of the summit from reading the newspapers from my own and other countries yesterday and the day before. This morning you, Mr Van Rompuy – and you more than Mr Barroso, in fact – have dashed those hopes and have cast doubt on a solution that had been touted in the papers and all the statements as a turning point, a new approach and a chance for Europe to rebuild and restore real confidence. I agree with Mr Barroso that it is a very important basic principle to make it clear in the various statements and in the final document that monetary stability in a modern economy can only lead to financial stability. Someone called it an historic statement; I see it as a basic premise to start from. If the state bailout fund gives the virtuous countries that have access to the fund the chance to recapitalise, then there is a real prospect, a real possibility. The term ‘possible’ dominates the final document; of course I join those who are laying a huge responsibility on your shoulders right now. In your reply, you must explain effectively and decisively whether the Member States can really put plans into action and be confident that it is not merely a general, abstract reversal of a trend that is not going well and is not enough for the markets. Everyone is said to be making do because we need to reach the end of the tunnel. I believe we are a very long way from the end of the tunnel and so, as regards putting plans into action, we had imagined that all the uncertainty of the previous year in Europe might be swept away by a real, effective decision to be reached at the Brussels Summit. Should we feel disappointed on this point? Should we wonder why it has not come true? Please tell us, Mr Van Rompuy, so we can avoid all these misunderstandings. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Swoboda for his solidarity with regard to the recent tragedies in Italy and especially for the significance he attached to the problems we are dealing with: civil harmony and the possibility that, through solidarity and the possibility of development, we can build a different Europe and a different civil society. It is clear to all of us that the debate conducted by Parliament in recent months on the intergovernmental agreement known as the fiscal compact has vindicated all political groups: I believe that the concerns we expressed have all come true. I am also sorry that the minister denies that there is a gap between austerity and development because I think that this dichotomy has hitherto paralysed our debate, as well as Europe’s development. The one-way monetary policy is not a development policy, just as a balanced budget is a bureaucratic, systematic element, but not forward-looking. The clash between austerity and development is not suited to the complexity and the needs of Europe – something we are all becoming aware of – because we are finding it difficult to move forward, which is perhaps the result of this deficiency and cultural poverty which always leads to an economic freeze. At the forthcoming summit, we must therefore develop a different policy, creating a political Europe as well as a fiscal Europe. While the Commissioner has stated he is ready for action, Parliament can only take him at his word. This is an important statement because to date, we have had to create the conditions, at least I interpret it that way, positively, even though others have taken different positions. However, we need finally to agree on a plan, a strategy able to create a political Europe, which is vital for a Europe of development. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at a time of crisis in Europe – because the debate in this House by all the groups regarding the agreement of 1 March has shown that the Community is in crisis – it is very significant that a country such as Serbia should be given the status of candidate for EU membership. I believe that it is a key moment, and I agree with the representatives of the Commission and of the Council, and with the rapporteur, that Serbia has taken many steps forward but must continue to solve problems and find uniformity with Europe. I believe this is a time of stability and a time of security for Europe and that the new relationship that Serbia is beginning to establish with Kosovo gives great hope not only to Italy, because its borders are closer, more adjacent, but also to all of Europe, which I believe has an interest in peace as a whole being guaranteed. I believe that we need to monitor behaviour, but I think all of us should be pleased about this rapprochement

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that today we have heard three speeches that bode well for Europe. They represent three programmes and three strategies. I would like to say to Ms Thorning-Schmidt that she has made a very important point, that Denmark follows Europe’s destiny. It is not just a throw-away line, it is a phrase that makes a commitment to strengthen Europe and to offer total support; to make sure, as she said at the end, that the Community method prevails. We therefore find ourselves in a very difficult situation – and mine is not empty rhetoric – as we are facing a halt in the EU development process. This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States. We have come to a standstill and are facing very difficult times, which I do not believe will lead to the possibility of development. With the intergovernmental agreement there is neither growth nor development. Therefore the commitment of the Danish Presidency is to prevent all this from happening. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel I need to express how I feel, which is both dismayed and concerned. I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose. We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other. There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament. Therefore I believe that we must do justice to this and take into account the fact that, as has been said, the Commission must guarantee the Treaties. The Commission therefore …  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I followed this morning’s debate and I have to say to the Polish President that what emerged showed far greater consensus than dissent. I personally belong to the group of people who expressed consensus and I would like to underline a very important part of the Polish President’s speech which yesterday provoked very lively discussion: You said, with regret, that the intergovernmental approach tends to take precedence over the European Community approach. The European Community has not seen the kind of development that we imagined for some years now, and the intergovernmental approach – as President Barroso clearly explained yesterday – paralyses the momentum which EU law would otherwise have achieved over the past few years. The prevalence of EU law is at odds with an intergovernmental approach which fails to give rise to that hope, that potential in Europe, which you, as President for the past six months, have helped to create. Taking everything into account, we do not think the summit had either negative or positive conclusions, but left us with questions which will find answers in March. I think your Presidency has somehow prevented the fall of Europe, and we hope things will continue to develop in that vein in the year ahead. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by Mr Casini, but in the committee meeting, I tabled various amendments in the – very modest, but I believe very correct – belief that they improved the text. Those amendments were not accepted because there was a discussion, which was also held at a high level, with you in attendance, and hence an agreement had already essentially been reached. I am tabling two oral amendments, one of which I consider to be very important because, as the Article states … I would like all the Members to listen to me for a moment, because I believe there is a problem … Two minutes … Do I have to speak later? May I continue?  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer both to this amendment and to the next one, because I have tabled two oral amendments. I believe that this one is very timely and integral to the overall text, because the Article spells out the duties of MEPs in the text, in the introduction, but it is very muddled and actually stipulates what cannot be done, not what MEPs must do in accordance with what Mr Casini said about our transparency and our representation of the people, whom we must represent in a correct and very scrupulous manner. I believe that it is very muddled. I would place even more emphasis on the other amendment, Mr President. Since we are stipulating that MEPs must not accept gifts worth more than EUR 150, my amendment, ladies and gentlemen, was far stricter in proposing a much lower amount, because I believe that MEPs should not accept any gifts or courtesies save for those of little, or negligible, value. I believe that the proof of this is in a letter received by all the MEPs. This letter provides for, offers MEPs EUR 100 to take part in a survey. I believe that this is an offence against …

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like us to recall what the European Union budget really is. The budget is not additional to national budgets, and to believe so would be to continue to conduct this debate on false premises, with the risk of fragmenting our efforts. The EU budget is synthetic and has the aim of multiplying the effects of the investments made by the individual Member States. It therefore creates more efficiency and effectiveness. Resources that are removed from the EU budget raise national public expenditure: this is the underlying principle on which he have built the Union. If the EU is seen as an additional entity to the Member States, just as the EU embassy in non-EU countries is additional to all of the national embassies, then we are misleading ourselves. Therefore to believe that by saving in the EU budget, we are contributing to general saving and austerity is an unpardonable error. Instead, what we manage to achieve with the EU budget is to allow individual states to make savings, to lower expenditure and encourage austerity. If we cannot acknowledge this fact – due to the sort of ‘soft’ nationalism every state has to show to its own public opinion – the result will be that we are constantly reducing the EU budget, which will always result in increases in the national budgets. In the end the individual Member States will spend the EUR 140 billion in any case, but with diminished efficiency, because the studies carried out by the Commission already show us that each euro yields 95 cents in the EU budget but only 50 cents in the national budgets.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I believe that things are a bit better, the impression after this Council is that a sort of ‘Penelope’s shroud’ principle is being applied and we are being asked to return again to matters that we thought had been concluded. I would therefore ask in regard to the single supervisory mechanism, which is certainly a good compromise, what the Commission intends to do to put pressure on the Member States pushing for its entry into force to be postponed. What is going to be done to ensure that they adopt more reasonable positions? As many wise leaders have observed, time is money. We must acknowledge that some countries want more time, but not enough attention is being paid to the fact that we seem to be postponing indefinitely the adoption, and the final implementation, of any decision. In other words, I believe that the results achieved by the Council should be viewed positively, but I also believe that all possible efforts should be made to ensure that these results take immediate effect.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good opportunity to have an objective discussion on Kazakhstan and the important agreement the country is negotiating with the EU. Kazakhstan is crucial for the stability and strategic future of Central Asia and is without doubt an important economic and trading partner for the EU. The country has already launched a process of economic and democratic reform, although much remains to be achieved in these areas. However, the country has shown itself to be committed to further and more far-reaching reforms and I think that the duty of the EU is to support this process. To this end, I am certain that the signing of this enhanced agreement will allow progress to be made, because it will strengthen an already solid and productive relationship and ensure constant assistance from the EU. I am also convinced – and I think that this should have been underlined more clearly in the report to be voted tomorrow – that greater progress in the areas of democracy and human rights should be met by renewed reciprocal efforts that are both open and constructive. Our aim should not be to place ourselves on a negative footing with this or that country if change is not achieved immediately, but rather to support the efforts by these countries to attain the objective of respect for the principle of human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation for the adoption of this report that, once again, draws the attention of the European Union to the protection of health and to the protection of citizens. With this report, we have, in fact, re-addressed the issue of surveillance of medicinal products, following the adoption of Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 amending the directives on pharmacovigilance. Since the so-called Mediator case, indeed, there has been a need to address the shortcomings identified by the tests conducted in this regard, and to refine the existing system, especially with regard to information requirements and notification of stakeholders and to the list of medicinal products subject to strengthened pharmacovigilance. The amendments introduced, although modest in their scope, complement and reinforce the legal framework outlined previously in favour of greater transparency and efficiency and improved product safety standards, thus benefiting the health of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Seeber’s report is Parliament’s contribution to the preparation of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, in which the Commission will be taking stock of what has been achieved since the Water Framework Directive, which has been one of the main pillars of European water policy since 2000. We voted for this report, which casts light on the challenges to be faced and the gaps to be filled, particularly in relation to the target of sustainability in terms of ecological, chemical and quantitative ‘good status’, which the framework directive says must be achieved by 2015. Among the measures suggested are the mainstreaming of water issues in all EU policy areas; the development of a holistic approach that examines all water uses and their implications; promotion and support for efficiency and sustainability in the management of this basic asset; and the achievement of water supply security, not only regionally but also internationally.

 The proposal for a regulation in question, updating Directive 2009/39/EC in line with legal and market developments, has raised questions over the classification of many products as ‘dietetic’, establishing general provisions for only a limited number of food categories considered essential for certain vulnerable population groups – foods aimed at infants, children and patients under medical supervision. At the same time it has shifted protection for other groups (coeliacs and people who are lactose-intolerant) to other EU legislation and mechanisms. The positive vote on Ms Ries’s report – the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – is a clear sign and a positive starting point for the coming negotiations. On one hand, it expresses the shared wish to simplify the regulations; on the other it draws attention to the need to reintroduce in the future regulation complete protection for the specific nutritional needs of all the most vulnerable groups of consumers.

 The violent flooding which hit Liguria and Tuscany in October 2011 severely damaged infrastructure, transport networks, businesses, agriculture and residential homes. Faced with this disaster, Italy requested mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, established in 2002 precisely to provide assistance to disaster-stricken regions. Our vote in favour of Mr Fernandes’s report will enable the fund to be mobilised – for the first time this year – for a total amount of EUR 18 061 682 for the Italian regions concerned. The importance of all this will be two-fold: as practical assistance with physical reconstruction, and as a symbolic gesture that will remind all Europeans of the value of solidarity, one of the cornerstones on which the European Union is founded.

 Mr President, Ms Irigoyen Pérez’s report, which we have voted to support, concerns the need to consider developing a strategy to protect the rights of the most vulnerable consumers, in light of the strategy that the European Commission and the Member States will be required to devise to that end. Consumers may be vulnerable for various reasons, and potentially anyone may be affected. That is why this group of consumers, along with consumers in general, needs to be protected. A targeted strategy is required that considers the problem in the round while, on the one hand, avoiding creating new forms of discrimination and, on the other, eschewing static, rigid definitions that are unable to embrace all the facets of the matter and the various possible kinds of vulnerability. Specific, targeted protective measures are therefore needed. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Søvndal for his thorough description. First of all, I, too, would like to express our total support to the families of the victims of the serious clashes that took place on 16 December in Zhanaozen, and our concern for the subsequent unfolding of events. What was initially essentially a labour dispute degenerated into extremely serious incidents in which 17 people lost their lives and, in the days following the incident, led to the arrest of journalists and representatives of the opposition. It is in everyone’s interest, as Kazakhstan has done, to shed full light on the events and I therefore hope that today will be remembered solely as an opportunity for our Parliament to explore what has happened thus far, and to reiterate our call for an investigation that will reassure the international community that the responsibilities for the events of Zhanaozen will be clarified and those responsible pursued in the utmost respect of the principles of the law and respect for human rights. The delegation that I have the honour of heading has had the opportunity of hearing the explanations provided by the Kazakh authorities at some of its meetings, as well as those of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are very active in monitoring events in the country. The willingness of the authorities of Kazakhstan to provide explanations and the promise to provide further clarifications are undoubtedly positive elements and should be appreciated by us all. This is another reason why I would like to underline the need to maintain a certain balance, which I would have liked to have seen play a bigger part also in the text of the resolution on which we will have to vote tomorrow, and which, in my opinion, it would perhaps have been better to have postponed until the official investigations were over. It would also have been useful to send an official mission of international bodies to flank the investigations. The undeniable need to further clarify what happened and to call for greater efforts on the part of Kazakhstan in improving its progress along the road to democracy must also be accompanied at all times by a new commitment to an open and constructive dialogue with the country.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at such a difficult time for Europe and after the blocking of the proposal at the Council and the tabling of a new amended Commission proposal, the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union is undoubtedly a positive act. It is a useful compromise that has resolved many of the issues that caused the impasse
, such as the full financing of the scheme by the European Union, with the participation of the Union in the distribution point programme, an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million for the Union’s financial contribution, the notion of the Union origin of the foods that are then distributed and the requirement for the purchase of food products to be made on the basis of competitive procedures. The scheme will therefore be operational from 2013 and will allow the supply of food products from reserves deriving from intervention in order to benefit the most deprived persons in the Union, thus also achieving one of the most important objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Today’s vote in favour is the culmination of this report’s complex and difficult path, and is an important sign of the Union’s support for its most deprived citizens. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the increase in intellectual property infringements observed in recent years threatens to undermine the strategy on intellectual property rights in the single market that was launched by the Commission in May 2011. To combat such infringements and ensure the success of the intellectual property protection policy, it has been proposed that the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market be entrusted with certain tasks relating to the running of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, set up in 2009. The purpose of this is to provide the Observatory with the human and financial resources to combat intellectual property infringements and to conduct campaigns to raise public awareness of the risks of buying counterfeit products. Our adoption of the report therefore marks a very important moment in the fight against the trade in counterfeit goods and in defence of innovation, growth and the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the jobs and security of the people of Europe.

 Four years after it was first introduced, the European Parliament is examining the status of implementation of the EU strategy for Central Asia. In the light of major developments in Europe and the world, the EU has summed up its achievements in its relations with this part of the world. This report underlines the need for a new approach focusing on strengthening long-term cooperation and a mutual strategic commitment in order to deepen the political, social and economic relations. The text also highlights the need to maintain a high level of commitment in all areas of society, thanks also to more financial resources, funding and programmes. Furthermore, the report draws attention to the institutional value of the partnership and cooperation agreements (PCAs) as the basis for exchanges with these countries and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committees as tools that can guarantee a regular platform for strengthening bilateral relations with countries in Central Asia. To sum up, the new strategy has a fundamental role in the creation of increasingly stable cooperation with this sensitive region, with which dialogue and the mutual exchange of knowledge will guarantee ambitious results in terms of economic cooperation, the promotion of development and defence of human, social and cultural rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenges posed by the modern age and by Mr Triantaphyllides’s report, for which we have voted in favour, dictate that citizens in their capacity as consumers should be placed at the centre of the EU debate, and they remind us that the safeguarding of citizens’ interests cannot remain a principle sanctified at the level of treaties, but should be a concrete and inspiring principle of EU politics. Protected and informed consumers, who are made more aware and are therefore in a position to take full advantage of the instruments and resources at their disposal, as well as to make full use of their rights, should be the final aim of the EU’s new strategy on consumer policy. This strategy should therefore be established as an approach with ample breathing space, and it should be all-encompassing, so that it can move freely from the sector of financial services to that of food, from the safeguarding of minors to advertising, and, therefore, be in a position to make an important contribution to Europe’s social and environmental objectives.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme, for which we voted in favour, is based on a measured, realistic approach which, on the one hand, has refrained from laying down impractical requirements that are impossible to meet, and on the other, has provided for a so-called flexibility scheme. By laying down stages and corresponding quantitative limits of permitted emissions, this scheme provides for the placing on the market of a pre-established annual quota of tractors meeting certain characteristics, and thereby enables the manufacturing and industrial sectors concerned to adapt to the pre-established standards gradually, without causing them disruption. Mr Tatarella has produced an important piece of work and has managed to strike a careful balance between the requirements arising from the major challenges which the EU needs to tackle at this time, and the requirements relating to environmental protection and the present economic crisis.

 Mr President, in recent years, the current global economic crisis, which is even worse than the Great Depression, has caused unsustainable imbalances in international economies. The commercial disparities between countries, financial markets lacking common rules, and the instability of the banking system all constitute a potential threat to financial and economic stability. This resolution, which I support, stresses the urgent need for total reform, with new rules and global economic coordination. The economy needs a system of global governance, open markets, high economic and social standards, a more responsible monetary policy and more stringent supervisory policies; decision-making bodies and international economic bodies must be the main stakeholders driving this new approach. In particular, Europe needs a clear and transparent framework to reduce the instability that has been aggravated by, among other things, globalisation, and to guarantee wide-ranging reforms aimed at fostering growth and reducing the debt of individual Member States. This is the demand that the current resolution highlights to all the countries. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent years, we have seen an increase in the number and intensity of natural disasters, which have become increasingly global in scale, with disastrous consequences. A genuinely European response to such disasters that involves, and is binding on, all the various levels of government in which the European Union is structured is crucial to address this scenario. Ms Gardini’s valuable report, which I voted for, highlights the importance of a simplified and rationalised Civil Protection Mechanism that is more extensively and effectively coordinated at a political and operational level and is not encumbered by red tape. It must allow for the pooling of resources and skills and the optimisation of existing assets without increasing the financial burden in times of austerity. Greater attention to cross-border and geographically vulnerable areas and implementation of a culture of prevention will complement this new approach to ensure a rapid, speedy and effective response to any future needs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Fidanza on the report he has drafted, which fits logically into the framework of actions undertaken and promoted at Union level relating to tourism, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Union new powers in this field. I must stress the fact that I endorse the statement about the importance of Europe as a single destination for certified, quality tourism, as well as the intention to promote this idea by turning it into actions in terms of structures, allocation of resources, funding, and coordination of actions among the various levels of government in the countries of the Union. This is an approach to be valued and rewarded, given that the sector in question – with its implications in terms of the percentage of GDP produced, employment and new opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, and emphasis on environmental protection and enhancement – is in a position to develop and thus to respond to the major challenges of today. For all these reasons, I believe this report is positive, as it sends out an important signal for the promotion of a European tourism policy. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disaster that struck the Gulf of Mexico more than a year ago has prompted the European Commission to reflect on legislation relating to offshore oil activities. The European Parliament, too, wished to express its position on the matter, with this report. It has adopted a text that calls for the sector’s operators to have adequate technical and financial capacity and which aims to establish high safety standards so as to confirm the European Parliament’s leading role in promoting the safety of offshore activities. The new measures requested of the Commission in this regard will have to focus on international coordination and on a realistic approach that combines all of the quality procedures that exist in the sector and prevents the creation of new bodies or additional red tape, which could well delay the achievement of specific final objectives. In concrete terms, the report demands an improvement in communication and information and knowledge sharing mechanisms, in addition to greater accountability on the part of companies operating in the sector, and calls for the role and powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency to be strengthened and expanded. For all these reasons, I believe that the result achieved thanks to the negotiations on this text, for which we voted, is a positive one. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 As shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and as I have therefore followed this subject particularly closely, I feel I must congratulate Mrs Jordan Cizelj on the invaluable work she has done. Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations, due not least to the highly sensitive international context, the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent, harmonised legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely, no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future. I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies. The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards; greater attention to technical and scientific advances, particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility; increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people’s health; and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with transparency and with the role of licence holders.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation for relations with Central Asia and Mongolia, which I am honoured to chair, went to Mongolia just three weeks ago on the occasion of the eighth interparliamentary meeting of the European Parliament and Mongolia. It was a very useful and interesting experience. Mongolia is a country that deserves to be better known and there are not many opportunities in this Parliament to give it the attention that it should certainly receive. It is a country characterised by a multi-party parliamentary system, separation of powers, comparatively free public opinion and a level of human rights protection that stands out compared with the situation in many other countries in the region. It is also a country with development problems that is grappling with a difficult environmental situation and ongoing desertification. It has also been hit by extreme weather conditions recently. At the same time, it is very rich in natural resources – copper, gold, uranium and rare earths – which could attract a considerable influx of capital in the not-too-distant future. For all the above reasons, I think it is important to send out a signal of support for Mongolia at this crucial stage in its development, and to foster the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law as well as parliamentary control, so that the financial resources that become available to Mongolia can be used in future for the benefit of the people. We have to encourage Mongolia in its desire to develop closer relations with the European Union and urge it to adopt our standards and industrial regulations. We should help it move towards a market economy and more intense economic and trade relations, which are made possible by a climate of legal certainty and the development of the rule of law. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that the European Union and Mongolia are concluding will play a decisive role in this context. For all these reasons, 45 other Members and I have tabled this oral question. In this question, we ask the Commission to provide further details on the main characteristics of the agreement and the foreseeable schedule for its ratification. I would like to point out that the agreement has already been initialled, but there is currently deadlock over its signature, apparently because of doubts raised by a Member State on the legal basis used for some of the clauses. Additionally, we would like to ask the Commission about the possibility of opening a European Union delegation in Ulaanbaatar in the near future. Such an initiative could, in fact, significantly contribute to a further deepening of our political and economic cooperation with that country. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, the report on the labelling of textile products which we endorsed today marks an important step towards simplifying legislation for the benefit of consumers and all the European manufacturers working in the industry. With this regulation, we are laying down new rules on labelling in the textile industry; we are focusing increasingly on innovation in the sector and on speeding up the integration of European legislation, in order to benefit from innovative products safely. The text proposes, in fact, to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation, simplifying the existing regulatory framework and improving the transparency of procedures. Therefore, we cannot help but applaud the positive result achieved today in safeguarding European production. At the same time, however, we cannot fail to mention the indication of the country of origin issue. We hope that a further step forward can be taken soon with the approval of legislation regulating indications of origin in this sector as well. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of providing adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power plants has already been tackled by European Union legislation on the safety of the nuclear sector. Today, in the light of recent international events and the consequent decisions of the governments of the Member States in this regard, the issue is highly topical. We have expressed our backing for Mr Marinescu’s work, which deals with the specific cases of a number of countries which, upon accession, took on particular obligations on decommissioning nuclear power plants and received special support from the European Union for this very activity. Specific cases aside, on this issue we are duty-bound to establish an effective monitoring system to check and test the nuclear plants within EU territory. Indeed, the number of reactors that are thought to need to be decommissioned in EU territory in the near future is rather high. It will therefore be essential – including and above all in such cases –, to ensure the provision of guarantee mechanisms for setting aside adequate financial resources required to tackle both ordinary and extraordinary requirements.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the report by Mrs Rivasi is the result of an assessment of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 which aims to set general standards of conduct that would apply in any future global health emergency. Following a long and successful revision phase, the report makes cooperation, independence and transparency its core principles. It calls for greater and improved cooperation between the health authorities of the Member States and European institutions, in order to address harmonised and commensurate risk management. Its objectives are a change in the strategy of Member States regarding their national plans for the management of influenza, including stocks of vaccine, the publication of the names of all the experts consulted by the European health authorities, and an efficient relationship of trust with the media responsible for disseminating public health messages. That is why we voted in favour of it. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the problem of falsified medicinal products is one that is having an ever greater impact at international and EU level, in terms of the increased number of cases as well as the advances in the development of these products. These are the challenges to which Mrs Matias’s report – the outcome of long and painstaking negotiations – sets out to respond. The report, for which we expressed our support, has established a regulatory framework which, taking as its basis more precise and detailed definitions, took into account all the actors, stages and aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain – safety, traceability and obligations of the distribution chain – in order to achieve a good compromise. These are some of the issues on which we must try to work in order to achieve the main goal of establishing more stringent standards and to prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, thus achieving a positive and more comprehensive regulatory framework that safeguards the health of citizens, protecting them from the risk of serious consequences.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease in particular, are an EU health priority. The disease in question has serious consequences for sufferers, and not just in health terms. The costs incurred for direct and informal care are, in fact, high. Indeed, Alzheimer’s disease affects not only the sufferers, but all those who care for them, too. Therefore, we need a European response to the problem, a coordinated response by all the Member States, a synergy of concerted measures that concern, in particular, the fields of science and research and that are responsible for strengthening prevention and diagnosis so as to improve the treatment – including innovative treatment – available, as well as the dissemination of information among the Member States on the results achieved nationally, thereby raising public awareness of the disease.

 Council Directive 1999/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens under various systems of rearing with the added objective of protecting against unfair competition among producers in the different Member States. Although I support the principles of this directive, it must not be taken lightly that, as things stand, a great many European producers – having begun the process of converting their facilities – have run into real problems in completing the transformation and risk not being ready before 1 January 2012, the final deadline for complying with the directive. If we also bear in mind the real difficulties faced by many producers in obtaining financing to support conversion processes and the serious economic difficulties that they are still having to deal with today – with serious repercussions on the stability of their businesses and employment levels – I am convinced that something has to be done. Member States should intervene to promote measures that can help European producers in the poultry farming sector who, aiming to adapt to the new European legislation, have embarked on the process of converting their facilities but are very unlikely to complete it before the start of 2012.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Fjellner aim to integrate and complete the existing European Union regulations on the subject, bringing them up to date and making them capable of tackling the challenges that technological development has created and poses for public health. In our opinion, at its centre is the patient and his or her right to be informed and have access to scientific information, which has now become both qualitatively and quantitatively better and must be monitored, starting with a more precise and accurate distinction between scientific information and advertising. Indeed, the reports use precise and standardised criteria to establish the types of information to be provided, which data are optional or not, as well as the channels through which they may be made available, thereby setting out the obligations of pharmaceutical companies and Member States. Based on this understanding, we express our support for this report, recognising its merits not only in terms of health but also in social terms. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I would like to express my appreciation for the important contribution that this work will make in identifying a set of measures to be taken to overcome the current crisis and prevent the possibility of further crises. After the limits of a system of self-regulation were highlighted to a worrying degree by the recent financial crisis, it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to choose a global control system. The current phase of economic and financial instability, the most severe for decades, has led to an employment and social crisis on such a scale that decisive action is required to eliminate its negative repercussions and prioritise the opportunities that open up in a globalised economy. The crisis in recent years has sorely tried most of the advanced economies. Recovery is still slow for some countries even today, and the ongoing fragility of financial markets makes global coordination and the choice of appropriate economic and industrial strategies key aspects in combating the financial crisis. Global supervision should, in fact, promote the stabilisation of solid financial markets and sustain the current recovery, guaranteeing strong growth in demand and employment levels.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measure sets out to reinforce and rationalise the system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union: these are the ambitious goals set by the McAvan reports, which aim to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC respectively. Thanks to a close and effective working relationship between the European Council and Parliament, and between the parliamentary committees responsible for this area, we have reached the point where we are able today to discuss a proposal that aims to improve the EU pharmacovigilance system, and to conclude the consistent work that the European Union has carried out in this field over more than a decade. Simplification, transparency and rationalisation may be considered the key points of these two reports, which propose measures aiming to guarantee the best possible protection of public health on the basis of standards that are harmonised throughout Europe. Reference is made to an extensive series of actions, ranging from better definition of the roles and responsibilities of the main national and international stakeholders seeking to ensure a new, more informed and active involvement of patients, who are given a fundamental role in the system, to the increased transparency of information concerning the safety of medicinal products and the simplification of activities involved in communicating, recording and evaluating suspected adverse reactions. The current pharmacovigilance system must also be improved through closer cooperation at European, national and regional levels. Effective participation at all three of these levels will, in fact, ensure a profitable exchange of information on the side effects of medicinal products. When reorganised as a network, with Internet support, the new pharmacovigilance system will be able to ensure a high level of information sharing and security to benefit patients, national authorities and healthcare professionals.

 Thank you Mr President and excuse me. With my speech, I would like to highlight how the progressive erosion of European farmers’ incomes, despite growing profit margins for the agro-industrial sector, is causing a worrying economic marginalisation of agricultural workers, with the consequent abandonment of agricultural activities. This requires, therefore, a change of course, which the European Commission itself recognises and which the report being examined and put to the vote in Parliament this morning – for which I would like to express my support – highlights with ample explanations and suggestions on a legislative and departmental level as well. Indeed we must combat global speculation on commodities and guarantee the security of supply. Moreover, greater price transparency must also be guaranteed, not only to give farmers justice and dignity, but also to correct the serious imbalances that exist with regard to bargaining power and to prevent abusive practices between the various operators. Agriculture must be confirmed as a sector of economic and social stability and it must regain power in the European and in the globalised commercial context. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge of preventing pollution from industrial emissions is a very current problem that involves a number of areas, including, of course, environmental protection, public health and the competitiveness of businesses. Precisely in order to have an integrated approach to these important areas, the directive in question was specifically aimed at facilitating the implementation of the best available techniques for controlling emissions, with harmonised EU standards for the authorisation of industrial facilities being developed in order to protect the environment, which is frequently threatened and compromised by industrial emissions. However, it does all this while also taking account of the need, which is shared by our industries, to maintain the competitive edge that is necessary to overcome the challenges of the future. A significant political commitment and intense and patient mediatory action were required on this issue. Thanks to this action, we have finally been able to reach agreement at the third trialogue. For these reasons, I would like to express my support for this report. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight that the situation in Kyrgyzstan reflects a reality which, for too long, has not been given the importance it deserves. The reality I refer to is the instability in Central Asia, which is unfortunately increasing, while hopes for democracy and economic progress, at least in many of these countries, are especially fragile. In recent months, Kyrgyzstan has suffered as a result of harsh conflicts that will leave a legacy of interethnic strife, at least in the immediate future, making the stabilisation of that country even more difficult than it was in the past. As has already been said, the role of the international community and of the European Union in particular is to aid Kyrgyzstan as much as possible in three ways: firstly, by providing immediate aid for emergency supplies and rebuilding the damaged homes; secondly – as regards the European Union within the framework of the Central Asia strategy and the instruments implemented in that context – by providing financial aid that is as long term as possible; and, thirdly, by providing political support to aid the process of restoring constitutional order and the development of the rule of law. The constitutional referendum held in Kyrgyzstan on 28 June, in what were clearly very difficult conditions, may be regarded as the first step on the road to restoring constitutional order. The elections of 28 June also received the approval of the OSCE observation mission, which obviously took into account the special conditions in which the referendum was held. The new constitutional order in Kyrgyzstan will be directed more towards a parliamentary system than a presidential system. This will perhaps allow for greater recognition of the various ethnic groups in the country and of the need to obtain the consensus of the various groups in such a divided and composite country. The European Union and Kyrgyzstan are bound by a partnership and cooperation agreement that provides for regular meetings by a parliamentary cooperation committee. Our hope is that our inter-parliamentary relations will resume as soon as possible, with the participation of a democratically elected Kyrgyz parliament. As has already been said, in the immediate future, Kyrgyzstan needs stability and our political and financial support: let us not stint on either. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is being asked, as we know, to express a definitive opinion on food information to consumers. I should start by saying that this has unquestionably been a difficult, long and controversial legislative process, which could not have been shortened. The aim, in fact, is to harmonise European food legislation through regulations that will make information to consumers transparent, thereby preventing a situation in which they are led to make confused choices or choices that may even be harmful for their health. The report by Mrs Sommer, who must be thanked for her efforts in bringing together a large number of requirements, is therefore intended to provide a solution to the controversies and the differences between the consumer information systems in force in the Member States. It is not by chance that national regulations still differ in terms of how to describe the nature of foodstuffs for sale, creating a system that differs from one country to the next and also fuelling unfair competition, to the detriment of potential consumers. On the basis of the European Commission proposal, an attempt is therefore being made to revamp the current legislation by involving both the food industries and consumers. At the same time, the report obliges the European food industry to introduce some clarity into mandatory labelling, as well as the labelling and presentation of the nutritional value of foods. In a globalised market, the European Union could not escape the need to adapt and reform legislation on food products in order to protect the food trade, among other things, and to safeguard it from increasingly invasive and uncontrolled international competition. There is nothing new about the fact that we are hearing more and more about the dangers posed by food products that surreptitiously carry designations and statements that often do not meet dietary requirements but are nonetheless passed off as products that are good for human health.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the popular unrest that has broken out in recent days in the capital of Kyrgyzstan has halted the progress of the ‘Tulip Revolution’ that kindled hopes of democratic change in the former Soviet republic in 2005. The European Parliament is following the development of the political crisis in the country with great concern. This is not merely because of the country’s crucial geostrategic position for Russia and the United States, but also because the stability of Central Asia, its political and economic development and interregional cooperation is of interest to the EU, not least, due to the importance of Central Asia for our energy supplies and our economic and trade partnership. The risk of civil war breaking out and of a ‘second Afghanistan’ must be averted. We put our faith in the diplomatic mediation that the Presidents of the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan – the latter in his capacity as the current president of the OSCE – are deploying in their negotiations with the interim Kyrgyz Government for the establishment of public order and constitutional legality, in order that free elections can be held and the country’s problems resolved. As Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation, I hope, even despite the recent ethnic clashes, that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan.

The issue of an agricultural product quality policy has found an authoritative and unanimous response from the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby making the existing legislation more complete. European agricultural producers have finally gained recognition in European legislation on the quality of their produce linked to the region of production. This represents a guarantee for sheltering them from market globalisation and for ensuring that the ‘informed’ consumer can reject produce that does not bear the obligatory geographic indication of origin, that is not certified clearly, and that does not comply with marketing and anti-counterfeiting rules. Consumers will be able to make their purchasing choices in full knowledge of the rules relating to their desired product. The European Parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers. The health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former. An amendment of mine on the protection of product characteristics, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved, recognises that the regions have an essential role as producer partners, in particular, of the producers of traditional and organic products, and calls for regions to be involved in the recognition and promotion of products with a geographical indication, traditional products and organic products. I am pleased to note the recognition of this indication. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I congratulate the European Commission on having submitted to the Council the amended regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union. The report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up-to-date way, and does so for two reasons. The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively. The report is in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, in which particular attention is paid to energy policy by means of the strengthening and coordinating of its methods and of the investments required for the sector. The Copenhagen Summit’s failure to satisfy the world’s political leaders means that the policies to be pursued require a change of strategy. The European Parliament is paying particular attention to the problem with the aim of overseeing energy investments in the construction, transport and storage of associated energy products, so as to satisfy the production and distribution industries and hence safeguard consumers’ health. The second reason is that, since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand – like imports – is growing every day, EU energy policy must focus on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency.Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Donskis’s report on the European Union’s policy on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2011 for a number of reasons. The report highlights the importance of international humanitarian law (IHL), and particularly urges the EU to take a stronger stance in implementing IHL and considering it when entering into bilateral agreements with third countries. Not only is it important that the EU respect human rights, but we should do everything possible to ensure that basic standards of human rights are upheld in countries throughout the world, which the report directly encourages. Additionally, I support the inclusion of women’s rights in the report, as establishing human rights relies upon establishing equal rights between the sexes. Barbara Matera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I have drafted an opinion for Mr Ferreira’s report on small-scale and artisanal fisheries. There are still too many legal and social obstacles preventing women’s full participation at all levels in the fisheries sector. Women work on fishing boats and are involved at all levels of the production chain: in fish capture, in breeding and harvesting in aquaculture, and in processing and placing on the market; they are boat-owners; they organise fishing activities and provide support to the fishermen at sea. The work of women in the fisheries sector needs to be made more visible, especially in the artisanal sector, since 85 % of women active in this sector feel they are discriminated against. This is seen as an exclusively male sector: there are obstacles to women’s advancement and the support structures available are inadequate. I am pleased that Mr Ferreira has given due attention to this opinion and that Mr Damanaki has underlined the importance of cooperation between the Committee on Fisheries and the other parliamentary committees. I would therefore like to underline some of the priority actions to be taken at EU and Member State level. What is most important is the protection of the legal and social status of women working in the sector so as to ensure equal wages, in other words safeguarding social and economic rights. Above all insurance must be provided for covering risks at sea. Much has been done, but much more can be done. Barbara Matera  (PPE

The European agri-food sector has the ability to prosper and assist economic stabilisation in the Member States, and developing more extensive promotion measures both for the internal European market and for external market shares. For these reasons, it is important that local, regional, and external promotion measures are adopted, with the focus placed on short food-supply chains and local farming systems. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first and foremost to thank the rapporteur for having taken on board all – or most – of the points in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am Vice-Chair. Economic crises compromise efforts made towards gender equality: the employment rate among women falls ever lower and the gender pay gap grows ever wider. The contractual safeguards for many women and mothers are still precarious and the number of women in leadership positions and in the political, science and technology sectors is low. Adequate funding for EU programmes is necessary to reduce the gender pay gap and encourage access for women to highly skilled jobs. An increase in the labour market participation of women would free an important amount of talent that has remained untapped for many years. In the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we proposed uniform formats for women’s integration, and above all specific measures targeting vulnerable groups of women.

The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 come at a difficult economic and financial time, when the Member States are being forced to introduce harsh fiscal consolidation measures. However, the EU budget can only be seen as offering huge added value with regard to investments made at national level. The Commission’s proposal freezes ceilings at their 2013 levels and significantly weakens the requests made by the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 to strengthen European policies to enhance competitiveness, small and medium-sized enterprises and sustainable infrastructure. Parliament hopes for a ‘responsible’ reaction from the Council.

The European Year of Citizens is intended to increase the active civic and democratic participation of Union citizens. As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I support this proposal because I hope that it will not only reinforce equality and solidarity among the Member States, but will also enhance gender equality among citizens and increase the participation of women in the economic, political and social life of the European Union.

First and foremost, the provisions will establish uniformity throughout the EU for victims’ rights and protection, ensuring all victims of crime will be treated in the same way regardless of the Member State in which they are located. Notably, the report encourages the individual assessment of a victim’s needs, particularly those with specific needs, when determining the methodology of protection. It recognises the unique nature of gender-based discrimination and urges particular protection for those who are repeat victims of crime. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 as a support system for workers impacted by global structural change in trade patterns. Denmark’s application in respect of the Odense Steel Shipyard notes that the country’s workforce is highly concentrated in manufacturing and metallurgy, but has lost business because many global market shares have been transferred to Asia. By mobilising the EGF with an amount of EUR 6 455 104, workers will be helped to return to the labour market, which is especially important because these employees have highly specialised training in their field which it is nearly impossible to apply in other industries. For these reasons, I voted in favour of Mr Bendtsen’s report. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– Spain’s application for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the construction sector in the NUTS II region of Aragón addresses redundancies caused by the current economic crisis. The financial and economic crisis has greatly impacted Spain’s construction industry due to a lack of demand for new construction. This trend is in line with the falling demand for new construction that exists throughout Europe, but the condition of the housing market has degraded at an even more rapid pace in Spain. A mobilisation of the EGF for an amount of EUR 1 300 000 will allow workers that had been employed in construction to diversify their skills, which will alleviate some of the burden of unemployment in Aragón.

 I voted in favour of Mr Gustafsson’s report on the role of women in the green economy, as developing the green economy involves creating new jobs, in particular, for prevalently male sectors where the participation of women is still limited. By analysing data and statistics regarding different employment areas in the European Union, I noted with regret that a high concentration of ‘green’ jobs are normally filled by men. In most cases, women involved in the transition linked to new job opportunities are underpaid compared with men. The disparities in access to different green trades and professions are a threat to the equality of the transition towards a greener labour market. To facilitate women’s access to new ‘green’ jobs, I would argue it is vital for the Commission and Member States to organise specialist training courses in areas such as renewable energy, thereby giving women real opportunities to join the labour market in remote areas where unemployment affects young people in particular. I am referring, for example, to the potential for women to succeed in the area of solar and wind power in southern Europe. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

Emergency situations are arising in an increasing number of contexts and for this reason the simplification of access to rights and better knowledge of these among citizens is desirable, so that they are in a better position to benefit from solidarity between Member States if their own country is not directly represented in the third country or if they are having difficulties reaching their own embassy. For this reason I am in favour of the report, though I recognise that further action and future clarifications will be necessary, for example concerning the role and functions of the delegations and the definition of the necessary financial resources to ensure they can be implemented.

Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Foster’s report, which calls for strong action from the Commission, including sanctions, in order to force Member States that are violating their obligations under the Single European Sky (SES) legislation to fall into line. The SES is an ambitious project aimed at creating a single airspace that would allow increased capacity and efficiency in air traffic management, also bringing economic and environmental benefits. The implementation of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research programme, which is the technological pillar of the SES project, is a vital aspect for its success, especially from 2015 on, when the program should be launched. Unfortunately, there are still several gaps in the single airspace project, particularly with regard to the realisation of Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB). In this regard, I welcome the new impetus given a few days ago by Italy and other countries involved in the ‘Blue Med’ FAB, which is of strategic value since it involves the Southern Mediterranean countries.

Madam President, passenger rights are central to the debate on transport. The concept of accessibility is the cardinal point of this report, including physical accessibility for all to destinations and information. Correct information must be available to travellers, using various means and covering a range of needs. Furthermore, passengers must have access to assistance through helpdesks with adequately trained and competent staff. Finally we call for revision of the Package Travel Directive 90/314/EEC, in order to ensure that consumers and firms in the sector have a clear legal framework for both standard situations and exceptional situations, eliminating abusive and unfair practices and ensuring greater transparency. Mr Bach’s report addresses all of these aspects and I therefore voted in favour of it. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I welcome Mr Simpson’s report. Suitable and up-to-date training of crews is essential for ensuring safety on board ships. Training should therefore comply with international standards, and be standardised, in order to overcome problems often posed by the presence on board a given ship of workers from different countries and trained according to different systems. All actions aimed at upholding safety in the sector must be regarded as essential, in particular the strengthening of provisions on issuance of certificates of competence, medical fitness and fitness for duty, and the proposals on better working conditions and control of alcohol abuse. It is essential to aim for greater involvement of the Commission through greater transparency, and for easier access to information in order to a provide fuller picture of the employment situation in this sector.

 I welcome the report by Ms García Pérez. I believe that simpler and faster registration procedures will encourage farmers to register their quality products and ingredients and to communicate their added value more effectively to customers, who will thus be in a position to make more informed choices. The role of foodstuff producer groups – by which I mean all producers, processors or producer-processors – is important, and they will be able to take steps to protect their own trade names and to promote the authenticity and reputation of their goods. This vote coincides with the start of discussions over the reform of the common agricultural policy 2014-2020, where we will also talk about managing supply, which the regulation adopted here does not address.

 I welcome the resolution on the proposals regarding a European banking union. The fact that we are voting on this resolution the day after the Commission tabled two proposals to enhance banking supervision shows that Parliament – the only democratically elected EU institution – is keen to make a major contribution to putting together the instruments that will give the Union and the single currency greater stability, without negative repercussions for Member States that are not part of the euro area. In my view, it is essential that we achieve a fully functioning European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as soon as possible, which, although it certainly further limits Member State sovereignty over public finances, at least has the benefit of excluding the contributions they pay from the calculation of their sovereign debts.

 The resolution on the alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in European countries by the CIA focuses on an issue that continues to cause controversy, including in Italy. Collating flight data managed by Eurocontrol suggests that there is an illegal system that has led to suspicious disappearances, which is unacceptable. All responsibilities need to be established so that there is no recurrence of similar cases in the future. The fight against terrorism in the EU should be conducted in compliance with EU law and the sovereignty of the Member States, which have the right and the duty to prosecute those suspected of terrorism and bring them to trial.

 I am dissatisfied by today’s vote on beef labelling. Although it was only by a few votes, we were unable to keep voluntary labelling. A specific request from the entire Italian supply chain, which rightly expressed concern, given that abolition involves a financial loss for farmers – many have already invested in and successfully use this tool – as well as a competitive disadvantage compared with other markets, as Italian production is characterised by its quality. The fact that the rapporteur has decided to refer the text back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) bodes well, considering that in Council, a majority block may form to reintroduce compulsory labelling systems to defend the principles of quality and traceability.

 I welcome the vote on Mr Dorfmann’s report, which aims to safeguard an important sector and one which is an area of excellence for Italy and for Europe. Parliament is granting more flexibility to Member States so that the sector can also take definitive decisions before the entry into force of the common agricultural policy (CAP) 2014-2020 reform, which we are working hard on at the moment. With today’s vote, we are pursuing the objective of giving greater flexibility to Member States so that they can decide on the national financial envelope of the wine sector, all of which is linked to the proposal for direct payments under the new CAP.

 The huge delays in adapting the package of basic regulations on the common agricultural policy (CAP) to the Treaty of Lisbon are down to the Council’s intransigence and the deferral of the Polish Presidency, which prevented us from finalising the agreements that had earlier been made. Today, we once again find ourselves faced not just with the old regulations in the package, but also with new texts on the CAP and with voting on alignment to the Treaty of Lisbon, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in April 2011. The changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon – abolishing the old comitology system, allowing the Commission to exercise implementation and enforcement powers that amend the role of the Council, which, acting on a proposal by the Commission, can adopt measures to set prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations – show us the important role of Parliament even more. Accordingly, we need to align the body of laws to the new framework, bringing in an alternative system that is in keeping with Articles 290 and 291 and allows Parliament to act to protect farmers, land, products and agricultural markets.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached with the Council has resulted in some significant improvements. I am thinking of the establishment of strong, independent national regulators to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, which is one of the key points of the recast; the minimum five-year term for contracts between Member States and infrastructure managers, which will allow for better long-term investment planning; and the major focus on safety, both in terms of rolling stock maintenance, an important distinction being made between light and heavy maintenance, and in terms of the technological modernisation of infrastructure and trains to improve safety (particularly through the European Rail Traffic Management System). In short, the net outcome is positive overall, although one crucial point for the completion of the single rail market remains unresolved, which is the opening up of national rail passenger traffic. I hope the Commission will keep up the momentum it developed a few months ago and will put forward a new proposal in that respect by the end of the year. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text we have adopted today provides a good basis for starting negotiations with the Council. I am certain that this innovative instrument will lead to improvements in road safety, drivers’ working conditions and competition in the sector. I am particularly pleased regarding the amendment that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on joint liability. I believe it should be possible to hold any operator in the transport sector liable for infringements of the regulation in question, and not just road haulage companies and their drivers. The text also calls for smart tachographs to be fitted to all vehicles, old and new, by 2020. This requirement will certainly entail a major effort by companies in the sector, but it is equally important to remain ambitious and gradually install digital tachographs even in those vehicles that use analogue ones. A final critical point is, I believe, the definition of ‘daily working period’. In my view, it is not consistent with other definitions given in existing legislation, particularly with regard to a driver’s rest periods or breaks, which would remain part of the working period according to this definition.

 Parliament’s adoption of the report recommending deployment of the eCall system is a clear signal of its support for the topic of road safety. Every year in Europe, there are more than 40 000 fatalities on the roads. By means of the eCall system, it is anticipated that this number could be reduced by more than 2 500, with a reduction of 10-15% in the number of injured, thanks to an increase of 40-50% in the speed and efficiency of response centres. Furthermore, it is important to remember that eCall will have minimal economic repercussions on final costs, which amount to about EUR 100 per vehicle – a perfectly reasonable price given the great benefits it will bring. It is now essential that the Member States and the respective mobile phone networks commit themselves to improving their infrastructure so as to guarantee this service to the maximum extent possible. As of now, 5 500 drivers have use of such a service in 10 countries: the positive effects achievable from 2015 with its introduction in all 27 Member States would be of vital importance.

 It is currently difficult for the consumer as well as supervisory bodies to distinguish between normal food products and those designed for specific groups. The reasons for this ambiguity could be differences in the interpretation and application of rules by Member States. That is why I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s report: we need a legislative reorganisation, with uniform laws that guarantee innovation, competitiveness of businesses and protection of information for citizens. The European Union must commit to achieving uniform treatment in the area of food so as to provide greater legal, economic and social certainty, covering not just the goods consumed and produced within the European Union but also those which are exported and imported. In this sense the regulatory provisions on gluten and lactose are of paramount importance as they are aimed at protecting an ever-growing section of the population. Figures show that food-related conditions are becoming more and more common, causing an increase in depression, stress and general poor health: let us help make these people’s complicated lives easier.

 In the Treaty on European Union, the Member States pledged to safeguard the principles of democracy and respect for human rights. Clearly all candidate countries must have satisfied these conditions before negotiations begin, but this does not imply indifference to conditions outside the EU. The last few years have been extremely dramatic for Tibet and the people of this nation have given a strong and succinct message: after 50 years of Chinese occupation, Tibetans are calling on the world for real change – a change that includes dialogue with the Chinese leadership, not an intensification of violence. The strategic partnership between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China should be based on common principles and values: the latter’s great economic dependence on exports ‘Made in China’ and the importance China attaches to its international reputation can influence such a change, if we make the effort. To guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, freedom of speech and association and the release of political prisoners, we need to take concrete action. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Gender-based violence and all forms of harassment and exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be wiped out. Full and equal participation of women in civil, social, cultural, economic and political life, and elimination of any kind of discrimination are the prime objectives of the international community. Protection of women’s rights has received a significant boost thanks to international instruments and commitments from the United Nations and the European Union. I think we are all in agreement that female genital mutilation is a serious form of abuse and torture of children and, I must specify, children from the age of just four. Today too many women are still subjected to these practices, which cause psychological trauma, indescribable physical suffering and repercussions on their health and which cannot be justified by tradition or as a symbol of identity. Ladies and gentlemen, we must all say a loud ‘no’ to female genital mutilation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this resolution. I must say that I am very sad to see the negative repercussions of this social depression, if we can call it that, and I am firmly convinced that we must act promptly to avoid a worsening of the global economy. The Treaty requires economic matters to be seen as an issue of common interest, with policies inspired by the need for healthy finances that cannot compromise the functioning of the economic and monetary union. The Stability Pact itself highlights the need to create incentives for prudent budgets, obviously avoiding excessive public deficits and strengthening surveillance. This surveillance allows us to identify risks as well as possible and take responsibility promptly. As the Commission has said, the EU must take shared responsibility, which I think also involves risk sharing. That is the only way we will be able to ensure coordinated and well monitored budgets.

 I voted in favour of this regulation. The main reason for doing so was that, for the first time, we saw a legislative text that really lays the groundwork for new and essential mechanisms for securing sovereign debts and building towards growth. Here, contrary to the view of my group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – I had no hesitation in voting in favour of eurobonds and the redemption fund. I voted in favour of the amendment on the golden rule, which would exclude investments from deficit calculations, and I regret that it was not carried. The way things are now, it is time to take urgent action: no more blind austerity; we have seen that it cannot work by itself. We need to mutualise debt while calling for austerity and, above all, we need to support growth before it is too late. The EU must take shared responsibility which, I think, also involves risk sharing. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the reports by Francesca Balzani. Following flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied for assistance to the European Union; the disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). I would remind you that the Solidarity Fund should be mobilised mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on the living conditions, environment or economy of one or more regions of a Member State. The conditions in the affected areas worsened, as always happens in these situations, because of the tragedy of the lives lost, the large number of wounded people, the families who lost everything and the very serious damage to homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructures. In these regions, the use of the EUR 18 million released by the fund will therefore help our fellow citizens to regain the peace of mind that they have sadly lost. Finally, let me congratulate the volunteers of the Italian Civil Protection Agency who, in those weeks, as well as currently in Emilia and Lombardy and as always in the past, have shown professionalism and humanity.

 I voted in favour of the reports by Mr Fernandes. Following the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied to the European Union for assistance. The disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the Solidarity Fund. I would point out that this fund should intervene mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on living conditions, the environment or the economy in one or more regions of a Member State. Conditions in the affected areas were made worse, as always happens in these cases, owing to the tragic loss of human life, the high number of injured people, the families who lost everything and severe damage to residential homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. Therefore, deploying in these regions the EUR 18 million granted from the fund will help our fellow citizens regain the peace of mind which, unfortunately, they have lost. Lastly, allow me to praise the Italian Civil Protection volunteers who, during those weeks, demonstrated professionalism and humanity, just as they have done in recent days in Emilia-Romagna and in Lombardy, and always have done in the past.

 I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report on cross-border voluntary activities in the EU. Following the visibility acquired through the European Year of Volunteering, it is appropriate to focus on specific measures to further promote volunteering. The ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ will train people engaged principally in cross-border volunteering. Its creation will make an invaluable and much-needed contribution to society, demonstrating the need to build a Europe based on respect for fundamental rights and the creation of solidarity and welfare, not just within national borders and not just in economic terms. In a constantly changing society such as that in Europe, enhancing solidarity is an asset. It enables us to address and overcome human, social, intergenerational and environmental needs and concerns. Today, the EU has 100 million volunteers who are helping to make Europe and the world a better place, and I am certain that this number is set to rise substantially. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 The conditions under which former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has, for months, been imprisoned and suffered various forms of physical and psychological violence are unacceptable. First of all, we must urge the Ukrainian authorities to ensure full adherence to the fundamental rights of their prisoners, guaranteeing fair treatment, adequate medical assistance in an appropriate facility, unrestricted visits by relatives and sufficient access to their lawyers. This situation affects the relationship between the EU and Ukraine; I therefore consider that the authorities in Kiev should not ignore what we are saying in this Parliament, which is yet another position statement following on from numerous interventions from the highest officials of the European institutions and Member States.

I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe, as I believe that we should not confuse homophobia, which is of course unacceptable, with family law. As the interpretation of the European Court of Justice confirms, there is not, and there should not be, a single family model, but rather we acknowledge the diversity of national legal schemes, thus excluding the possibility of predominance by EU sources. The European Union, in fact, is a community made up of 27 Member States, 27 different cultures, and 27 different traditions, and we have to protect unity in diversity, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The European Union’s task is to foster the harmonisation, rather than the uniformity, of family law. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

As we all know, the global financial crisis, which started in 2008, has had terrible consequences and repercussions, affecting the real economy almost immediately. The discrepancy between consumer demand and supply has had devastating effects on employment too, thus giving rise to serious problems on the labour market. Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and responsibility to combat the crisis. Among the various measures to be taken is the reinforcement of the single market’s stability through the introduction of innovative strategies, designed to achieve growth that is not just economic, but also social. I think that fiscal consolidation through the introduction of a common system of taxation for financial transactions could have positive effects on the single market, and for that reason, I voted for Ms Podimata’s report. There could be several positive effects. However, I would argue that precisely because of the now highly globalised nature of the financial sector and its services, a further shift should be made, by promoting the introduction of a worldwide financial transaction tax: firstly, the full 27 Member States and then the G20 should demonstrate cohesion in seeking this objective.

 I am voting in favour of Rita Borsellino’s report to strengthen the European Union’s internal security strategy. Over the last 30 years, a succession of serious events, such as natural disasters and terrorist and mafia atrocities, has profoundly shaken public opinion, thus hindering economic development, undermining the political integrity of the countries affected, and eroding trust between citizens and institutions. To regain this trust, a broader synergy must be created between social and institutional agents to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of respect for fundamental rights. It is no longer useful to examine social phenomena in a local context; we now need to look beyond national boundaries. We must ensure security by maintaining existing strategies and finding innovate ways to supplement them: to be credible, we must earn the trust of the European peoples and address their needs more effectively.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are essential transport nodes and factors that contribute to growth and territorial cohesion. Frequently, however, they only survive thanks to massive injections of public money. Nowadays, this is increasingly scarce, and therefore it is important that they should have a specific vocation in order to avoid a proliferation that would lead to non-utilisation or under-utilisation of the airport infrastructure. A typical example of this is the scores of airports in northern Italy located just 20-30 kilometres from one another. At the moment, there is no precise definition for a regional airport, and the Commission should therefore set common criteria for a proper definition. Finally, I am concerned about the formulation regarding the scope of application and, in particular, the exclusion of airports whose principal catchment area is a capital city. I do not think it is correct as a catchment area is not uniform and can change. Despite these critical points, I voted in favour in order to draw the Commission’s attention to these important airports. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approval of this resolution is a very important political signal in the fight against maritime piracy. Paragraph 30 of the resolution I proposed specifies that in the event of disputes between countries following military action aiming to combat piracy attacks in international waters, the national jurisdiction of the flag state shall be applied on the ships concerned as well as on the military staff employed aboard, as provided by international law. This aspect is crucial for avoiding future controversies like the one currently ongoing between Italy and India, and to defend the prerogatives of military personnel deployed in Operation Atalanta and as Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) on merchant vessels. I dedicate the approval of this text to Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, the two Italian sailors unjustly detained for almost three months in prison in India waiting for India to decide to acknowledge Italian jurisdiction and to allow these two soldiers to be judged by the Italian courts. I hope that European diplomacy will renew its support for Italy in this battle of civilisation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Moreira’s report on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. In order to promote the development of world trade, the 27 Member States drew up a common trade policy with third countries in an attempt to abolish trade restrictions and excessive tariffs. This trade liberalisation does not imply the non-respect of rights and obligations by commercial partners operating on an international level. I believe it is crucial to apply real reforms and to be seriously committed to tackling problems relating to market distortions in order to ensure consistency between corporate conduct and the rules applying to free international competition.

 I welcome Ms Niebler’s proposal on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union. Now, with the major increase in mobility within the Union and the concurrent major developments in the telecoms sector, we cannot ask our citizens to take on the burden of excessively high costs, especially for data roaming. I therefore support the further lowering of roaming charges – tariffs that ensure complete transparency and consumer protection. I believe that these new measures, in force from 1 July 2012 and running at full speed from 1 July 2014, giving customers the chance to choose a different roaming services provider from their national operator, will encourage a greater number of operators to compete, further reducing tariffs.

 I voted in favour of the report because it points out the need for enhanced legal certainty, more interpretative clarity and uniform application of the regulations across the EU regarding the rights of air passengers, including those with reduced mobility. Greater and more effective cooperation among the different actors must be secured so as to ensure that passenger rights are protected and to clarify their various responsibilities. It is also important to clarify and strengthen existing rights and to ensure that consumers are made aware of them. Knowledge of rights is essential in ensuring that passengers can access them. That is why information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey, starting from when the passenger is considering whether to purchase a ticket. To help ensure that rights are upheld, there should be contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues that arise when flight disruptions occur.

In this sense, Serbia is in a position to become an important player in guaranteeing security and stability in the region.

As well as the profound cultural differences and the fact that Turkey does not totally belong to the European continent, I am also not convinced by its progress made towards what is considered a European model, from which it is still very far in many different ways, including its under-developed democracy, its still insufficient safeguarding of human and civil rights, the still unresolved issue of Cyprus and the military, cultural and economic repression of the Kurdish minority.

 I voted in favour of the proposal because it aims to bring 26 trade policy regulations into line with the new primary-law provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. For example, the legislature will be able to delegate non-essential legislative acts to the executive, while retaining the power to revoke the delegation at any time. The affected measures are mostly designed to allow the use of trade safeguard regulations, apart from the regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. The Commission is proposing changes only where the Council decisions specifically provided for have previously applied. As a result of these specific decision-making procedures, European trade policy has hitherto, essentially, been explicitly excluded from the comitology procedures.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must note with regret the absence of Baroness Ashton from this debate. It would have been important for all of us to hear directly from her the latest updates on the situation involving the two Italian marines unjustly imprisoned in India after being arrested following the military operation against piracy in which they were involved. I am sorry not to be able to hear Baroness Ashton speak, and I hope that Mr Piebalgs’s response will provide more precise details about the progress made in the last few days. This is not just an Italian issue, it is very much a European issue, because – you see – the exclusive jurisdiction of the country flying the flag is a universally recognised principle of international law, and the Indian authorities having brought it into doubt risks undermining the very heart of the battle against piracy by the international community and the European Union itself, which, as we have said, is involved in the Atalanta mission. Therefore, I appeal to the EU institutions to make all possible diplomatic efforts to repatriate our soldiers, ensure international law is upheld and make sure that they are the subject of a fair and transparent investigation in their country of origin. In addition, Madam President, I would like to comment on the many speeches I have heard from my fellow Members from the radical left. Frankly, I am convinced that Europe must be committed on a political and diplomatic level to help Somalia and all struggling countries to develop, but this cannot be a sufficient response to the hundreds of hostages and families waiting for their loved ones to come home, who are tired of talk and want practical solutions in the matter of international security.

 Digital citizenship is a fundamental part of the European Union, and necessary for producing well-informed players in the electronic processes of democracy. The first issue we need to address is that of the digital divide and in particular the protection of the least-protected groups, including minors. The adoption of the report on protecting children in the digital world lays the foundations for a more organic framework directive that includes all the measures concerning children in previous EU legislation. It is undoubtedly necessary to encourage action to combat online crime, which has been successfully adopted by some Member States. But the cultural and legal differences among Member States make it hard to establish clearly which content should be penalised. Self-regulation adopted so far has proven useful, but has demonstrated limits that must be corrected with a unified framework of rights that tackles conduct that could have serious consequences for young Europeans. Thanks to this report, we are on the way to greater uniformity of intervention. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate before this one was on the 20th anniversary of the single market. We had that debate because the single market is one of the European Union’s main goals. If the single market were to fail, the entire European Union could fail. The same is true of Erasmus: for many young people – and not only for them – it represents the image of the European Union. Without Erasmus, many people’s perception of European unity would disappear. This is more the case than with the single market because with the single market there is also, but not only, an economic advantage for businesses and for our countries. There is nothing wrong with this, but Erasmus is different, it is about students wanting to break out of their confines and discover the cultures of other countries, share the experience of studying with people who speak a different language and perhaps have different customs and traditions, and discover, renew and strengthen our common identity and our unity. This is how Europe came into being, not through treaties or dreadful bureaucracy, but through genuine lived experiences. Perhaps without Erasmus, the single market would also mean something different, the spirit of it would be different and so weakening Erasmus could weaken our Union. The title of this debate is absolutely right: Erasmus is in danger, and the danger is that, without Erasmus, a different concept of Europe would develop. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and to tell the Council to make a real effort to find and authorise the funds, since the hole that exists is down to the Member States. The Europe of the future will depend on those who want to study and have experiences abroad now. Let us try not to let them down and let us be brave enough to show what Europe is really made of. I wish the Council good luck with its work and hope to hear only good news! Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, the Year of European Citizens is a way of focusing attention on the half a billion people living in the EU. It is a way of remembering that all of the other measures we are discussing in these days – the banking union, the economic and financial measures for combating the crisis – have the interests of citizens as their primary objective. The aim of the European Year on which we have voted is to enhance the rights attached to Union citizenship and the role played by the associations in the Union, reinforcing the right of students, teachers, artists and those working creatively to move freely. In short, it aims to strengthen European identity through concrete initiatives in which the citizens play the leading role. This is a real bottom-up approach to building the Union, and the reason why I voted in favour. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this rather wonderful report by Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, which we in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) helped to improve. The reasons for such praise lie, above all, in the acknowledgement of copyright as the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creation, investment and production. Dissemination of works, following their digitisation, is the main way to protect and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage. The European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, but much of it lies unused in the archives and libraries of our Member States, totally inaccessible to citizens. It is therefore right to make these works as accessible as possible to all. Indeed, the EU’s true wealth is its cultural heritage, which is unequalled around the world but is often neglected and loses not only its cultural value, but its economic value as well. The compromise reached between protecting copyright and allowing public access is the best way to reverse this trend and breathe fresh life into our cultural heritage, without violating any rights. It is true that perhaps not all the goals have been met, yet the glass is surely half-full rather than half-empty. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Schengen is an asset to Europe. Breaking down barriers between Member States was the first sign of something new that was starting to take shape: no more barriers but unity; no more controls but solidarity between states, which are no longer divided but united in a single great Union. That is why it is odd to hold this debate today. We seem to have taken a step backwards and it appears that we are abandoning the foundations of our fine Union. If Schengen fails, the European Union fails, but if Schengen is so important it should be protected, as precious things are. It should be protected from a Council that thinks it can bypass Parliament’s prerogatives, but it should also be protected from anything that can call Schengen itself into question. External border control should therefore be strengthened with all the legislative and technological instruments we have because, if our borders are at risk of becoming porous, this automatically makes our Member States less flexible, and they could call for stricter control, even within our borders, to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants. We cannot allow that and for that I thank Commissioner Malmström for all her work and her future collaboration on this issue. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on macro-regional strategies, especially with regard to the Mediterranean. Macro-regions have given a good account of themselves, which is why, at an historic time such as this, the Mediterranean, too, needs to be given a major development boost. The Mediterranean can become a place where culture, education, training, tourism, trade, environmental protection, transport and fishing can all come together to make this area take off, in conjunction with the ensuing Arab Spring. Tourism brings wealth, as does trade; education brings democracy and job creation; while culture, with its artists, shows us how we are all united and gives us a view of what we could become. All these factors make the Mediterranean important, particularly for all the other areas of Europe and the Middle East in general. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we decided to table this oral question because the issue is particularly important. We have always strived to bring citizens closer to the EU institutions. We do so in many ways, through the visitors to Parliament, through our local actions, using all the means of communication that our timescales allow us. We do this with constant echoes in all our resolutions; we do so, too, with the Commission’s public consultations. The Commission often uses these consultations to form the basis of their communications to Parliament and other EU institutions. In other words, the Commission bases its work on the responses it gets. Where, then, is the problem? The problem is that often, the results of these consultations are objectively embarrassing. A few dozen answers, sometimes even just single figures, representing the half a billion citizens that make up the European Union. Truly embarrassing. In 2011, the Commission had already committed to reviewing its consultation policy but to date, that is, mid-2012, we have neither seen nor heard anything. It is not a matter of lengthening timescales: we could even do it for 365 days, but the results would be the same. One of the most obvious problems is the use of languages. We very seldom go beyond the use of English, and hardly ever use any other languages apart from English, French and German. My mother could never take part in the consultations because she does not know any of the three languages in question and many of our citizens are in a similar position to her. It is not just a matter of ignorance, it is also a matter of the values we believe in and on which we have based our Union. Multilingualism, Commissioner, is one of them. Of course it is important to be competent in languages, but we have 23 of them, and why should a Portuguese, an Italian or a Lithuanian not find out about the Commission’s consultation in their own language? Of course, the lack of answers does not only depend on language but we have to start somewhere. Language is not only a great place to start but, Commissioner, also becomes a priority because, if we were to continue in this way, we might just as well make savings at the root by abolishing this instrument since we are making such a terrible impression. I want to conclude with a question to you, Commissioner: if you were in charge of a communication company, would the results of this communication satisfy you and your company? Marco Scurria,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this resolution is very important because, until just a few months ago, volunteering was an object of mystery for the European Union. Even though it involved 100 million volunteers responsible for 5% of GDP, the sector did not actually appear to exist. Then, despite a series of difficulties, we managed to dedicate last year, 2011, to volunteering and we all began to pick up on its excellent potential. Member States that did not have legislation on this issue have adopted legislation, others have updated theirs, many have increased the activities carried out by voluntary associations and, especially at a time of crisis like the one we are experiencing, have assigned an important role – a subsidiary role, as it is referred to – to the non-profit world. We started off from this point to accentuate the role of volunteering in the European Union, as shown by the report we are debating this evening. We started off with an excellent communication from the Commission, whom I thank for their work, as I thank the shadow rapporteurs and officials of the groups and Parliament who helped me draw up the report. What have we set out? First, a portal to tell citizens about the volunteering opportunities in various Member States and how to get involved. Next, use of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Manual on the Measurement of Volunteer Work and the United Nations Handbook on Non-Profit Institutions with a view to making available comparable statistics and data providing a clear picture of the significant contribution made by volunteering and of the needs of volunteers throughout the European Union. We want to give volunteering a high profile in sport, particularly at the grassroots level. We would like to recognise the important contribution also made by volunteering to protecting the environment, and to support volunteering activities in environmental education, crisis prevention and management, as well as in defending artistic and cultural heritage. We support the Commission’s proposal to establish a European Skills Passport, so that the skills acquired through volunteering may be officially recognised, both for professional and for learning purposes. A passport that should be a comprehensive document listing all practical experience, training and soft and vocational skills acquired through lifelong learning, including those gained through volunteering, if desired by the volunteer. We urge the Commission to put this European Skills Passport in place as soon as possible. We also support the Commission’s proposal to create a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which will increase the participation of volunteers in solidarity actions in the context of the humanitarian aid policy throughout the EU. We wish to ensure adequate and stable funding and establish and simplify administrative procedures, including tax incentives, for the organisations involved in volunteering work, including associations and networks, particularly for small associations with limited resources, with a view to enhancing their roles, activities and achievements as they provide such benefits to society. As Henry de Montherlant used to say, ‘Selfless acts are the stars of the earth’. Volunteering work has this capability. With its activity, provided free of charge, it can bring the stars onto our earth and plant them firmly into the soil. Our flag, Mr President, is made up of stars, which is why the EU must not fail to strengthen the voluntary sector and its world made up of great little everyday gestures. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I think it is a positive first step towards bringing order to EU-China relations, which are clearly imbalanced. The EU is founded on certain fundamental values. For example, we rightly ask our businesses to respect the environment; we give importance to workers’ rights, first and foremost, women’s rights; we do not make children work; and we do not have concentration camps with free labour. In China, however, all this protection and these rights do not exist. Far from it! There are still barriers to European goods accessing the Chinese market, and goods are clearly produced there at a lower cost, resulting in unfair competition with European companies and goods. We must establish true reciprocity in relations with countries outside the EU so that, where there are causes for imbalance, they are offset by financial and trade provisions that safeguard our businesses and our goods. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think there could be a better day on which to hold this debate. Today is Europe Day, when we celebrate the idea of uniting 27 countries to date, creating a single market, a common currency for many of our Member States, ongoing cultural and educational exchange; an exchange, in short, of feelings of greater togetherness and closeness. What medium unites us more these days than that of communication? A single internal telecommunications market cannot, in fact, be said to exist without telecommunications and if significant differences remain between domestic and roaming prices. Therefore, the ultimate aim we have set ourselves is also the hypothetical one of being able to eliminate the difference between domestic charges and roaming charges, thus establishing an internal market for mobile communications services. It is one of the aims that we must set ourselves. In this way, competition will improve, and people will be protected. It is an economic saving, because high roaming charges always constitute an impediment to the Union’s efforts to develop into a knowledge-based economy and to the realisation of an internal market of 500 million consumers. That is not all. The creation of a European social, educational, cultural and entrepreneurial area, based on the mobility of individuals and digital data, should facilitate communication between people in order to attain our aim, which is to build a real ‘Europe for Citizens’. For these reasons, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for her skill and her great capabilities at mediation, but most of all, for having attained the aims that have been achieved, given the importance of this issue. Obviously, I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are here because – as we have also heard here in this House – we are also celebrating our Europe, an institution created to bring together what are now 27 countries, to create a single market, to give some of these countries a single currency, and to bring together countries with the same vision and the same plans for the future, for culture, education, and much more. One of the key words of this Union is solidarity. Today, the basis for this debate is what has happened in Sicily, what has happened in Lampedusa, including in recent months. However, this situation is clearly not restricted to Sicily or Lampedusa alone; it is something that concerns Malta, and has concerned and still concerns Spain. Consequently, if this solidarity does unite 27 countries and wants to unite 27 countries, it must be seen and it must be felt. It is a solidarity that sometimes has not been felt by these countries, which sometimes have felt alone and abandoned when it comes to quite serious problems taking place on their coasts. Today, however, we need to develop these aspects, we need to develop the tools that allow us to monitor our coastlines, and we also need to establish bilateral agreements with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, agreements that will allow us to avoid migration flows of vast proportions. We have seen that this system is the one that works the best, that also gives people the chance to retain their dignity, not to have to flee the countries where they were born, and also not to deprive the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean of such human and professional riches. Accordingly, if we are to celebrate this Europe, let us celebrate it also by remembering the reasons that make us united, that bring us together, and also that allow us to have a better dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Italians, we are obviously particularly sensitive to this issue. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and the Commission for its words, especially its references to the clause and issue of defamation. This is an important report, because the rapporteur has managed to find the right balance between personal freedom, privacy and legal certainty. Often, too often, we see examples of defamation, sometimes truly unwarranted, thanks also to the freedom of information offered by new technologies – the Internet in particular – with what are effectively invasions of people’s privacy. Therefore, I think that the idea of setting up and creating a centre for resolving or acting as a point of reference in disputes is truly a choice that represents both freedom and the rigour that we were all expecting. I also look forward to hearing what the Commission has to tell us about this in the future, also because today, perhaps too many things have been left unresolved. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 The economic crisis – and its consequences in terms of the imposition of austerity measures and budget cutbacks – demographic changes, rapid technological change and the resulting demand for new skills pose serious challenges to, and call for far-reaching reforms in, Europe’s higher education systems, which must not have a detrimental effect on the quality of education. In a knowledge-based society, the future hinges on education, research and innovation. This report marks a step towards implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which states that, by 2020, at least 40% of 30-34 year-olds in Europe should complete higher education or equivalent studies, given the estimate that 35% of all jobs in the EU will require such qualifications.

 I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress achieved by Turkey, especially in underlining the critical issues that are still unresolved. As mentioned in paragraph 11, it is of primary importance that Turkey should have a modern and efficient, fully independent and impartial judicial system, guaranteeing due process of law for all citizens. The growing number of new applications to the European Court of Human Rights shows that the objective has not yet been reached. For the purposes of modernisation, the issue raised in paragraph 29 also seems fundamental. The government must (is called upon to) take all the necessary measures to increase the social inclusion of women and their competitiveness in the labour market, especially through policies aiming to diminish the gender gap specifically in secondary education. It is even more important to mention here that Turkey’s military occupation of the northern part of the island of Cyprus without any legitimate claim has been in place ever since 1974. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this seems like a film from the past. We had thought that by now, piracy was something that only related to the Internet and issues concerning copyright and similar issues, instead of which, piracy is precisely what we know about from books and films of adventure. Obviously, the modern incarnation involves boarding a ship with machine guns and rocket launchers, not scimitars, and quite honestly, my left-wing friends, it has nothing to do with class war. It is irresponsible to claim that pirates exist because of capitalist exploitation. There are no justifications for attacking, stealing and killing – and to say so means to be complicit in such crimes. It is a tragic problem, and it is even more tragic when the people protecting the ships in accordance with international law are arrested by the authorities of other countries duplicitously in clear violation of international law, as was the case recently with the two Italian soldiers in India, or rather in international waters, who were then taken to harbour in India. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the comments made this evening in the Chamber, also because I hope that protecting the law is truly one of the EU’s main priorities. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Berlinguer’s report on the Bologna process. The creation of an open European Higher Education Area has been a major achievement for all of us. Even more important is the need to harmonise the recognition of degrees and the qualification framework, as well as the complete revision of the national systems of quality assurance in university teaching. We still have students today who gain degrees through Erasmus that are subsequently not recognised by their own universities or only allow enrolment in universities that are too different and sometimes even of questionable standing. This is why we need to reinforce the process, in order to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of increased employment and economic recovery, based also on improved cooperation between universities and the world of business and work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not understand why we take so much pleasure in harming ourselves. You have spoken about Morocco as an important partner on a human level, while many of us have already mentioned that Morocco is an imperialist state that occupies land illegally, in which the United Nations has not succeeded in holding a referendum. You have spoken about democratic links with Morocco. Well, in Morocco 22% of the population has the vote, it is one of the countries with the greatest illiteracy levels, farmers and fishermen do not have the right to form trade-unions there and everything is in the hands of the King. You have spoken about convenience for farmers. It is a pity that no European farmers have noticed this convenience, as you are well aware. Explain to me why we are asking our farmers and fishermen to comply with rules that do not apply to those who fish and farm outside of Europe but who are allowed to export their products into Europe. Commissioner, please tell me why democracy is valid for all but sometimes does not seem to apply at home. Marco Scurria,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to renew my best wishes and my compliments to the President for his new position. I wanted to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fisas Ayxela, for doing an excellent job: it is a really comprehensive report which sends out an important signal in the field of sport. The rapporteur has worked well, including with all the shadow rapporteurs, and of course I thank them too for the result. Finally, I also wish to send my greetings to Commissioner Vassiliou. Moreover, it really is a good sign that we are holding this debate and have completed this report in the year when the Olympics will be taking place, the crowning moment for sport worldwide, a time when sport turns into a vehicle for the global exchange of values and friendship. For this reason, we have stressed that sport is a tool for combating discrimination, bearing in mind how difficult it still is, for example, for women to play sports in some countries, such as Iran, which therefore worries us not only because of its decisions on nuclear power. Another significant factor is the idea of supporting the designation of a European capital of sport under the leadership of ACES, the European Capitals of Sport Association. As we have learnt from the European Capitals of Culture, the promotion of activities for the young and old is at its height under such initiatives. The report also includes the fight against doping, a focus on gambling and the rediscovery of traditional games. I think, in short, that we have done a good job in terms of honouring as far as possible the EU’s new competence in sport under the Treaty of Lisbon. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Today I thought that we had changed the order of business, and from the tone and arguments I thought we had decided to talk about President Assad’s Syria rather than a European Member State. I have heard talk about citizens who are afraid to live in Hungary, about a ‘black plague’ knocking on the doors of the EU, about a constitution that is a knife to the throat of minorities, and more. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about Venezuela here. I have seen Mr Orbán, a prime minister, who has come to explain his version to us, and says he will comply with whatever the EU decides. We have to believe him because he has already done so with the law on the mass media. So why all this fuss? Perhaps not because we are really that interested in the institutional and constitutional aspects of the affair, but because we do not share Mr Orbán’s political choices regarding the family, the state and opposing strong powers, and the influence of the banks on political decisions. We must be very careful. We do not have the right to interfere with the internal affairs of the Hungarian people. All we can do is check compliance with the Treaties, and I think this is what Mr Orbán is here to do. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton stated that repression must come to an end in Syria and the phase of transition should begin. However, we are all wondering how this could actually come about: it is true that sanctions have become harsher, although we need to step them up further to make them more effective, but at the same time, the regime does not even listen to the Arab League any more. Therefore what is and what might become our future role? I think that Baroness Ashton’s efforts should, above all, focus on putting huge pressure on the UN, China and Russia, because if President Assad feels he has support in China and Russia, he will not feel isolated. The role these two nations are playing in the United Nations is truly objectionable, as is the funding that the European Union bestowed upon Syria – or rather on President Assad – until a few months ago. Was he not a dictator before now? Has he only just started depriving his country of freedom and democracy? We therefore need to step away from this concept of political correctness, in which anyone who does business with us is automatically considered worthy of financial concessions and a relationship with the European Union.

 In order to tackle youth unemployment in the EU, we need to implement a series of measures such as extending compulsory education to the age of 18 and creating ‘second chance’ schools. These schools would have teachers, psychologists and trainers to allow young people in situations of difficulty, poverty and early failure, also brought about by an excessively rigid existing education system, to be reintegrated into the education system with flexible learning programmes sensitive to their interests and extra-curricular pastimes. In the face of youth unemployment affecting one in five young people, reducing early school leaving by 1% would suffice to produce 500 000 qualified young workers. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, 52% of young people who leave school without qualifications remain unemployed. In order to guarantee Europe, which is in the grip of the economic crisis and rising migration, the concrete possibility of a return to growth and social cohesion, I believe it is crucial to focus on knowledge and suitable levels of education. The reform of the education system must involve partnerships between schools and local enterprises in order to offer students a better careers service. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first and foremost, to thank Ms Paliadeli for the patient work she has carried out in producing the second reading of this provision in collaboration with the other rapporteurs, including my colleague, Ms Sanchez-Schmid. Contrary to what was has been said of late, I am very convinced by this provision – because we can have different ideas and between us we can think things that are clearly different, but if we are here, we are here because we believe in the European Union and we believe in certain values that the Union has established and has seen emerge. These values are the fruits of a common history created by so many individual components in our own nations, in our own cities and in our own lands, but which have then shaped a common civilisation, history, identity and tradition. There is no need to rewrite history to say that Gdańsk was the gateway to the liberty and democracy of a large part of Europe. There is no need to call out the English soldiers who fought in the Second World War, because they were not fighting solely for England’s sake but to bring back liberty and democracy to the whole of Europe. There is no need to recount that this label comes at a price, as with anything of importance. In reality, this is a price which is comparatively small compared to so much of what we support, because by means of this provision, our territory will have factories, houses, libraries, historical centres, castles and places of worship that will remind us, in the diversity of our lands of origin and our nations, that we are children of the same culture, that we are children of the same land which we call Europe, and that, perhaps, if we always return to look at these places, we will find the answers to so many of the problems that trouble our Union today.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is never appropriate to rank crimes in order: they are all, clearly, despicable. However, the crimes we are talking about this evening are especially contemptible. Perhaps it is not by chance that one of the harshest pages of the Gospel is the one where Jesus says: ‘Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.’ Rarely are the words of Christ more damning. Some days, you go home pleased at having done a good job: today is one of those days. Thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, and to the other European institutions, the Commission and the Council, we are launching an important piece of legislation that includes: measures against sex tourism; a clear definition of the crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation, and of child pornography, as well as the aggravating circumstances; a guarantee of as much free psychological help for victims as each case requires; a decision on the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of these crimes; a focus on prevention; and much else besides. Even these days, when anti-politics seems to have the upper hand, politics is able to provide a clear and tangible response, in the first instance for the benefit of the many associations and volunteers who deal with these issues on a daily basis and for the police forces that carry out a highly sensitive and extremely valuable job which, in some countries including my own – Italy – has reached standards of genuine excellence and constitute examples to be followed. Today the important thing was to produce a European strategy to make our citizens feel that the Union is there for them, especially on such crucial issues as these. We can be quite secure and proud in saying that we have succeeded in doing so. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the minute I have to speak, I would certainly like to thank Ms Gardini for the excellent report she has drafted, not least because it comes out of discussions with the competent institutions and the associations working in this area. However, we need more than that. We need a legislative resolution that can go a step further and organise civil protection across Europe with no more gaps and no more overlaps. At a time when the role of the European Union is being debated, this is an area in which there is a demand for more Europe in order to develop united, coordinated action by the whole EU, particularly because civil protection depends on solidarity and volunteering. That fits in nicely with the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon and the current European Year of Volunteering. A financial instrument is needed as well, of course, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing this out and requesting an increased budget. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 The amendment to the Frontex Regulation was a necessity given ever increasing illegal immigration within the borders of the European Union. In this light, setting up teams of European border guards particularly helps a number of Member States to manage huge and sudden migratory flows, such as those that took place following the Arab revolts. At the same time, the procedures for the most vulnerable categories – above all, unaccompanied minors – represent the other side of this measure, where respect for the law and solidarity intersect to guarantee both human rights and the security of the Member States.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Syrian poet, Adonis, has written an open letter to President Assad in which he addresses the President and says that no one believes that democracy can be instituted in Syria immediately after the fall of the current regime; rather, it is unbelievable and unrealistic for Syria to continue the systematic violence to re-establish order. He adds that that is the problem and that it is necessary to lay the foundations of democracy from the outset, now, and not tomorrow. He then says that, on the other hand, without democracy, there will only be a retreat to the abyss. The ‘abyss’ the poet is talking about is growing larger every day in Syria: people filming are being shot, children of even 11 years of age are being imprisoned, some army officials are starting to become discontented and starting to desert. Many would follow them if they could more easily cross the borders with neighbouring states. Even today, the Corriere della Sera
, in analysing the situation in Syria, states that in Syria, the protest is not abating, Assad is not stepping down and the world does not see. Baroness Ashton, Europe is the only institution that can show the world what is actually happening; it is the only institution that can make a real gesture, that can help, but, above all, provide a prospect for the future. It is time to invest in the Mediterranean, thus choosing to envisage a world of peace and stability for the future. It is time for courage and for the European flag, as Adonis told us, to fly in Benghazi as a sign for the whole Mediterranean region. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to vote for this report because it sets out some fundamental elements for cohesion policy and for funding. These are, firstly, leaner procedures for national funds, and, secondly, the provision that sport and culture are also an element of cohesion that is both important and decisive. Perhaps the only negative element of this report is that it envisages only the three working languages of English, French and German as the languages that need to accompany the request in addition to the original language. For this reason, in any case, and for more general reasons I voted in favour and I congratulate the rapporteur. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, to be honest, I did not want to participate in the discussion on the G8, but I did want to put a question to President Barroso regarding culture. In the European Union, there are many programmes to encourage youngsters – and others – to meet, so that this becomes a real Union. For many youngsters and professionals, programmes such as Comenius, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action, etc. have represented the true coming-together of the European Union, inspiring truly European sentiments. (The President interrupted the speaker to explain that the debate was on another subject, but then invited him to continue …)
 I would like to know, therefore, what is to become of these programmes, at least as far as the Commission can tell, seeing that they are approaching their expiry dates and we should already have confronted the matter within the Committee on Culture and Education. How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on? I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), all the rapporteurs who presented reports this morning, as I believe that these reports allow us to lay the foundations for the Europe of the future. This morning, we are working on future generations, from children to our young people, whom we must guide into the world of work by means of the important flagship initiative entitled Youth on the Move. This morning, we are discussing expanding the Union towards the Balkans through culture, as well as developing cultural and creative industries. At a time of great economic crisis, it is important to emphasise that the only sector not making a loss – in fact, its turnover is actually increasing – is the cultural sector. We would like culture to play a part in the external actions of the European Union, and not only, Lord Dartmouth and Mr Kuhn, through well paid officials, but rather by constructing a better process for peace, stability and understanding between different cultures. Today, though, we must also seek to strengthen our programmes for culture, education and young people. For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action,
 and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union’s existence. For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon. We need to invest in all these programmes but, above all, we need to believe in them. Nobody is denying the importance of milk quotas, investment in industry and protecting the environment; but it is culture that will allow us to build Europe, and we will have to do this not with words, but with programmes and actions that we are able and willing to put into practice. Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations. This is how Europe will be built, and at times it may even be necessary to bend those regulations a little. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Baroness Ashton for the report she has put before us today. However, I should like to point out to her that public opinion in Europe is unfortunately not aware of the European Union’s presence. As many of my fellow Members have also mentioned, our external policy is still in a rudimentary state, as can be seen from certain events that have happened in recent days. Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf: it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection. It is our duty to intervene in that part of the world, just as it is in Syria. This country is in a really very serious situation, in which human rights and the chance to oppose a dictatorial government must get the European Union interested … (The President cut off the speaker) Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Speaking a few days ago at a meeting of industrialists, Italy’s Minister for Finance, Mr Tremonti, coined a new phrase – the ‘nuclear debt’. The Member States that have invested in nuclear power are the ones with the highest levels of public debt. How much does it cost to close first- and second-generation power stations? How much do the stress tests, which we are discussing at such length today, cost? Once a power station is shown to be ‘stressed’, how much does it cost to ‘destress’ it? Furthermore, how much does it cost to dispose of radioactive waste? No one has yet told us. As the European Union, we could begin to think of different options to show the Member States. Moreover, given that the Commission will have to provide us with a road map, why not begin to think of real investment in fourth-generation nuclear power – clean nuclear, or fusion – or even begin to consider an overall energy plan? We expect the Commission Communication to outline a road map on this subject and to try to give the European Union a clear direction at last in this sector. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this point of the debate, practically everything has been said, and perhaps that is exactly the point. We continue to talk and, as we speak, the landings are continuing and people are dying at sea and crowding in inhumane conditions on the Italian and Maltese shores, which are not the shores of Italy and Malta, but the border of Europe, gateway to our European Union, through which any of our 27 Member States can be reached. The time for talk is over, we are told by our citizens and the migrants who sought freedom and found themselves locked in closed camps. It is time to act, Commissioner. I call on you; we call on you to take the lead as early as tomorrow, after our vote, and to send a request to the Council for the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and jointly establish a true strategy for the future of the Mediterranean, because at stake is not only Europe’s credibility but also its immediate fate. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure and pride that we are discussing this strategy here this evening: pleasure because Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job, for which I thank her, and pride because it is an initiative that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have very much wanted. It is an excellent report because, of course, it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the Roma, and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach. We like it because it not only sets out rights but also highlights certain needs. We also dealt with it in the opinion that we gave as the Committee on Culture and Education. I am thinking, in particular, about the whole part relating to schooling for Roma children, in which we point out that schooling is both a right and a duty, in which the children’s families must also be involved. I would also point out that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion. Alongside the promotion of Roma culture, it is also important to recognise that the Roma should make an effort to learn about the customs and culture of the peoples with whom they live, so as to facilitate real integration. Perhaps the only thing missing in this report is a reference to Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens. In this regard, we have been waiting for a long time for the Commission to give us an interpretation of how to put it into practice, and we now need to know what it is right and fair to expect the Member States to do. For everything else, I again thank the rapporteur for all that she has succeeded in doing. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking part in the discussion a little shamefacedly, because the Commissioner has more or less told us that it is pointless to conduct this debate because there is nothing to argue about. We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions – in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber – we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission’s views – and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union. Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps – no, definitely – because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place. Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow. More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus. Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens. I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for her work. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis should give us the impetus to find out whether the European Union really wants a foreign policy role. Foreign policy is a serious matter: it needs strategies, firm objectives and clear alliances. We cannot continue travelling around the world patting everyone on the back and pretending that everything is going well all the time. Elections took place in Egypt a few weeks ago and we did not get up in arms because we realised that there was a dictatorship that was fooling all of us. Now that millions of people have taken to the streets, we are all talking about democracy and human rights. This is what we want, and we will try to make sure it happens, but we should be careful about following the crowd. I remember when the Iranian people rose up to get rid of the Shah, and we know how that ended, with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now. I hope, for example, that the Egyptian Government will be able to keep extremists at bay and play a stabilising role in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Baroness Ashton, more democracy is certainly needed in that part of the world, but so is more European policy. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are tackling yet another debate on the violation of human rights and democracy in Iran. This time, it is the case of a lawyer who protects human rights activists in Iran. Indeed, the idea is to solve the problem at source by no longer merely imprisoning people who fight for their rights, but to go directly to those that defend them, just to show which way the wind is blowing for those who wish to oppose the Ahmadinejad regime. I would place a bet today, Mr President, that in a few weeks’ time, we will be back in this Chamber to speak about another different case of all basic rights being violated in Iran. The violation will be disguised by some criminal motive that would be laughable were it not so tragic, such as acting against national security or propaganda against the regime, as in the case we are discussing today. I really do wonder, Mr President, whether Parliament should continue to have a delegation for relations with a regime that is the exact opposite of everything the European Union is founded on. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic, which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli, and which we have turned into this oral question. From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem. There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children. However, these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless. Clearly, these children are our priority. They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires. However, when these children remain in care for too long, they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders. All this is happening whilst, meanwhile, many families would like to open their homes to these children. I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt. However, we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions, as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children, obviously. We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children, because in a few years’ time, these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Vassiliou and thank her for her strong backing for this initiative, just as I should like to thank Mrs Paliadeli and all the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done. Europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulties at present. Indeed, we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty. Obviously, that is an important thing to do, but Europe must not lose sight of the importance of the values that have allowed the Union to emerge victorious from the innumerable challenges it has had to deal with during its history. Europe’s wealth lies in its history, its culture, its art, its leading figures, its landscapes, its symbolic places, its intellectuals, its philosophers and – dare I say it – in its civilisation. This label can represent all of this and highlight all the myriad forms of European identity that the Member States have contributed over time. We must now look at the negotiations with the Council to resolve a few differences of interpretation on several points. I believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily, given the importance of this topic. I also believe that as soon as this report is definitively adopted, we shall all feel more European, due to the values and traditions we share. I believe that through the Commission, the work carried out by Parliament and with the Council, we really are doing a good job for all our citizens. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question from Mr Martin under Rule 149(8)) Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I am very happy to respond to Mr Martin because we know that the bureaucracy issue is sometimes what distinguishes and separates European citizens from their institutions. Seen from this point of view, I think the path set out by this report is quite clear. We shall also talk about it with the Council. Once the Member States have decided which sites the European label could be given to and once we have a panel of true experts coming together, who are given the chance to select the sites within a necessary but not excessive amount of time – and we still need to work out who will have the last word on this, but it is an issue that we shall have to discuss both with the Council and Commission – I do not see excessive bureaucratic issues from this point of view. There are bureaucratic issues for many other measures but not on this one regarding the label, which I think can easily be followed in a secure timeframe and with clear results for all European citizens. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other than the Commission, I should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier. What we are talking about today is important because it is an instrument like ‘Youth in Action’ that creates the spread of ideas, closeness and friendship amongst the countries of the European Union, but also, and above all, amongst those that are not part of it, such as Switzerland or other countries besides. It is the great richness of our multiannual programmes that, through actions such as ‘Youth in Action’, ‘Erasmus’, ‘Erasmus Mundus’, ‘Permanent Education’, ‘Media’, ‘Media Mundus’ and many others, they allow relationships to be built between the countries of the European Union and third countries. Through these programmes, you see, we have brought the European Union to life, allowing many citizens – primarily young people – to meet, swap experiences, come to know others and to become known themselves. We have given teachers and workers in general the chance to improve their professional skills and we have given directors, producers and associations of various countries the chance to do better work. Hence, these programmes are important and so we were a bit concerned when we did not see them on the Commission’s Work Programme for next year. Today, therefore, today we are approving an important step, which makes the EU grow, strengthens citizenship on our continent, and – given that we spoke about it a little while earlier regarding the European Heritage Label – it is a step that contributes to creating this European identity of ours. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, amongst friends one can speak frankly and tell things as they are. Hence, we are telling Morocco that it must do much more to resolve the Western Sahara situation. The European Union cannot continue, and could not continue, to pretend that it is all nothing, because we risk committing a serious error. We risk telling those who have chosen peace, like the Sahrawi people did through the Polisario Front, that they have chosen wrongly. Those who do not send suicide bombers, who do not carry out attacks, and who trust only in international organisations do not make the news. For these people the powers of the world do not come together. Madam President, that is not right, because the Sahrawi are a courageous but mild-mannered people, they live their religion in the right way and their women have important roles in society. The Sahrawi are fighting for their land, for which their love is as infinite as their desert; and they are fighting for their identity, and it is not right that they are left to themselves. The vote we have striven for tomorrow in this part-session is an important sign that the European Union is working to take a decisive role in the destiny of this area of land. Marco Scurria  (PPE

I hope that the actions identified in the Action Plan will be carried forward within the planned timeframe considering their importance for improving the lives of European citizens. In particular, Italy has always supported the need to develop mutual trust between Member States of the Union and is in favour of continuing to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. From this perspective, we strongly support the approach of the whole Action Plan, which hinges on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, to be achieved by strengthening mutual trust. I would also emphasise the need to use all possible means to foster a European judicial culture, particularly through legal teaching and training. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 I take this opportunity to emphasise that a humane society is necessarily based on the principle of justice between the generations, and that age discrimination jeopardises solidarity between the generations, leads to poverty and is forbidden by the founding treaties. Work is more than just paid employment and both young and older people contribute substantially, including through their work in the family, to making our society more humane and improving the stability of services and workplaces. In this report, we call on governments to facilitate and recognise voluntary work that provides care in the community and family care, and to resolve issues of legal responsibility in that regard without delay. I also applaud this report for calling on the Member States to adopt measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members, predominantly women, of all ages in caring for older and younger members, in the context of solidarity between generations. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),  
in writing.

 Italy is the country where enterprises suffer most due to late payment by public authorities, with an average period for payment to suppliers of 180 days as opposed to the European average of 67 days. This leads to financial problems, a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness, particularly for SMEs. The directive we have voted for today discourages debtors from paying late and allows creditors to protect their interests effectively against such lateness, introducing the right to legal interest caused by late payment even when not specified in the contract. It also forces public authorities to pay within a maximum of 60 days from the payment request, provided the service has been performed satisfactorily. The adoption of this directive is truly a great help for our enterprises: nowadays, one company in four closes down as a result of problems of insufficient financial liquidity. These new rules on payments will mean that companies will regain their market competitiveness and no jobs will be lost. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciated the Commissioner’s approach to this discussion, because she stated that there are essentially no real infringements in Europe and also because she reassured us about the Commission’s role as guardian of the treaties and therefore also of press freedom and freedom of expression in Europe. Certain dangers nevertheless still remain. The Commissioner noted that almost half of the countries belonging to the European Union are subject to infringement proceedings to find out whether press freedom and freedom of expression are really guaranteed there. She also highlighted the preventive measures that must be implemented in these areas, emphasising however, that the problem is not specific to one State or to individual States. It is obviously not an Italian problem – Parliament expressed itself on this subject a few months ago by taking a democratic vote – and neither is it a political party problem, because we have just heard that in Germany, it is the socialist group that controls certain media outlets. The problem we must face in this Chamber is more general. Tomorrow, we will vote on a report on journalism and new media – creating a public sphere in Europe. This report contains certain guidelines on which our Parliament is beginning to express its opinion. We must talk about how to combine truth and freedom in the new media, but also in the more traditional media, because while it is one’s right to tell all, it is also one’s duty to tell the truth when writing or expressing oneself through a media outlet. We must also understand how to combine information with the right of citizens – of all citizens – to privacy. These are the issues we must tackle and to which Parliament must confine itself, not ideologies or certain matters concerning things that do not exist in any European country. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who – as announced by President Buzek at the beginning of the session – has tendered his resignation from the European Parliament in order to take up duties in his own country, and to whom I send my regards and my best wishes, because he has done a great job. This report is the result of his intentions, and it was carried in our Committee on Culture and Education by an overwhelming majority, with just a single vote against, for which I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report, both on my behalf and on behalf of Mr Schmitt. Before leaving for Strasbourg, on Monday I went to Rome to visit a private training centre that is achieving superb results, because it has succeeded in placing the vast majority of young people that it trains over the course of time. When I spoke to the director of this centre, he said to me: ‘Please help us, you in Europe too, to follow this course, to add weight to training that moves in this direction, which enables so many young people to find work; help us also to modernise the relationship between universities and business.’ The thrust of this report lies precisely here: today, 20% of young Europeans are out of work, of whom about 30% are graduates; a percentage that is so high that we are forced to ask ourselves very seriously about how we should approach the issue of training young people for entry into the world of work in these times, in this Europe, in this globalised world. We have then, in this report, wished to address directly the issue of how to improve the link between universities and business, highlighting certain key points: first, by giving priority to one of the strong points available to the European Union, namely the ability of its citizens to adapt to the constantly changing circumstances of the labour market; the fact that there is no longer any such thing as a ‘job for life’, and that these days, training and retraining is essential. The first point then is lifelong learning; the second, which, in our view, is of fundamental importance, is that of mobility. These days it is important, as we highlight in this report, to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds, and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and Erasmus for Apprentices, but also the organisation of postgraduate European Masters of Excellence programmes, in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses. Furthermore, more entrepreneurial universities should be encouraged. Such a result can be achieved, for example, through the introduction of a system of knowledge vouchers such as that currently in use in a number of Member States, enabling SMEs, in particular, to improve their research capacity without compromising the independence, autonomy and public character of universities. The third key point is that of research, namely, we see greater researcher mobility – in both the short and long term, across nations and between academia and business – as imperative in enhancing knowledge transfer. Finally, the possibility of extending the good practices in this area that exist in so many countries. I shall conclude, Madam President, by illustrating, in relation to this report and the outstanding work done by the committee, how convinced we are that Europe will not win the battle against China or other developing nations by means of low wages, but by having highly qualified professionals and highly competitive businesses, and in this process, it is of maximum importance that universities and businesses realise how they are interdependent, and that the authorities at all levels contribute to developing more efficient methods of cooperation. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish again to thank the Commission for its communication, which we have adopted for the most part. I should just like to dwell on a perhaps critical aspect that has emerged in this debate, because someone emphasised how fundamental the independence of universities, freedom of research and public financing are. We are all agreed on this, and that is why I fail to understand these critical remarks, because it is enough to read the report, where, in the very first paragraphs, we have written very clearly and stress that the intellectual and financial independence of higher education institutions vis-à-vis business must be maintained and no relations of dependency on business must arise on the part of higher education. It also emphasises that universities should, in all circumstances, maintain the autonomy to decide over their curricula and governance structures. This dispels any problems or doubts whatsoever in this area, which is why I do not understand what these problems could be, unless it is a question of old-fashioned ideological exploitation. Let us accordingly really give some thought to this, since this report sets out the conditions for effectively improving the lot of our young people and our students, because there is truly no one who wants to leave hundreds of thousands of youngsters in the hands of who knows what business purposes but, on the contrary, only wants hundreds of thousands of students to have the opportunity of studying, training and working in the society that awaits them. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to contribute to this debate because we are preparing to vote for what I believe to be an extremely important measure: it is important to rationalise the work of our enterprises, but especially to protect consumers. Those who buy must know what they are buying, and those who seek quality must find quality! However, it is also important to have an idea of the social sustainability of what we are buying. Someone has already said this – but I want to stress it again because I think that this is a specific point that must emerge from this discussion in the European Parliament – I want to know whether a given product is made in a place where workers are protected; I want to know whether that product involves the exploitation of children; I want to know whether that product is the result of unfair competition. So here we have a measure that I hope will soon be extended to other manufacturing and craft sectors, because I believe and conclude that this measure will bring Europe much closer to its citizens, and for this I thank the rapporteurs who have brought this measure into being, and the Commission and Commissioner Tajani for being a driving force behind it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something because, as was mentioned previously, the Italian Embassy and other embassies were attacked yesterday in Tehran. Because of this, Parliament and the Union should also consider expressing their solidarity, formally if possible, with our country and all the countries involved in this attack. We should also send out clear signals, though, and I therefore officially request that Europe should not be present at the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran and that this should be a clear signal sent by us to the Iranian authorities. I am also saying this on a special day for Italians, because today is the Day of Remembrance. This is the reason I, like many Italians – including you I hope, Mr President – wear this tricolour rosette in memory of the many Italians who were cast out on this day and forced to leave their own lands. Through this act of remembrance, I would like to express our solidarity for those who are struggling for democracy and freedom in Iran. For this reason, I call on our authorities not to go to the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Republic. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in European Union publications and on EU websites, we often say that human rights are the heart of the process of European integration and the key element of its external relations. The countries that have entered into political or trade agreements with the European Union are bound to respect these rights. Baroness Ashton, we ought to ask ourselves whether these requirements still exist in our relations with Iran and whether it really makes sense for us to send a delegation to Tehran without agreeing a programme with the Iranian Government which both sides endorse, one which will allow us to listen to the arguments and voices of the opposition, too. With regard to what we can do, we must, however, be careful even about talking of sanctions, because history shows that economic and trade sanctions have often strengthened regimes instead of weakening them, and that they have, in fact, weakened the people and, above all, the poorest of them. When we listened to certain people as a delegation, and heard testimony regarding the rights of women and minorities in Iran, they told us that perhaps it would be better to impose symbolic sanctions, such as cultural sanctions. In recent days, many representatives and intellectuals throughout Europe have been writing to call for UNESCO not to hold World Philosophy Day in Tehran. I think that this could be a commitment taken on by this Parliament too, remembering that Neda Agha-Soltan was a student with a degree in philosophy, and that this symbol could unite the European Parliament as it calls upon UNESCO to take this action.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to thank Parliament, all the committees, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. We have prepared a report which raises the profile of the voluntary sector. There are 100 million people throughout Europe who work in this field, and each day they selflessly give their time for the good of others and our community. This is the work we have done, increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU-wide activities for the benefit of the associations. I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič and the Swedish Presidency for the excellent work we have accomplished together. I think that this year will mark the beginning of Parliament showing a true interest in this area, which someone called the backbone of our society. Once again, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this important report. Potito Salatto  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not join my Italian colleagues in asking the EU to intervene to protect the two Italian soldiers because I believe that this should instead be the duty of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as it concerns two European citizens of Italian origin. Unless, in this Chamber and our institutions, we do not make the cultural shift that will require the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to take care of our citizens, especially when international rules have been flouted – the most basic of which is that a ship in international waters is subject to the jurisdiction of the flag it is flying – we will never manage to give Parliament a significant role at international level. This would cause serious damage and continue to leave foreign policy to be implemented by individual Member States, rather than creating the supranational state of Europe that citizens are crying out for. I was amazed when Baroness Ashton initially replied to calls for explanations from Italian fellow Members by saying that, ‘We did not receive any requests from the Italian Government’. Moreover, this evening, you, Commissioner, also introduced the issue saying ‘We are acting at the request of the Italians’. This is the wrong cultural and political approach. We are a great nation, a great continent, and we have to take care of our European citizens regardless of their nationality wherever they are, taking action to safeguard them in accordance with international law. I hope that sooner or later, Baroness Ashton will be capable of making this cultural shift. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out quickly to this House that the Bureau gave the green light for the European delegation for relations with Iran to travel to Tehran, subject to a few conditions.

I would ask you to revise this stance. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of what has just been said, I and my Italian colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Delegation for relations with Iran are absolutely opposed to this trip to Iran and ask the Bureau, which had decided to give the go-ahead, to re-think this action, which simply gives free publicity to the government in Tehran.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, aside from this issue, I should like to submit a problem to the Presidency. I think some people have not yet fully understood the role of the European Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon. I feel I must point out an underlying problem here: the Commissioner for Transport, Mr Kallas, has repeatedly refused to meet with the board of the Sky and Space Intergroup to discuss the Cost-Effective Small Aircraft (CESAR) project, which affects everyone in terms of the economy, the environment and security. I would urge the Presidency to call Commissioner Kallas to this Chamber to explain the programme he intends to move ahead with in this sector, which is extremely sensitive and important for the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to carry on listing the reasons for our disagreement with the Iranian Government. Since it has not been referred to here, I will only emphasise one of the most serious violations of civil rights, which relates to young people. The Iranian Government, having signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, nonetheless continues to impose capital punishment on minors. After this debate, I would like, firstly, Baroness Ashton, to take on the task of setting out a common approach for Europe as a whole and the European Parliament as a whole on events in Iran and, secondly, the inter-parliamentary delegation for relations with Iran to note that it must change its line. I, together with my friends Mr Scurria and Mr Tatarella, protested to the delegation: in an official statement, it stated that it wanted to visit Iran in any case, even though it had made a peremptory request to have the opportunity to meet and talk to the opposition. From now on, I would like the delegation to start singing from a new hymn sheet and to sustain relations of assistance, support and debate with the exiled representatives of the opposition, not least Mrs Myriam Rajavi, who typifies this situation. This is what the European Union should be doing, rather than imposing sanctions. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, I have held up my card three times now, and you have not given me the floor, whereas you have given it to Mr Schulz. I shall therefore now address my question to the speaker and to all those who have taken the floor, irrespective of their political group: have they enquired as to whether the centre-left governments have ever issued a law that could prevent the concentration of the mass media in the hands of Prime Minister Berlusconi?

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Jazłowiecka’s report, which lets us take an important step forward in the current debate on the economic recovery of individual Member States. While balancing the Member States’ budgets is a priority on the one hand, targeted social investment is also needed to prepare individuals, families and businesses for the change of economic climate and the demands of the employment market. As well as the sustainability of public finances, the Member States should also be focusing on how to create sustainable, quality jobs, on how to invest in training and updating of skills, and on fighting poverty and social exclusion. Hence the need for, and perhaps urgency of, a coordinated approach to social investment and therefore a Social Investment Pact for the whole of Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Mr Becker’s report, which provides a better framework for the contribution of social businesses to solving the current crisis. Social enterprises are unfortunately often seen as a sort of appendage to traditional forms of business, based exclusively on the maximisation of profit. Social enterprises, on the other hand, have a fundamental role to play in the development of markets and the European economy. They enable innovative responses to be made to economic, social and environmental challenges, through sustainable development, social inclusion and territorial cohesion. I therefore support the proposal to set up a Social Entrepreneurship Fund, which meets the primary objective of not exposing these businesses to unregulated competition, guaranteeing them adequate financial support and facilitating their market integration.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at a time when, for some nostalgic nationalists, speaking of closer European integration sounds provocative, we are about to vote on amendments to a regulation which forms the basis for the difficult but necessary process of harmonising and bringing closer together the national legal systems. Allow me therefore to congratulate Mr Zwiefka on the excellent work carried out and his success – after around two years of difficult negotiations – in bringing to a close the process of revising a regulation which has been of fundamental importance to citizens of the Union. Brussels I in fact establishes provisions which are of the utmost importance in ensuring sufficient access to justice and equality of treatment before all the courts which have competence in the European Union. It sets up common standards in civil and commercial matters, clarifying which Court has competence in a cross-border dispute, and making the sentences issued enforceable in the different States. The amendments made to the regulation are required in order to put into practice the wish to create a European area for justice which promotes judicial certainty and predictability of decisions, thus making transnational trade easier and strengthening the single market. That said, I believe that progress towards an ever deeper harmonisation of the standards of substantive law must proceed with the appropriate caution and attention in order to ensure certainty of law and to protect less favoured parties. For this reason, I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur in favour of consumers, who will benefit from the principle of protection for the weaker party. A basic principle under which, in a legal dispute between consumers and businesses, the consumer will always be able to choose a court in the Member State of his or her residence. Similarly, I share the prudent approach taken by Mr Zwiefka regarding the abolition of the exequatur
: while on the one hand abolishing the exequatur
 would allow recognition of sentences to be speeded up at a later stage, on the other I believe that measures for safeguarding defendants’ rights must be maintained. It is therefore necessary for defendants to have the possibility of contesting a decision if their right to a fair trial has been breached and if the decision goes against ordre public
 in the reference State. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my compliments to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. I hope we shall reach broad interinstitutional and political consensus on a regulation which forms the template not only for cooperation in the civil courts but also for political determination based on the process of European integration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very satisfied with the report by Ms Bastos, on which I voted in favour. Unfortunately, the severe economic crisis in Europe has had a negative impact on perceptions of the single market’s potential, among both citizens and businesses, and some governments and national political movements. There is a danger that this will cloud our vision of the excellent work done by the European institutions to revitalise and strengthen the single market, for example the wide-ranging public procurement reform and the revision of the Late Payments Directive. I agree that there is a need, as Ms Bastos has stressed, to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation between the European Union and the Member States. Fundamental measures – such as the setting up of unitary patent protection – are all too often blocked or delayed by institutional conflict and national egotism. In a period of crisis like the current one, we need to take a united approach to governance, one which enables us to introduce the necessary legislation promptly, to revitalise the internal market and strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, almost two decades have passed since the concept of European Citizenship was legally established, but still only 43 % of EU citizens claim familiarity with the term ‘citizen of the European Union’. They lack information and awareness of their rights: language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications are among the most common problems that EU citizens face on a daily basis. I therefore agree with the Commission’s initiative to declare 2013 the Year of European Citizens. I also fully support the rapporteur’s wish to have the scope of application of the Decision widened to focus on enhancing the awareness of citizens in order to allow them to make full use of their rights, and not just their right to move and reside freely. I also hope that the Year of European Citizens will not be another celebratory year but rather provide the foundation for a framework for the future policies, measures and actions needed to reinforce Union citizenship. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, it is clear that if the European Union wishes to emerge from the crisis, it should enhance the competitiveness of its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are responsible for the creation of 85 % of all new jobs in the EU. It is therefore necessary to harmonise national industrial polices to a greater degree, while it is also essential to achieve another objective: internationalisation of SMEs. Only 25 % of SMEs in the European Union have been internationally active within the single market. I therefore agree with the actions proposed by the Commission aimed at encouraging the process of internationalisation and the need expressed by the rapporteur for provision of specific information about priority markets together with details of the various support services available. In conclusion, I would underline the need for greater coordination of the various initiatives at EU level. At a time of rationalisation of public spending, we cannot afford to duplicate efforts or policies, risking the creation of pointless administrative and bureaucratic burdens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg and my fellow Members who, through their excellent work, have helped to bring to life one of the key actions of the Digital Agenda for Europe. The directive we are shortly to approve will help achieve two fundamental goals in the development of European copyright. First of all, it will enable the dissemination and enjoyment of works that otherwise would have risked disappearance from our cultural heritage. This initiative therefore fulfils one of the undisputed cardinal rules of copyright, namely, the protection and promotion of culture and intellectual creations. Secondly, this directive will make it possible to modernise and improve Member States’ legal frameworks by bringing existing legislation into line with technical developments and the need for greater flexibility. This will help boost the economic benefits of copyright by ensuring fair remuneration for work and identifying any rights holders under an absolutely solid regulatory framework. Turning to the use of orphan works for commercial purposes, I support the approach taken by this House, which allows commercial use solely in order to pay for the costs associated with the public service carried out by the various relevant institutions. Indeed, the directive does not address issues relating to profit-seeking utilisation of orphan works, but rather legitimate and cross-border access to such works, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity and depth of Europe’s cultural heritage.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we find ourselves debating the political situation of a country that since 2007 has been an EU Member State, and one that has been meeting its obligations under the acquis communautaire
. Among the legal requirements and political objectives that unite and bind together the Members of the Union, the rule of law is an indispensable prerequisite for the democratic organisation of society. That is why it is so important to debate the current situation in Romania, which is taking on worrying proportions as a result of a power struggle and an unprecedented war between its institutions. In this conflict a majority has tried to take over and dominate all the other bodies, including the Constitutional Court, the judiciary and the other institutions, and bend them to its will, while overstepping and sweeping away the balance between the powers, offices and institutions. It is strange that a certain part of this Parliament that always takes an interest in the level of democracy and freedom in the countries that make up the Union appears indifferent on this occasion or is even trying to justify the situation. I think this House and the Commission would do well to keep a very close eye on what is happening in Romania. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr Turmes’s report, which paves the way for adoption of a directive that will finally make it possible to overcome the differences between Member States with regard to energy efficiency. Though it does not change the non-binding nature of the goal of energy efficiency set by the climate and energy package of 2008, the directive imposes on suppliers and distributors compulsory annual saving schemes in terms of final consumption. According to the Commission’s figures, the measure will bring about a total saving of around EUR 20 billion in the costs of investment in energy generation and distribution. This is vitally important and will help reaffirm the Union as a global player, since the future geopolitical balance will be primarily decided by policies on the supply and use of energy resources.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, whom I thank for the excellent quality of his work and for his valuable suggestions. Despite the ongoing harmonisation of standards of protection and asylum, we still have a long way to go before creating that concept of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Indeed, the Dublin system places disproportionate expectations on those Member States constituting entry points into the EU. I therefore agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur on practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity. On this latter issue, I think it is absolutely necessary to make the best use of the complementarities between the different EU funds available, in order to translate solidarity into concrete action, including financial incentives for relocating beneficiaries of international protection.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Comi for her work and for the excellent quality of her report. Standardisation is one of the twelve levers to boost the internal market and will play a key role in helping to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Indeed, the new regulation will enable European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity and safety for their products and services more quickly, using a technically updated, flexible and effective system. This will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, enabling them to reduce production costs and administrative burdens, and raising their profiles in the single European market. That said, we will need to continue encouraging voluntary consultations between industry, public authorities and other stakeholders, so as to ensure that the development of standards and regulations is transparent and can be updated over time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate the Danish Presidency on its excellent work and on the significant results achieved in the context of the European Semester. In particular, I offer my congratulations on its excellent negotiating skills which helped, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, to end the vulgar and absurd diatribe concerning the location of the European patent court. As rapporteur, I agreed, with regret, to postpone the final vote following the Council’s unilateral proposal to amend the proposal for a regulation, but I must point out that this way of operating is unacceptable. It seriously undermines the constitutional balance of the EU, especially in an area and a measure that are fundamental to boosting economic growth in the European Union in key sectors such as innovation. This is a measure in which Parliament took a programmatic, constructive approach. I would therefore like to express my deep bitterness over what happened and call on the Council of Ministers, represented by the Cypriot Presidency that has now taken over, to find a solution with regard to the substance and the procedure as soon as possible. It will not be Parliament that causes a project that we have been working towards for over 30 years to fail, nor shall this Parliament allow the rules governing interinstitutional relations to be unilaterally modified by any institution. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, company law can act as a lever for developing the internal market. In difficult times like these, we now need to work together to find acceptable solutions that can be implemented rapidly. I shall therefore be very clear, Commissioner, as to what this Parliament expects in the coming months; you have already noted certain requirements in your speech. First of all, we hope for a pragmatic and flexible approach to make the legislation clearer and more accessible. To that end, even though a single instrument would offer significant benefits, the directives could alternatively be grouped by sector: for example, by the principles of function, mobility and forms of law. The other priority is to place European company law at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that over 90% of European businesses are SMEs, the internal market needs to be the natural environment for them to operate in, not merely a potential option. Lately, Parliament has been waiting, with some impatience, for a legislative proposal to set out the measures to facilitate companies’ cross-border mobility. That is all I shall say, because this subject is so huge that it is hard to cover it all in just over a minute. Nevertheless, I believe that there will be no shortage of opportunities for useful discussions. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report which, at the end of the European Year of Volunteering, concretely sets out its objectives and strategies. I fully agree with the aim of increasing the importance of volunteering and promoting cross-border regulation at EU level. Cross-border volunteering is an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth, contributing to the development of an economically and ecologically sustainable social conscience. To this end, I consider three initiatives proposed in the report to be key: the establishment of a centralised portal on volunteering, the creation of a European Humanitarian Aid Corps and the development of a European Skills Passport. I hope, finally, that there will continue to be a strong common will to invest in an area of such importance that promotes the development of common values and helps the integration process.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully supported the report by Mr Kalfin, whom I thank for the excellent quality of the work he has done, and agreed with the report’s contents. The Internet is a critical infrastructure. Online attacks can cause serious consequences and safety risks for both businesses and private households. For this reason, I agree on the urgency, highlighted in the report, to develop a reactive, flexible framework to prevent cyber attacks. Since virtuality does not have boundaries, it will be necessary to improve international cooperation and regulations in order to make future strategies effective. In this respect, the European External Action Service (EEAS) can and must play a key role in starting a constructive dialogue with third countries, including, where possible, issues regarding Internet security in the scope of its external relations. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported the report by Ms Herczog, who correctly detects the need for a coherent approach to improve regulatory convergence with neighbouring countries. The fact that Europe is a major purchaser of energy on global markets can, in fact, be seen as a weakness. On the other hand, the fact that we are also the biggest importer could be one of our strengths, if only the EU countries were to take a common negotiating position with third countries. I therefore support the approach proposed by our colleague, in particular, with regard to the three objectives underlying the whole strategy; namely, improvement and coordination at EU level, especially in strategic sectors such as research and innovation, the need for increased diversification of energy sources and, finally, the development of sustainable common policies on a global scale.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Ms Borsellino’s report, which addresses the need for a cross-party, multidisciplinary approach to security. I especially agree with her emphasis on establishing the key areas of the strategy, including the fight against terrorism and organised crime. I do not, however, believe it appropriate to adopt measures to protect intellectual property rights, in that this matter is already the subject of in-depth ongoing debate. That said, it will be essential to enhance EU judicial and police cooperation through Europol and Eurojust, via a proper implementation of the strategy. At the same time, proper and consistent legal instruments will need to be developed to facilitate the investigative process and the use of evidence. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, I welcome Mr de Jong’s report, which seeks to clarify the extension of the new European area of freedom, security and justice in criminal matters. The discussions under way in the Council are proceeding steadily, with two opposing positions: those who warmly welcome developments and those who are cautious about the emergence of an EU criminal law. The operational proposals that Parliament has advanced in response to the Council’s views are on the right track, namely, towards a careful examination of the need for, and the consequences of, adopting EU-wide legislation in this sector. I therefore fully support the request for additional resources to strengthen Parliament’s Legal Service to enable the proposals to be evaluated systematically and in depth. At the same time, in my view, it is essential to promote greater coordination between the institutions on this matter, in order to ensure that future initiatives are based on broad consensus and on Member States’ criminal justice policy requirements.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the priorities and the points Mr Busuttil has stressed in his report. I hope this House will adopt the report by an overwhelming majority so as to further enhance the operation of the single market, which is an absolutely vital part of the policies for EU development. That would send out a strong signal to the individual Member States. The latest results from the internal market scoreboard have shown how Member States are increasingly failing to deliver on the transposition of European legislation. That is why I agree with my fellow Member that we need to increase the power and flexibility of infringement proceedings, while rethinking the role SOLVIT should play as an alternative to seeking legal redress. In that respect, I share his reservations about the danger that we might run into problems with the principle of subsidiarity if the legal basis for SOLVIT is over-formalised. I therefore think the Commission needs to examine all kinds of solutions very carefully so as to make the portal more operational without running the risk of getting bogged down in legal technicalities. Lastly, we must bear in mind the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has redefined Parliament’s role considerably by giving it substantial powers to structure and review EU legislation. In that regard, the conclusions of the scoreboard need to be properly examined within this Parliament’s regular dialogue with the national parliaments, with a view to a more fruitful collaboration with the national authorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Ms Wikström on her work, the excellent quality of the report she has produced, and the compromises she has reached. The purpose of this report is to plug what is, unfortunately, a serious and glaring gap in Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 (Rome II), which emerged due to the lack of an agreement on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. This has arisen, in particular, due to the considerable impact of accessibility via the Internet to content that is published and distributed on a massive scale on blogs and social networks. It is therefore a necessary step to facilitate access to justice, ensure the internal market functions properly and deliver an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the right to privacy. I therefore fully endorse the urgency in adapting Rome II highlighted by the report, and I am particularly pleased with the proposal to create a centre for the voluntary settlement of cross-border disputes arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. Considering the high costs of judicial settlement, an alternative voluntary dispute settlement system, which would, of course, be less costly, could meet two needs. It could protect individual rights and personal image, while at the same time ensuring freedom of opinion. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated Ms Hübner’s report, which offers a useful way to stop essential resources for countries in crisis being decommitted. This is a regulation of fundamental importance which, without making any changes to the European Union’s budget, will provide an alternative to the risk of losing funds already assigned under the cohesion policy to Member States involved in a financial assistance programme that have problems with cofinancing. I especially agree with the precise definition of the instrument’s ceiling and the policy decision to favour projects that have generated revenues and those that could contribute to achieving the Member State’s strategic goals in order to improve its chances of economic recovery. I believe that this measure will contribute to balancing the need for investment in development and growth with the excessively-revered austerity solution to the sovereign debt problem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the agreement addressing the need to strengthen transatlantic cooperation in fighting terrorism after the 11 September attacks. I do not share the intransigent position taken by the rapporteur who, despite the positive opinion of the Commission Legal Service and of the Data Protection Working Party, has continued to assert that the agreement was unnecessary and disproportionate. I am aware of the limits of this agreement and of the room for improvement; nonetheless I believe that its requirements in terms of data protection have greatly improved. The agreement obliges the US authorities to share their data analysis with the judicial authorities of the European Union, explaining in detail its permitted use, namely the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. I therefore believe that it would be unnecessary and detrimental to start new negotiations, at the risk of a rejection of the agreement which might deprive Europe of any law in this field.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this report, through which Parliament is trying to send out an important message on simplifying and harmonising corporate taxation. The existence of 27 different legislations on corporate income tax does not only mean high costs and red tape for businesses operating in different countries, but also the serious risk of tax evasion and tax discrimination. This intervention is essential to reduce the costs for businesses operating in several states and to promote economic growth and economic recovery within the internal market. Finally, the optional nature of this measure, which gives companies the possibility to assess the benefits and costs when choosing the new system, neutralises the reluctance of some Member States that fear their sovereignty in taxation and revenue may be at risk. In the interests of citizens and businesses rather than solely on the basis of calculations of national self-interest, I therefore hope that the Council will be able to reach an agreement without resorting to enhanced cooperation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Berlinguer, whom I congratulate on the work and the excellent analysis he carried out. The report fully highlights the problems and shortcomings that are obstructing the effective development of the European Higher Education Area. In particular, I am referring to the inadequate relationship between universities and the world of work, to the still unfinished revision of the national systems of quality assurance and to unfair access to university educational systems. Therefore, I share my fellow Member’s calls for the adoption of a common system of quality assurance in order to establish mutual recognition of university qualifications. At the same time, I hope that the next ministerial conference, scheduled to take place in April, will address the sore point of the issue: the need and urgency to move quickly in the process of revising the directives on professional qualifications and their recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are almost 450 000 international successions opened each year in the European Union, for a total value, as has already been said, of over EUR 120 billion. Nonetheless, there are still numerous difficulties for citizens to face to establish which State, and which authorities shall have jurisdiction in matters of succession. To that we should add that most Member States do not allow the citizen to choose the jurisdiction applicable at the time of succession. There are also numerous questions arising regarding the judicial recognition of official notarial acts in a Member State other than the one where they were drawn up. These serious shortcomings, these tangible needs on the part of European citizens, are addressed by the regulation which we are about to adopt, and in doing so, ladies and gentlemen, we are not approving a classic piece of legislation, but rather we are creating an instrument to regulate a crucial aspect of institutional organisation within every society: indeed, the concepts of inheritance and succession as well as the rules governing its effects and individual details have huge repercussions for the organisation of any society. For that reason, I would like to sincerely thank everyone who contributed to this challenging project and in particular Mr Lechner for his work and for his efforts during the difficult legislative process that is now coming to its conclusion. I thank him first and foremost on behalf of those millions of European citizens who will benefit from a tool that fully meets their needs and makes a substantial contribution to the process of European integration.

Your reply at the time maintained that you had written to all the Member States and were waiting for the relevant confirmations. My questions are as follows: what stage have we reached?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo on the work he has done, which recognises the key role played by the defence of intellectual property rights as an indispensable instrument for economic growth in the European Union, in that it creates jobs and protects cultural diversity. Infringements of intellectual property rights effectively do enormous damage to Union revenues and it is essential to strengthen our efforts to combat unlawful acts through collaboration between national authorities, European Union institutions and industry experts. The adoption of this measure answers this need and enables us to lay the foundation for creating a single market for intellectual property rights. Embedding the Observatory within the European Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will in fact ensure that it has the human, financial and logistical resources it needs in order to carry out its task in an effective manner. We are at the start of a long journey, during which we shall have to monitor and evaluate the Observatory’s activities with close and careful attention. Infringement of intellectual property rights in fact occurs on many levels, requiring different degrees of protection and recognition by Member States. It will be essential to continue to make use of the expertise of national authorities and the many specific representative organisations. This will enable us to strengthen the technical skills of the Observatory, thereby simultaneously ensuring that every intellectual property right is recognised at the EU level without any hierarchical ordering of the level of protection and recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Lechner on the excellent work he has done, which clears the way for a measure that specifically meets the needs of business, particularly of small businesses, and contributes to the process of completing the internal market. The interconnection of national companies registers is of fundamental assistance to firms wishing to open a branch in another Member State or simply do business with enterprises in other states. As well as increasing consumer and user confidence in cross-border transactions, this interconnection will result in saving businesses a potential EUR 69 billion of costs every year. What is more, this measure will increase legal certainty, which will help to solve one of the problems businesses face most often in their cross-border activities. Notwithstanding that the interconnection is of a purely technical nature, and will not therefore also extend to the legal consequences arising from the use of registers, the transparency and the reliability of the information that this will be able to provide and guarantee form the basis on which consumers and information users can exercise and defend their rights. In conclusion, I should point out that a special feature of this measure is that questions of a technical nature cannot be answered exhaustively. In other words, problems and the relevant solutions will arise and have to be developed in the course of the creation of the network. For this reason, the interconnection process will succeed only if, as I hope, the Commission and the Member States work together closely. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of this directive, which implements measures needed to protect the lives and freedoms of the victims of crime. To give an example: according to some estimates, there are about 100 000 women in Europe who benefit from protection orders. Such measures, however, are currently limited in their effect to the territory where they were adopted or in which the victims live. As a result, there is a legislative gap that this directive fills through the mutual recognition of protection orders in the context of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The instrument to be introduced shortly will, in fact, ensure that a protection order issued in one country will automatically be recognised in any Member State that the victim visits. This is an extremely important result, which, in practical terms, helps to create a European Union area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for in the Treaty. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted for Ms Mathieu’s report since I strongly believe that immigration in Europe is a great opportunity, but that it must be managed intelligently and fairly. Without effective intervention, the labour market would be divided and a host of low-cost workers would threaten to undermine the achievements of the European social model. I therefore think this provision will help to prevent and control such a threat by creating a level playing field for the citizens of our countries and for third-country nationals; I am referring, for example, to access to the various kinds of advisory services that the host country makes available. Similarly, I am pleased with the compromises reached on access to education and training and on the portability and transferability of pensions and acquired pension rights, which will no longer depend on whether or not there are bilateral agreements between countries.

It is, in fact, superfluous and disproportionate to subject micro-enterprises that trade only locally or, at most, regionally to the same financial reporting requirements as large companies. Unfortunately, because of a blocking minority comprising a few Member States, the Council wants another two years to approve this measure. I sincerely hope that the Council will stop taking this attitude and we will not always need a crisis to occur for good proposals to be put into effect, when it comes to making life easier for small enterprises, which are a major engine for growth in Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though all EU Member States should respect people’s right to a fair trial, national procedures on information in criminal proceedings vary considerably from one country to another. Some Member States provide for accused persons to receive only oral information about their procedural rights, while others provide information – especially if it is technical – only in writing or at the request of the accused. Since over 8 million criminal proceedings are brought in the European Union every year, it is easy to see that an information system that is still so varied and heterogeneous is inadequate. I therefore agree with the content and aims of this directive. I am referring especially to the general rule making it compulsory to provide accused persons with information about their procedural rights before proceedings begin, particularly the right to be assisted by a lawyer and to be able to benefit from official translations if the proceedings are in a different language. With regard to the stage after proceedings have begun, I agree with the two specific rights selected: the right of accused people to full information about the charges brought against them, and their right to access to the case file. These are two essential conditions for determining and challenging the lawfulness of the arrest or detention and for enabling them to put up the best possible defence. I therefore congratulate the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on their work during the informal trialogues. These have led to the approval of measures that will harmonise the spread and development of fundamental rights, such as the right to a defence and the right to a fair trial.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of promoting a European identity and improving knowledge of our shared history – especially among young people – is of crucial importance, especially at a historical and political juncture like the present. To work towards achieving this goal I voted in favour of the report by Ms Paliadeli, in which I completely agree on the criteria for identifying the sites, which I think should take place transnationally and on a two-yearly basis, thereby boosting the quality of the process. Lastly, I fully agree with the role given to Parliament, which will be duly involved in the process of selecting the chosen sites. For one thing, Parliament has always supported the development of this label, firstly in the 2007 tourism resolution and then in the 2008 resolution on the European agenda for culture in a globalised world.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the complexity of the process of recognition, which affects an extremely high number of professions, is an obstacle to the circulation of European professionals and has negative effects on growth and competition. Therefore, I share Ms McClarkin’s view which aims to streamline administrative processes by creating registration systems and an online portal containing all the relevant information regarding procedures. I believe that the proposal to extend the Internal Market Information system to professions not yet open to the directive on services is valid and necessary. Finally, I hope for further development of the debate towards other and wider categories of professionals. I refer, in particular, to professions close to the world of business, which currently raises an often unnecessary barrier against cross-border exchanges, as in the case of legal and accounting professions. o o o Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Simon’s report since I fully agree with the urgency to bring more clarity and directness to the application of rules on State aid to services of general economic interest. In particular, I believe that there is widespread agreement on the urgency to draw up de minimis
 measures for services of general interest which do not substantially affect commerce between Member States. Having said this, I have some reservations on the approach chosen by the Commission. In fact, I believe that the excessive quantity of texts, between communications, decision and regulation, runs the risk of confusing the normative framework and of making it appear confused and difficult to understand rather than contributing to a genuine and functional updating of existing rules as required.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over 80 million people in Europe are threatened by poverty. The economic crisis has aggravated this situation, leaving the weakest fringes of society exposed. I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Daerden’s report; I particularly appreciated its comprehensiveness and the number of issues raised, making for an effective fight against poverty. I refer specifically to the close examination of cooperation between states, to the definition of common principles to establish the so-called ‘basket’ of goods and services that are essential and accessible to all, and to the fight against child poverty. In the same way, I agree with the lines of action drawn up by the Commission, in particular, the priority of better use of Structural Funds, which could play an essential role in the development of innovative approaches and of specific programmes in the fight against poverty. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, in the field of innovation, European small and medium-sized enterprises are still suffering from slower growth than their counterparts in the United States and in other emerging economies. In this context, unitary patent protection can provide an excellent opportunity to boost the role of SMEs in the area of innovation and research, and contribute to the relaunch of the internal market at the same time. Therefore, I would like to ask whether you intend to propose, in the medium or short term, specific measures to facilitate the access of SMEs to the European patent market – for example, a European fund with the responsibility and power to pay registration fees on behalf of SMEs – and whether you believe that the legislative procedure under way can help and offers a good opportunity to attain this objective.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) in civil, commercial and family matters is a valid alternative to the traditional confrontational approach between parties, offering an effective, inexpensive solution to disputes. I therefore support Ms Wallis’s horizontal approach, which extends the benefits of ADR to business-to-business civil and commercial transactions and to family disputes. That said, I hope that the Commission’s forthcoming legislative proposal will satisfy the key points highlighted by this Parliament: above all, the need to ensure a high level of impartiality and transparency of the systems, the application of ADR to electronic commerce by means of an online multilingual platform, and the promotion of ADR as a valid, cost-effective alternative to forms of collective redress.

 Mr President, public procurement can play a decisive role for the EU budget: indeed, public expenditure on works, goods and services accounts for roughly 17% of EU GDP and almost a fifth of this expenditure – approximately EUR 420 billion – falls within the scope of the EU directives on public procurement. I would therefore congratulate Ms Rühle for setting out what I believe to be the red lines of the forthcoming reform of the directive on public procurement: in particular, I am referring to the criterion of lowest price, which can no longer be the determining one for the award of contracts and should be replaced by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender in terms of economic, social and environmental benefits. Similarly, I agree entirely with the urgent need to simplify the rules in order to make procurement procedures simpler, less cumbersome and more in line with the needs of SMEs and small contracting authorities. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis has shown that the Stability and Growth Pact is not working as it should. Six Member States, three of which are in the euro area, are having budgetary problems and risk defaulting on their debt. This is a situation that we must urgently put an end to. It is important, however, that this be done in a way that is sustainable and with a view to the future. That is why I voted in favour of the Goulard report, whose approach of using sanctions I approve of, particularly with respect to manipulation of financial data, falsified statistics or misleading information on the part of a Member State. At the same time, however, future efforts must be directed at what is the heart of the problem, namely the insufficient degree of economic integration within the European Union. Sanctions will have a merely cursory dissuasive effect if we do not reinforce the bonds forged by single economic policies by increasing the number of surveillance missions by the Commission, and in the medium term, the use of Eurobonds. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having regular access to up-to-date and reliable budgetary data is the key to regulating public spending and enabling the swift adoption of corrective measures in times of crisis. I therefore agree on the need to allow the Commission to monitor, with the help of a fiscal body, individual Member States’ compliance with budgetary rules. Having said that, I must point out that, under the Treaty, the establishment of a medium-term financial framework leaves the way clear for newly elected governments to amend the programming decisions that were previously taken. This directive must therefore be applied to the letter, and the Commission must constantly monitor its application. This is to ensure that intervention has a tangible rather than superficial effect and that it helps to achieve the directive’s primary objective: uniform compliance with budgetary discipline as stipulated by the Treaty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Thursday evening, the Bundestag
 will vote on the agreement of 21 July, while in the very near future, we expect to receive the Troika’s report on the situation in Greece. Essentially, Mr Juncker, a number of economists are accusing us, together with European leaders and European institutions, of wasting precious time in saving the euro. We have reached a crossroads for Europe and for our currency. In this light, what can we expect from the meeting of the Eurogroup Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 3 October? Do you believe that a solution is possible? If so, which solution and with what kind of political support? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union continues to move forward at too slow a pace in the area of science, and is not catching up with the United States and Japan, who are the leaders in this field. On average the 27 Member States invest 2% of GDP in research and development, rather than respecting the 3% target set by the Commission. As a result the publication of the Green Paper by the European Commission seems even more opportune, as it enables us to actively revive the discussion, as described by the excellent report by Ms Matias. I second the request made by the rapporteur concerning the establishment of an all-European common fund to promote collaborative research in the European Union and reduce inequality among Member States. At the same time I believe it is essential that any measure is preceded by a doubling of the research and innovation programme budget for the financing period from 2014. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the successful implementation of Directive 2008/52/EC shows that mediation is a viable alternative to the traditional adversarial approach, in that it allows for the amicable settlement of disputes and thus reduces the workload of the courts. This is confirmed by the various initiatives taken by some Member States, which are encouraging, where possible, the use of mediation through financial incentives or legislative provisions. In view of that, I should like to draw attention to certain aspects that I believe deserve further thought and consideration, starting with the issue of costs: we should follow the example of Member States that have tackled this problem by providing financial incentives to use mediation. I also believe that we need to explore other possibilities, such as the use of awareness campaigns to promote the use and understanding of alternative forms of dispute resolution, especially on the part of businesses. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary also, and above all, to involve members of the legal system, who must see the added value of mediation as something that enhances, rather than competes with, their work. Lastly, looking ahead to the forthcoming Commission communication on the implementation of the directive and, in particular, to the imminent legislative proposal on alternative dispute resolution, I should like to emphasise the way in which mediation complements other reforms of EU law, in particular, the approach to forms of collective redress and to contract law. Indeed, as a preliminary measure, mediation can be an excellent alternative to forms of collective redress and can make an important contribution to the future instrument on contract law, significantly reducing the use of dispute resolution mechanisms.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work, which offers some interesting points of departure for increasing the quality and effectiveness of European legislative activity. I shall restrict myself to highlighting a number of aspects which I think are especially significant: it is absolutely essential to achieve a 25% cut in red tape, which can only be achieved through greater collaboration between the Commission and the Member States on measures designed to avoid diverging interpretations and the resulting ‘gold-plating’ of transposed legislation. With the same objective in mind, we need to ensure high quality correlation tables between directives and national transposition measures and we need to carry out retrospective assessments of the legislation implemented on a more frequent basis. These are essential measures for ensuring that EU legislation achieves its primary goal, which is meeting the expectations of EU citizens, the businesses operating on the single market, and national and local governments. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, a little less than a year ago, Parliament adopted the new directive to combat late payments. This was a vital recast which, by imposing firm deadlines on payments made by public administrations, satisfies the requests made by businesses and citizens and amounts to a formidable counter-cyclical measure that will also combat unemployment, which is laying waste to our countries. I would point out in this regard that one in four businesses fail due to late payments by public administrations, with the resulting loss of many jobs. Member States must transpose this new legislation not later than 16 March 2013. I would therefore like to ask Mr Tajani what measures the Commission is taking to ensure proper transposition of the directive into the various national legal systems and to facilitate the early entry into force of the directive, as promised by a number of Member States? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her work and the contents of her report, with which I am in complete agreement. I believe that only an optional instrument to be adopted by means of a regulation can adequately fulfil the objectives of the whole reform of European contract law. Moreover, an optional instrument should neither harmonise nor replace national contract laws but rather work alongside them as an alternative instrument that offers freedom of choice to contracting parties. Therefore, I do not agree with the proposals put forward by those who would prefer to limit the scope of this instrument so that it applies only to e-commerce contracts, as this would create an artificial and, above all, unnecessary distinction between online and face to face transactions. Our task as legislators is not to limit the legal nature of the regulation on the basis of speculation or market projections but rather to ensure legal certainty and to lay the foundations for a common legal language in the field of commerce. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 One necessary component of effective enforcement of judgments is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor’s assets and to freeze them. Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market. That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system, by which I mean an additional, autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts. This preventive measure will also provide a further deterrent against payment delays and will force the disclosure of assets in cross-border claims. Raffaele Baldassare,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Single Market Act lies in its desire to satisfy the needs of the market, facilitating access and participation of all those involved: businesses, consumers and workers. Given this ambitious goal, I am satisfied with the interventions proposed by Mr Barnier and the indications provided by this Parliament. In my opinion, some priorities are imperative for achieving the objectives that the EU has proposed, in particular: improving the access of small and medium-sized enterprises in the domestic market, reducing their administrative obligations and facilitating their participation in contract bidding procedures, removing all obstacles to the development of electronic commerce, and supporting and financing innovation, particularly through the issuance of bonds for European Union projects, especially in energy, transport and telecommunications. Finally, only by connecting development and support for the business world with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy regarding employment can we achieve what I believe to be the aim of this act, namely, to create a social market economy based on growth, competitiveness and sustainability.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your speech and the list of measures announced, and will not enter into the legal and regulatory debate on temporary protection of migrants and the application of Article 80 of the Treaty. As we speak, unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast, their passengers often paying with their lives. Despite the recent transfers, Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria. Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people, while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations. Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow, but we cannot continue to go it alone. We need the European Union, we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration, starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Schwab on the work he has done so far and the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Providing for varying degrees of harmonisation of standards will allow us to achieve important results, which will provide real added value for European citizens. Significant among these are the fourteen-day right of withdrawal and the new rules on information requirements, not only on price but also on the identity and address of the seller. These improvements will increase consumer confidence, especially in cross-border shopping by providing the legal certainties essential for the development of e
-commerce. This directive will also lay the foundation for other complementary measures, from the reform of European contract law to the process of reviewing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This fundamental harmonisation action is an essential condition for the development of an internal market focused on the rights of its consumers and serving the citizens of the European Union. About a year ago, Professor Monti said in his report to President Barroso: ‘Consumers and consumer welfare should be at the centre of the next stage of the single market’. First, the law-maker should reach early agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, to ensure a high level of protection in an integrated retail market. This provision fully meets the demands, and I am convinced that Mr Schwab will maintain the necessary determination in the complex negotiations that will follow before the final adoption of the text.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report and I should like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Járóka for the work she has done. She managed to bring together the different positions and establish clear objectives and priorities for the strategy; namely, the provision of specific measures against nomadic lifestyles, guarantees on basic healthcare, equal access to primary, secondary and higher education, and the right to housing. The strategy actually aims at inclusion and not merely integration. It is obvious that the role of the Commission and local authorities will be crucial, above all, in terms of controlling and managing European Union funds. The only limitation of this report is the lack of instruments to check the actual desire for integration amongst some Roma communities and the consequences that are likely to stem from any unwillingness to remain on the territory of a Member State or participate in the treatments, and the aid and welfare programmes, which certainly cannot continue ad infinitum
 without producing results. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although some excellent results have been achieved so far on the road towards European integration, there remain some gaps in fundamental areas for the development of a democratic system and full confirmation of the rule of law. Despite the progress made with the amendments to the legislation on criminal procedures and other primary laws, some aspects are still substantially behind schedule. I refer, in particular, to the urgent need to ensure the responsibility and efficiency of the judiciary, as well as its transparency, not to mention that of the public prosecutor’s office, and their independence from political interference. To that end, substantial changes are needed to the system for appointing judges and public prosecutors, putting an end to the practice whereby their appointments only take place in parliament and within the government. Lastly, (...) to improve access to justice and to free legal assistance. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 The market in services represents two thirds of the gross domestic product and two thirds of jobs in the European Union, but even so, only a fifth of total intra-EU trade. All the same, I can only agree with the priorities enumerated by the rapporteur and, in particular, as regards the completion of the points of single contact and the strengthening of administrative cooperation. As things stand, the first generation of points of single contact exists in 22 Member States. This would appear to afford us some comfort, were it not for the fact that in only 14 of them is it possible to complete the process online. On the contrary, it is essential that points of single contact become an integral part of greater e-government in the EU, making the offering available in different languages. Finally, it is essential to strengthen administrative cooperation so that the whole of this communication-based system can function efficiently. The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has already become a vitally important tool. It supports the work done by administrations, enables different administrative methods to be coordinated and deficient information to be supplemented. In spite of this, monitoring will, in future, be necessary to make sure that this system is not only used but also, and above all, correctly applied. Raffaele Baldassarre,

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with exceptional speed and dynamism, this Parliament is about to consent to the first instance of enhanced cooperation that specifically concerns the internal market. The accepted justification for this is that the discussion on a European patent has been on the agenda for many years. We should therefore do well to specify that the draft regulation on the translation regime was not adopted by the Commission until 30 June 2010 and that the Council took note of the lack of unanimity and the difficulty of reaching a unanimous decision in the near future in November 2010. I shall gloss over, then, the pace at which we in Parliament have dealt with the dossier, which I hope will serve as an example for the future, because we have broken records of some significance in favour of a speedy and efficient legislative passage. Nevertheless, since it is not my intention to act solely as a spokesman for the interests of my country, which is currently opposed to enhanced cooperation, and since I believe that the subject of the patent is fundamental to the development of industry and the European entrepreneurial system, I should like merely to raise certain questions that I consider to be important for the exercise by this House of its legislative functions and for the future treatment of regulations on the patent. First and foremost, we should do well to recognise that a vote in favour of enhanced cooperation will systematically legitimise the application to the development of the internal market of an instrument that should instead have the quality of a last resort. We are therefore creating a precedent that could be used in all areas of the internal market. Furthermore, I believe that this Parliament can, when we are faced with other subjects, subsequently state its view in a manner that is exhaustive and autonomous, and that individual proposals are at the centre of users’ and businesses’ interests rather than those of individual groups of countries. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am pleased to have had a Presidency that has proved able to manage the European agenda in a pragmatic and effective way, albeit at a difficult time. From the adoption at first reading of the recast of the directive on combating late payment in public administration, which is fundamental to the future of the system of undertakings, to the adoption of the financial supervision package, the Belgian Presidency has proved to be both practical and dynamic. I could cite other examples, but I prefer to draw conclusions about what can be learnt from a Presidency that has concluded its term of office in a positive way. Firstly, one has to have a realistic work programme; secondly, one has to be able to negotiate dynamically and reach compromises; and, lastly, one has to fully involve the European institutions, starting with Parliament, and take an approach to outstanding issues that is free from constraints and national interests. I hope that this Presidency will serve as an example to the others that follow it. For now though, I offer it my most sincere congratulations. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend for my speech to deny the seriousness of a situation that is the inevitable outcome of obvious administrative and political failings, which have been – and still are – in danger of burying an entire city and its surroundings in waste. Mr Søndergaard and Mrs Lichtenberger, the crisis in Campania initially began and then developed so dramatically because of the inability of a regional council and a left-wing Naples city council, together with aldermen from the Greens, to take decisions – including unpopular and brave decisions – to create an environmentally friendly waste collection and disposal system. Irresponsibility, indecision, political gain, sinister collusion and waste characterised a political and administrative phase that is now definitively over. I want to reassure those who tabled the oral questions and the political groups that supported them that the political situation is viable and has completely changed. The national government and the new regional council have shouldered their responsibilities and have the political determination to resolve the crisis. Through a dialogue with the populations concerned and with the necessary resolve, they are overcoming obstacles and objections that are often caused by Nimby Syndrome, or the idea that people do not want others’ rubbish in their backyard. As a result, they have drawn up an integrated waste collection and disposal plan that will shortly provide incentives for separate collection and the construction of the necessary facilities. It would therefore be extremely unfair, counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting: imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union, which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs. This contradiction reveals some people’s genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested. The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union. The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption. On the one hand, this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature. However, on the other hand, the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes. The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and, naturally, the political approach is changing. The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union. This is the basis of today’s debate and the oral question submitted, which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament, and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown. Allow me to recall Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who said: ‘All grown-ups were children once – although few of them remember it’. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating a European identity and increasing citizens’ interest in the European Union and its origins are two challenges that the European institutions must face up to in order to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity. Furthermore, these challenges are at the heart of the goals of the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, Article 3 of the Treaty establishes the EU’s obligation to safeguard European cultural development. If the European dream is going through a difficult phase at the moment, this is not only down to the impasse
 regarding Europe as a political project, or the ongoing economic crisis, but is also due to the difficulties faced by a Union founded on an as yet unresolved identity. In this situation, it is more necessary than ever to reduce the gap between the European Union and its citizens, bringing the multinational yet shared cultural heritage of the European Union to its citizens and, above all, to future generations. This is the meaning and importance of a European Heritage Label: to bring Europe together in its diversity, promoting a shared culture and favouring integration between the places involved within its territory. In order to realise this objective, the new label will focus on the symbolic educational value rather than on the aesthetic beauty of a site, favouring cooperation between sites and supporting joint projects amongst them. I should therefore like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mrs Paliadeli and the rest of the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular, with regard to the procedure for selecting the sites and strengthening the role of the European Parliament during the selection process. I am sure that the Member States’ decision to insert the label within the framework of the European Union will contribute to increasing its visibility and prestige, so as to realise the objectives of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on Mr Szájer’s report tomorrow, we will give the go-ahead for one of the new instruments – on implementing acts – contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. This will simplify the old comitology system. It is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts, regulating methods of control by Member States over the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission. The fundamental importance of the Regulation has made the legislative procedure complicated both at inter-institutional level and within Parliament where, however, because of the involvement – albeit belated – of all committees, I hope it will be possible to adopt the proposal at first reading. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for succeeding in achieving the priority objectives for the European Parliament: I refer to the guarantees to align the current comitology procedures with the new procedure, the right to scrutiny by Parliament and the Council, the creation of an appeal committee chaired by the Commission and the inclusion of a review clause that will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the procedure. Allow me a final comment on what was the last obstacle to the negotiations: the inclusion of the common commercial policy within the scope of the future Regulation. Although the final agreement will allow the application of a simple majority voting system for the adoption of anti-dumping measures during a transitional period of 18 months, subsequently the measures will be adopted by qualified majority. This solution was the outcome of a difficult compromise but I am convinced that it satisfies both the needs of industry and the European Union executive, removing decisions of a technical nature from the risk of dangerous politicisation.

 Mr President, after the adoption of the Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service, we are today called on to make that decision operational by amending the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations of Union officials. In that respect, I would like to focus on an aspect of the report that has involved us in difficult negotiations: the issue of geographical balance in the composition of the European diplomatic corps. Some Members would, in fact, have preferred different criteria for the selection of staff, based on country of origin and citizenship. Such proposals have been avoided by means of balanced compromise amendments, which have been able to take geographical and gender balance into account without imposing country-based selection criteria. The selection of country-based quotas would not, in fact, have been a suitable or desirable solution. After over 50 years of European integration, the Union’s first real diplomatic corps is now being created. It has to be put in a position to be able to develop a common foreign policy and serve the Union’s interests on the international stage. For it to accomplish this task, it is crucial that its staff represent the Union and not the Member States of which they are citizens or have been diplomatic officers. That is the line that the Committee on Legal Affairs took yesterday when adopting the Rapkay report, and that is the line that I hope will continue to be taken in the vote in plenary. Raffaele Baldassarre,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, Mrs Weiler, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased and proud to have contributed to the adoption of this directive on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is a vital counter-cyclical measure which provides very real support to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by laying down definite payment terms and appropriate penalties to encourage punctual payment by both public authorities and private enterprise in the European Union. If everyone involved paid their debts on time, the European economy would receive a cash injection worth EUR 300 billion. Our market will not be common and our competition will not be fair until uniform rules are established that apply to everybody. That is the motivation behind the new directive on combating late payment: it forces public authorities to be more efficient and virtuous in their actions and helps the internal market and free competition to develop homogeneously, to the benefit of SMEs. This House has been able to make a decisive contribution to this successful outcome by overcoming all kinds of pressure and divisions for the sake of the general good of the people and of the European production system.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg’s report highlights a fundamental question for the EU integration process: the need to make simple, clear laws that EU citizens can understand. I cannot fail to agree with the key objectives identified by the rapporteur, in particular respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the importance accorded to the impact assessments and to reducing administrative burdens. With regard to the impact assessments, I am keen to stress that the Committee on Legal Affairs is actively working so that the European Commission can develop mechanisms to provide guarantees and ensure the independence of the analyses carried out. This is a fundamental question: ensuring higher standards for the impartiality of the assessments would give the EU’s legislative proposals greater credibility, and would simplify the process for their adoption. Furthermore, I consider it vital to work towards a clear reduction of the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation. The European Commission would like to reduce these burdens by 25% by 2012, which would entail an increase in the level of EU GDP of 1.4%, equivalent to EUR 150 billion. A substantial part of EU administrative burdens stems, in fact, from the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of administrative procedures implemented at national level. To give an example: 72 EU legislative acts have imposed 486 information obligations, which have led to the adoption in the Member States of more than 10 000 implementing acts. While on the one hand, increased monitoring is required during the transposition of Union law, on the other, greater collaboration by the Council and the individual Member States is essential. To conclude, I think that, leaving aside matters concerning the principle of subsidiarity, closer cooperation with national parliaments can provide a decisive contribution towards making EU laws more effective and ultimately bringing them closer in line with the needs of EU citizens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new guidelines to promote employment constitute a fundamental step towards economic recovery and growth in Europe. The meltdown has triggered a significant rise in the unemployment rate. In 2010, this figure reached 9.6%, and 20.3% for youth unemployment; in other words, millions and millions of people are unemployed. Yet unemployment is only part of the problem. Indeed, the task is not simply to create new jobs but to improve and preserve the ones that already exist. To achieve the goals set out in the report, we also need a structural change in the economy. In this respect, despite the considerable efforts expended by the rapporteur, Mr Őry, Parliament’s response to the statistics I have just mentioned remains general and unfocused, and this is to the detriment of the European strategy. Indicators and key targets are not enough. It is not enough to use terms such as ‘coordinate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘collaborate’. A pact between generations is not enough. We need a European policy that meets the needs of its citizens. The limits imposed by budget policies must be overturned by more specific, development-oriented public planning. We must direct the actions we take today towards helping young people and future generations; we need training and education policies that allow for investment in human capital in order to improve its quality and to connect it to the labour market. We need to make choices that will help the production system. To sum up: we need less paperwork, more investment and clearer economic choices. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Interconnecting business registers is an essential prerequisite for promoting integration of the economic area within the EU and for improving legal certainty for businesses and consumers. Mr Lechner’s report picks out very clearly what are the priority measures that are indispensable for making the law more certain and for making cross-border economic transactions more transparent. Firstly, it is vital that interconnecting registers and access to data take place in a single framework. To this end, it will be necessary to strengthen and develop the potential offered by the BRITE interconnection project in order that a single portal can be established through which all our citizens can obtain information on European businesses. Secondly, it will be vital that it is adopted with a view to making integration of business registers compulsory for all Member States, so that all states take part as soon as possible. This is because the success of any project that aims to achieve a harmonious development of the internal market requires the participation of all interested parties so that it can be made compulsory as soon as the technical standards have been fully developed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Albania is a fundamental factor in the stability of the Western Balkans and in the EU enlargement process. The country is taking important steps to develop democracy, improve infrastructures and transition to an open and competitive economy. However, Albania’s path to the European Union is still blocked by the difficult stabilisation of the party system, due, in part, to the obstructive behaviour of the opposition, which has a negative impact on the development and approval of structural reforms. The economy is still being held back by an uncertain legal framework, widespread illegality, a large informal economy and inadequate energy and transport systems. Italy has played, and still plays, an important role in the stabilisation of Albania: Italy is its main trade partner, main investor and main benefactor – 430 000 Albanians live in Italy. However, these forms of collaboration need to be supported by European action, with cooperation on a macro-regional basis, such as Adriatic-Ionian cooperation, to help pave the way for Europe in the Mediterranean.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has confronted us with the evidence that greater coordination at European level is an absolute priority for the development and stability of the financial markets. That said, I shall limit myself here to highlighting one fundamental issue, particularly in the light of the difficult trialogues still ongoing. If giving financial oversight authorities the power to adopt individual, directly binding decisions – as provided for in Article 10 of the regulations – responds to the political desire to react quickly to emergency situations, then in the case of daily supervision, this power conflicts with Articles 17 and 258 of the treaty, which state that it is the exclusive power of the Commission to ensure the application of the law of the Union. Furthermore, in this case, a paradoxical situation would be created in which the Member States, present in the highest body through their own authorities, would be indirectly responsible for applying the law of the Union. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I proposed a compromise amendment which attempts to resolve this discrepancy between the powers conferred on the authorities and the role and competences of the Commission, in full compliance with the treaty. I hope that the contribution of the Legal Affairs Committee can be used as a basis for any further compromises with the other European institutions in order to arrive swiftly at a much needed solution, which is completely in accordance with the law of the Union.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers in the scope of the directive. This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules. By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules. Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition. Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost. It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks. In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers’ health and safety.

 The proposal for a draft Framework Decision establishes fundamental obligations based on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court case law. The right to interpretation and translation is essential for those who must defend themselves in a criminal trial and cannot speak the language of the proceeding. Moreover, under Article 6 of the Treaty, the Union respects the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which upholds the right to a fair trial. The text we are discussing today is a satisfactory and fully acceptable compromise. In the compromise solutions, the Presidency in fact safeguarded the essential points indicated by Member States with regard to costs arising from implementation of the directive and the transposition period. In the light of all this, I am pleased by the results achieved within the Council and European Parliament: interpretation must be offered in the mother tongue of the suspect or in a language known to the suspect, while translation will be offered only for the essential documents and the possibility of drawing up oral summaries of the main documents will be considered.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the creation of the Union and the holding of the summit of Heads of State or Government, we still lack a clear definition of EU Mediterranean policy and a long-term strategic vision for the development and stabilisation of the region. Yet the Mediterranean has enormous potential: one third of global maritime traffic now passes through Mediterranean waters, coming from China, Asia, European countries, India, reaching our waters via the Suez Canal. The coastal countries of the Middle East and of Africa are advanced developing countries and for us, they are vital in certain fundamental areas, including that of migration flows. We must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean, providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects. The key points include agriculture, transport, maritime highways, transnational corridors, renewable energy and the Solar Plan. In the words of Paul Morand, a French diplomat and writer, the Mediterranean is, above all, the anti-desert civilisation. Let us reassert these words. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last two years have left millions of unemployed people in their wake, have been the cause of further national debt that will remain for many years still, and have put renewed pressure on and new tears in our social cohesion. We must react in a timely and incisive manner, and, in order to avoid making the errors of judgment that the Lisbon Strategy succumbed to, Europe 2020 must be extremely realistic in its objectives and balanced in the goals it sets itself. Three of these seem to me, Commissioner, to be priorities. The first is certainly a stable currency and stable national budgets, which, however, must not be divorced from development and economic growth. We need investment in research and innovation to make our industries ever more competitive and our products of the highest quality. We must support SMEs and new industries, such as IT and sustainable energy and, of course, our infrastructure. Let us raise the overall level of education, yes, but chiefly we must mould training to the needs of the labour market and production. It is a paradox that businesses are still demanding specialisms that the market is in no position to offer. It is clear that every target should be related to the national context, but within the framework of a broader European strategy. I shall conclude by saying that the Greek crisis and the economic and employment crisis in the whole of Europe testify to the fact that in order to safeguard social cohesion, development and stable national budgets, we need strong and solid economic governance at the European level, to enable European institutions, including Parliament, to take effective and preventive action.

– Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Szájer for the outstanding work delivered in so little time. The delegated acts will be of paramount importance for Union law and the interinstitutional balance in the EU. Therefore, it is fundamental that they are developed and decided upon in a fully transparent manner which effectively enables the Parliament and the Council to democratically control the exercise of the power delegated to the Commission. To this extent, as advocated by the Szájer report, some issues will be of utmost importance and require our stronger commitment. These include, inter alia, the possibility for the European Parliament to revoke the delegation at any time and to make sure that Parliament and Council are conferred the same rights concerning their involvement in the process of delegation. Finally, I would like to stress that it should be a priority for the Commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis
 to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291, including the acquis
 in policy areas which, pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty, are now subject to the codecision procedure. Raffaele Baldassarre,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, needle-stick and other sharp injuries are among the most common risks faced by healthcare workers in Europe, and they therefore represent a serious problem both for the healthcare sector and for society in general. The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers’ Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions. The main aim of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or pointed objects used in medicine. This agreement therefore represents an important step towards an increase in safety within the hospital sector. As we all agree, the consequences of sharp injuries can be extremely serious and can cause the spread of diseases such as viral hepatitis and AIDS. That being said, I must stress the need for an integrated and, at the same time, realistic approach to this problem. In this respect I believe that the administrative, financial and legal constraints deriving from the agreement should not be excessive and therefore should not be such as to harm the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the healthcare sector, or else these enterprises could have serious difficulties in complying with the terms of the agreement. Just as commendable, moreover, is the anticipated – to ‘anticipated’ I would add ‘desirable’ – option for the Member States to adopt more effective provisions and measures than those contained in the agreement with the aim of protecting workers. Lastly, I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament, which often focuses on this issue, so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the microfinance facility for employment is part of a set of initiatives that have been adopted at European level, and it gives the unemployed an opportunity for a new start and opens the door to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including, of course, the young. The new facility should extend the range of targeted financial support to new entrepreneurs in the current context of a reduced credit supply. Individual entrepreneurs and founders of micro-enterprises will also be assisted by way of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building, in addition to interest-rate support from the European Social Fund. It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis. Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment. It is, however, necessary that the transfer of Progress funds remains unchanged, in the sense that we cannot give the signal to divert resources from the Progress programme. These resources need to be found from other sources and, above all, need to be associated with other European initiatives, so that we project a strong image and make a strong effort in favour of the unemployed in Europe.

The Treaty of Lisbon substantially changes the institutional balances that were originally outlined by the Treaty of Maastricht concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by including, though with substantial exceptions, the ordinary legislative procedure relating to the area of freedom, security and justice. It is therefore necessary for any amendment to the measures implementing the Europol decision to be adopted within the new legislative framework envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Europol cannot be strengthened unless Parliament is able to express itself properly on regulations relating to measures that are not purely technical but political, such as the transfer of personal data. Allow me to add a thought concerning the European Union’s increasingly outward-looking stance and the increased synergy between internal security and defence. Even if the treaty has no immediate effect on the development of security and defence markets, it paves the way for the development of a more integrated and consistent security market, which requires legislative actions that are coordinated and therefore interinstitutional. It would therefore be all the more inconsistent, if not indeed harmful, to adopt ‘political’ amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision that do not follow the legislative procedure envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both proposals fully transfer to the Commission the powers which, until now, have been held by the Council. With the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the consequent abolition of the pillar-based Community structure, the legal situation will be profoundly different and significantly modified. Therefore, the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent allocation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars. This is why I feel it is essential that the proposal provides for greater involvement of the Member States – I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that the involvement of experts is sufficient – and, above all, true involvement, true participation of the European Parliament within the coordinating group of the mechanism to monitor and verify the proper application of the Schengen acquis
. Furthermore, in my opinion, we should determine and better define, by means of more comprehensive, more precise criteria, how to use the migratory pressure parameter, which pinpoints the areas of greatest risk where unannounced visits should take place. Lastly, the proposals should be treated as a single package and not separately, since they both represent common aspects of the same issue and have the same shortcomings. This is also because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the applicable procedure will be codecision. I therefore fully support the position set out by Mr Coelho and the calls on the Commission to withdraw these proposals and submit other, better ones, which take into account what has come out of this debate.

‘Finning’, or the removal the fins of sharks on board vessels, with the remaining parts of the animal’s body being thrown into the sea, has been banned in the EU since 2003. In order to put an end to this practice, it should be made mandatory for sharks to be landed with their fins still naturally attached to their body. Many fishing boats in the Mediterranean Sea practice finning since the sought-after shortfin mako and blue shark are both common, although these species might soon be listed as threatened with extinction. Illegal fishing is on the rise in the Mediterranean, in part due to the high demand for shark fins and the prices that they command. This type of non-sustainable fishing causes serious damage to the marine ecosystem, especially in recent years in the Mediterranean, where there is evidence that a number of shark populations have been affected by the practice. Greater cooperation is required in order to combat this illegal practice on board fishing vessels. To this end, the Member States must step up controls both at sea and in port, preventing the bodies of sharks from being thrown into the sea. Finning must be made transparent, controlled and above all regulated, so that it can be considered a sustainable and non-invasive form of fishing. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Enlargement represents the future of the European Union in order to ensure cohesion and integration. The recent financial crisis has highlighted the interdependence of national economies, both within and beyond the EU. It is therefore important to consolidate relations, especially in the economic area, with candidate and potential candidate countries. It is essential to create a climate of harmony and conciliation between different nations and peoples, encouraging economic cultural and religious dialogue. The peaceful resolution of conflicts and the establishment of good neighbourly relations between European countries are essential to sustainable peace and stability and contribute substantially to a genuine European integration process. It is important to give adequate priority within enlargement policy to the building of an efficient, independent and impartial judicial system, effectively fighting corruption, money laundering and organised crime. Enlargement must remain a credible policy, based on democracy, human rights and reconciliation. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the ‘better law-making’ initiative we discussed back in September served as a basis for this second sympathetic report from the rapporteur. The Treaty of Lisbon has undoubtedly given Parliament additional powers at an important time for European integration. Nevertheless, law-making, in concrete terms, remains out of kilter with citizens’ expectations. All this clearly requires careful monitoring and increased cooperation, based on the confidence demonstrated by European institutions in individual Member States to guarantee the uniform and homogeneous application of EU law in all 27 Member States. Law-making must be clearly informed by clarity, transparency and coherence, with respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, but at the same time it needs to challenge the fact that some Member States are somewhat unwilling to support this integration process, which is particularly significant from a legislative perspective. We therefore need workable tools that facilitate the transposition process and allow further judicial cooperation, on the assumption that the infringement procedure is the symptom of a pathology that must be cured by force.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that better legislation is an ongoing goal both of Parliament and of the institutional bodies that contribute, through colegislative powers, to giving a sufficiently clear and orderly framework for the more than 500 million EU citizens that expect clear, accessible and consistent laws. Indeed, consistency is not just a political issue but must translate in real life into legislation that meets this fundamental requirement. It is important to highlight that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, this requirement is best met by close cooperation with national parliaments. We need appropriate criteria for assessing the correct application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and, above all, we need the will to work out whether eight weeks are enough time for Member States to give the opinion it is their right to express. Institutional websites providing information for citizens are helpful, but we also need greater engagement from local bodies and regional levels of government. Lastly, evidence-based policy making may be combined with impact assessments on the legislative process to measure its effectiveness. All of this contributes to building a properly simplified framework to avoid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing more costs than they do already and ensures that the gap between Brussels and Strasbourg, and between Member States and citizens, is reduced. A Europe of citizens with the EU institutions genuinely at their service is what Parliament must aim to make into a reality. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, the four reports that have been adopted today clearly demonstrate Parliament’s desire to make a decisive contribution to supporting the fisheries sector, which is currently beset by major difficulties. I voted in favour because I feel there is a vital need for coordinated action, just as I also believe that an approach involving regionalisation is absolutely essential in order to tailor this action to the needs of individual areas. We need to trim down the industry, expand market opportunities, enable fleets to modernise and ensure that there is real modernisation and growth in the sector, in which environmental sustainability must go hand in hand with economic profitability. We await the framework regulation and finally the implementing dossier on the funding for the further acceleration that we think is needed. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, I voted in favour of this dossier because I believe that the issue of energy efficiency, together with sustainability and competitiveness, can certainly be an essential instrument in a particularly difficult process, such as this one. We need sustainable growth that has to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and that can be used as a virtuous cycle, including through innovative green technology. All this must be achieved through a culture of design that makes the best use of these resources, channelling them towards building refurbishment, which, in particular, requires the full and appropriate use of EU cohesion funds. One third of buildings in Europe were built after 1973, which is clearly significant. It is possible to act within this context, including by means of better training and design that is consistent with the aims of the provision. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report because I consider financing infrastructure projects in the field of transport and energy to be of crucial importance in achieving the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as laid down by Europe 2020. As highlighted many times by the Commission and by Parliament, developing the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), trans-European energy network (TEN-E) and telecommunication infrastructures is part of the overall and necessary framework to relaunch EU employment and investment. Therefore, adequate support for financial resources guarantees the project will go ahead, and so acts as a catalyst for private investors, for whom uncertain risk perceptions and the ceaseless advance of the global economic crisis block the flow of finance. The construction of new modern and integrated infrastructures is fundamental if Europe is to remain a competitive, central player on the world stage and a leader in the post-crisis international economy. Building new infrastructures will create an enabling environment for a striving and competitive European private sector, stimulating growth, creating jobs for young people and engaging future generations in the relaunch of our economy, thus addressing some of the most pressing challenges our continent is facing today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for and have supported this measure, because I think it is in line with the overall strategy to develop a sector that is still really struggling and is affected by huge market volatility, environmental challenges and the need to ensure environmental safety. I would say that the limit on aid to individual farmers is right, that the incentives for greening to help these new processes develop and inject competitiveness into the sector are good, and that so is the support for young people. This is an important, meaningful programme that also affects small entrepreneurs. What we really need is development. Simplified, leaner procedures that ensure direct payment are vital, to ensure that a sector that finds itself in great difficulty has a chance for real development. That is why I voted in favour and why I have supported an intervention that also allows for direct payments to young farmers to give them a chance and an opportunity to take the initiative and develop their business, which could bring significant results in terms of employment that the European Union cannot ignore.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure also falls within a wider context of a joint strategic framework on agriculture. It is an important intervention that ties in with the others also adopted in today’s sitting. We have, however, observed – including in light of the information provided by Mr De Castro – that the Council’s stance on opposing delegated acts constitutes an unwarranted removal of Parliament’s competences and powers. Inter-institutional dialogue would, instead, force the Council to take a more flexible stance. Simplification on EU funds and the possible use of the Structural Funds are important issues, as are the preservation of ecosystems, better organisation of the agri-food sector, improved attractiveness of farmers for investment and better development of skills tied to the results achieved.

Mr President, Commissioner, the new Cyprus Presidency – we wish you success in your work – ladies and gentlemen, what we have heard today has made it very clear that there is a vast gulf between the position of the Council, which considers the Schengen issue we are discussing today simply to be a legal issue, and, on the other hand, the clear and coherent position of the Commission, which suggests quickly returning to the codecision procedure. The Council deprived us of our say on 6 and 7 June and we are relying on the Council recalling its sense of joint responsibility in this particular case. Schengen is a product of civilisation, a real and, we would say, inalienable achievement: 40 000 km of land borders, almost 800 km of maritime borders, 25 countries involved and 400 million citizens. Citing the supposed problem of public safety is not enough to call into question something that remains an extremely valuable achievement. Schengen, like the single market, is among the few accomplishments of the European Union which we can now say is responsible for there being even partial European citizenship. What is needed is more cooperation, more cooperation in policing and judicial terms, responsibility and solidarity. Parliament wants an open and integrated Europe, where everyone fully plays their part and that is another challenge that we want to achieve with the decisive contribution of the Commission and with a Council that restores solidarity in its relations with Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that a report on the evolution of macro-regional strategies is extremely important because the frame of reference is certainly not just Africa, but all the continents that look out over this crucial area. It is an area that needs resources, infrastructure, partnership and cooperation, through an integration policy that must be developed further in light of what has happened in the area bordering on southern Europe – the so-called Arab Spring, with all the undeniably genuine freedom movements that have not always led to what we would have wished. Lasting stability is still required, however, and could be achieved through a partnership aimed more at young people. Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes with a Euro-Mediterranean focus will provide those areas with a further opportunity for growth and enable many young people to develop work there.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at such a complicated time of spending rationalisation, restraints and restructuring of expenditure, defining a reasonable balanced budget, as our rapporteur Mr La Via has done, is a clear sign of how we can do well even in a context of great difficulty. That said, as the LIBE Committee, we take note of the information that, once received from the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), was then tangibly transposed into positive assessments. I am referring to Frontex, as well as to the question of the Refugee Fund. However, when it comes to the safety of citizens, we believe that in 2013, the bridge year for the next financial perspective, something more tangible needs to be done. I refer, in particular, to that list of political priorities which, Madam President, leaves no reasonable doubt as to the efficacy of the fight against organised crime. In this area, more can probably be done, and we are confident that the same indication can later be drawn up by the Committee on Budgets. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this document, as well as the other document with which it forms the ‘two-pack’, because I believe that they could be important in creating both stability and growth. However, these alone are not enough. In any case, we believe that at a time of serious crisis such as that which the European Union is facing, Parliament should take on an even more courageous role than it has so far, and we believe that development, employment and the labour market go hand in hand with a mechanism for surveillance of the budgetary policy of each Member State, because discipline is extremely important. The European debt redemption fund could prove to be a useful tool, as could the annual coordinated public debt issuance framework. The European Investment Bank has a greater role in order to achieve budgetary, political and fiscal union, which are the essential objectives for growth and development, the need for which we are fully feeling and noticing at the moment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of European company law will undoubtedly determine the future of the European Union itself. One need think only of the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a sector that has gradually grown stronger but that now, more than ever, needs structural reform. The single European market will surely profit from the perspectives of a European company law with a vision. Clearly, this vision must be imparted by the Commission, and it seems to me that the Commissioner’s comments are heading in this direction. We need an action plan with clear, accessible rules, where reducing red tape is given a high profile, and where company law is there to serve SMEs and business in general. At the same time, we also need to look at other important issues, in particular, data protection, which must be updated and continually monitored and which could add to the burden on business. We need action for SMEs, extra safeguards for businesses to guarantee their rights, and cross-border mobility for companies, which must also be guaranteed and supported through an overarching approach aimed at meeting the requirements of company law, SMEs, healthy enterprise and, indeed, the employment market. We therefore trust that Mr Barnier’s proposals will bring company law in step with the times. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that this appointment is an extremely important event or that the European Union should look after the weak and the vulnerable if it wishes to be even more real, authoritative and charismatic. There can be no doubt that choosing a Special Representative for Human Rights is an extremely valuable thing to do. My congratulations of course go to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on the outstanding work he has done. Solidarity, accountability and cooperation: the Member States that put these qualities into practice need to be consistently supported, and we also need to impose conditions favouring those third countries that show particular interest in, and pay attention to, the protection of fundamental rights. That is with regard to trade relations. On the subject of immigration, we still have a number of unresolved issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights for people who flee their native countries because they can see their interests and needs being trampled on there. We need to treat these people with great respect as well. It is a question of natural rights, rights that are inherent to the individual and closely linked to the growth of his or her personality. The European Union must therefore ensure that this role is fulfilled as effectively as possible. The person who is chosen must have two qualities: charisma and courage, and must believe wholeheartedly in the job he or she is appointed to do. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at this time of great difficulty, with such an overwhelming financial and economic crisis, the Commissioner might feel there are other policy priorities to debate and discuss. Because otherwise, the issue of multilingualism, the issue of cultural wealth, the issue of democratic participation should already have been effectively resolved, but they have not. The European Union undoubtedly has union at a monetary level, while it does not yet at a fiscal or political level, and there is no doubt that the denial of rights of citizenship includes denial of the right to participation and information. What should consultation be for, if not to provide a procedure, a tool to help citizens understand what is happening and, through the occasional heated exchange of ideas, through proper debate, to come up with concrete proposals for the decisions that will then be taken by the European institutions? Standing between the goal and the procedures that have been identified, there is probably a strong political will on the part of the Commission. Yet there are a number of innovative opportunities, including websites, there are a number of tangible opportunities that could ensure that the cultural wealth – which should be encouraged – has a tangible opportunity for growth. Otherwise, there will not be much point in further extending the boundaries of the European Union, and it will not be possible to guarantee the social cohesion that is created through an open challenge towards the territory. It is true, we must combine the instrument of political consultations with the effectiveness of parliamentary activities in the best possible way, and we still need to make optimum use of resources in a context where they need to be used rationally. Nevertheless, Madam President, if Parliament really wishes to be the home for all EU citizens, much more needs to be done and we call upon the Commission to make a great effort in this direction. Salvatore Iacolino,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

Mr President, I take note of the speeches by Mr Gerbrandy, whom I congratulate, and the Commissioner. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I can only welcome the inclusion in the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of many of the suggestions made in our report from the Committee on International Trade. There is no doubt that, in the context of the EU’s external dimension, trade in environmental goods and services is an instrument of particular significance for economic and social development. In particular, the opening up of the markets to highly energy-efficient goods and services plays a role in Europe’s conscientious growth in terms of exports, the creation of new jobs related to the spread of new green technologies, and innovation and competitiveness for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In our opinion, we have reaffirmed the importance of some essential elements in future European bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements: the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services; the inclusion of a section on sustainability; the inclusion of tariff preferences for environmental goods and services produced within the Generalised System of Preferences; not to mention the simplification of procedures. The European Union must maintain its global leadership in protecting the environment and promoting, through trade, the use of green goods, services and technologies in third countries for truly sustainable global growth. We must, Commissioner, particularly in relation to third countries, encourage the conclusion of trade agreements consistent with the proposed energy efficiency measures, thus ensuring deliberate, smart growth within the European Union.

OECD data on youth unemployment in the EU, which stands at around 22%, contrast with the provisions of Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out a number of actions at European level regarding young people, their education, employment and vocational training. Initiatives for growth, in this sense, are fundamental factors in the coordinated and harmonious development of the EU single market. Intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth are three main objectives for developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation and, at the same time, fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. These objectives are pursuable only through effective and efficient use of EU funds, in particular, the Structural Funds, of which EUR 82 billion remains unspent, much of which could be aimed at young people, in particular through small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby contributing to the creation of employment opportunities. I am therefore in favour of a future policy providing opportunities for young people by identifying further and more ambitious funding sources to help them to cope with high youth unemployment. I also consider it essential to allocate significant resources when drawing up the 2014-2020 financial framework, focusing on young people who are not in employment, education or training. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union’s internal security strategies are undoubtedly a fundamental reference point for protecting citizens. It is equally clear, however, that if this section is not allocated sufficient resources to enable these important objectives to be enacted, then security will remain – as it has thus far – a possible but somewhat indefinite option. Recent events show that security must be guaranteed not only through significant resource allocations but also through strong cooperation based on trust between Member States. The fight against organised crime and terrorism requires strong solidarity between Member States, safeguards for the licit economy, and robust law enforcement against all transnational threats. This demands a prevention-based approach, including border protection and effective enforcement measures to combat organised crime, mafias and terrorism. It is a challenge which, together, we can win. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, I have supported the de Jong report because it takes account, above all, of a valuable principle: that of the specific character and history of each nation and thus the substantive criminal law of each Member State. It is also concerned with protecting fundamental rights, respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and – in a European Union intent on dealing a real and fatal blow to organised crime, terrorism and corruption – allowing the judicial rulings issued by one Member State to be recognised in the others. In addition, it talks about the goal of harmonisation, with all the premises stated thus far, the definition of offences common to Member States and those guarantees for accused persons, especially under cross-examination, that may become the symbol of a common criminal law in the EU.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction plays a crucial role in respect of a priority which should perhaps be supported more strongly and incisively by the European Parliament, and that is the battle against drugs and drug addiction, at a time when addiction is not limited to drugs and psychotropic substances, because there are other addictions that should and could be better tackled through a list of actions that the European Union should support. To go back to the assessment, we found that the financial management was properly carried out, and we believe that in the financial perspectives for 2014-2020, more resources should be allocated to a context in which adolescence is often subject to serious attack. Information sharing on the web is important, as are Facebook and the Internet, but these, too, can sometimes lead to specific types of addiction. The monitoring centre could propose improvements for supporting multilingualism and we believe that it can improve its work, which is extremely positive, still further by introducing flexible measures in organisational terms. Stronger ties, which, in actual fact, already exist, with other agencies and with the Member States would allow us to confirm that the prospects for growth in this delicate area exist, based on a principle and value which is that of an overall strategy on addiction, and therefore not just on addiction to drugs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight months have now elapsed since we went to Lampedusa, in Sicily, to note and observe at first-hand what had happened during a year of increasing migration flows. However, the tragedies that have taken place in this period have not come to an end one little bit; quite the contrary. Even now, and already since April, other tragedies are being played out: 10 refugees have died en route
, which is a worrying sign from which we can clearly deduce that not everything that might have been done up till now has been done. We have a priority, which is to ensure that this House and the European institutions are seriously committed to three values – solidarity, responsibility and also courage. The Council, no less than the Commission, should probably have been much more courageous. To begin with, this is the case in the negotiations that must deliver more resources in the 2013 budget and the new 2014-2020 financial framework precisely for the protection and security of the EU’s territory, and in the meantime, in cooperation with third countries, remembering the good work done by Frontex, which can and must be improved. There are priorities that cannot be asked of others: bilateral agreements with border countries cannot be put in place by individual Member States. We should like to know what stage the agreement with Libya has reached and whether progress has been made with Tunisia and Egypt. What is more, when it comes to readmission, we need to ensure that readmission, wherever possible, can take place in the territory of origin. The Mediterranean is a thousand-year-old area where the bonds of peace have always existed between the countries on its shores. Now more than ever, however, we have a prospect in which individual Member States cannot cope with an emergency that is European. It is Europe that must take on the burden: strongly, enthusiastically, passionately, immediately and without delay. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE
),

 The tendency shown by the European Commission to focus attention on major hub airports is in complete contrast with the need for connection of areas such as islands and outermost regions, which need full accessibility and territorial integration due to their physical and natural characteristics. Equally, it is important for the European Commission to review Decision 2012/21/EU on the application of Article 106, in order to better understand the vital importance of the impact of these investments on territorial cohesion and social and economic development, especially in regions where other forms of transport are lacking. Furthermore, EU cofinancing by the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), cohesion and regional funds would allow regional airports to play a leading role in the creation of a wider European Common Aviation Area and therefore, during its review of the TEN-T, the Commission needs to recognise the vital link between regional air services and economic regeneration. I therefore remain convinced that future trans-European network policy must guarantee the mobility of people and goods and make regions, including peripheral regions, more attractive, as a practical contribution to revitalising investments and employment in the Single European Market. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, human trafficking is without doubt a heinous crime, but it is also a crime of transnational proportions. Eradicating it requires international cooperation between Member States and third countries, with a pre-eminent role for the EU institutions. We must overcome the exploitation inherent in prostitution, illegal labour and micro-criminality. However, talking about human trafficking without talking about organised crime would be to take a partial approach to such a worrying phenomenon, since human trafficking is very often controlled by organised crime. In the last few days we saw the establishment of the Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (CRIM), of which I am the rapporteur. One of our guiding principles and political priorities will no doubt be to make the very most of our work so as to achieve greater collaboration and cooperation with third countries, because we think that regular and legal migration should be encouraged, while illegal migration should be countered strongly and – if we can manage it – eradicated. We therefore need bilateral agreements between the EU and individual third countries on regulating migratory flows, protecting basic freedoms through strong guarantees, and the involvement of Europol and Frontex in particular. All of which must be done in the pursuit of two principles – solidarity and responsibility – without which there is no way there will be any progress. That is also the overarching direction that we will be giving to the CRIM Committee, and the fact that a directive shortly to be transposed in all the Member States is an essential tool in the fight against human trafficking tells us just how much difference a strong European approach could make to this worrying and ongoing phenomenon. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes a year after another, essentially identical debate. One year ago Lampedusa was overrun, as was the case in Greece this year and in previous years. Mr Busuttil made the point not long ago: 60 000 people came to Lampedusa, but certainly had no intention of staying there. These migrants – economic migrants – arrive in Italy, Greece and Malta, not by any means to stay there but rather to move on to other EU Member States. The answer to this is more Europe, more responsibility, more solidarity and enterprise. Negotiations have been opened on the funds for this area of action over the 2014-2020 planning period and might I suggest that Ms Malmström steps in there, just as the Council is pushing for a more enterprising approach. There is no doubt that there are some obstreperous Member States. What we need to do is overcome this attitude, otherwise Europe will not make any progress in this regard. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE
),

 Education means using intelligent methods to give expression to each person’s intrinsic potential. Increasing education, training and research is a cornerstone of growth and modernisation in higher education. However, the success of tertiary education also depends on policies to improve the social inclusion of minorities, gender equality and cutting the number of school-leavers. On top of these goals, there is the aim of encouraging institutions to systematically integrate mobility for education purposes within their programmes. Suitable funding is, however, required in order to achieve this: currently it is just 1.3% of gross domestic product, compared with 2.7% in the USA. Language skills are, moreover, in high demand among businesses and good skills in this area improve job prospects. Also connected to this is the equally important subject of e
-learning: the fusion of education and computer literacy, which provides innovative ways for teaching new generations. Europe’s future strength in this area will depend on putting higher education at the heart of innovation, creating jobs and employable skills, and on the ability of higher education institutions to play a full role in the knowledge triangle: connecting teaching, research and business to boost excellence and regional development.

 I voted in favour because I firmly believe that Europe must support the winds of freedom blowing through the Mediterranean, with a strategic commitment to promoting democracy, by means of urgent, concrete help. In this regard, I believe that establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy could be one of the most tangible responses by the European Union to the challenges of democratisation in our neighbourhood. The Arab Spring showed Europe the great aspirations towards democracy of the Mediterranean populations, as well as the urgency of addressing the instability generated by undemocratic regimes in the EU’s neighbourhood. In particular, the events we have witnessed have been surprising for the role played by civil society and the power of popular protest. For this reason, I am very much in favour of the bottom-up approach that will guarantee direct support to civil society. However, this instrument will only be able to operate effectively if clear and transparent rules are adopted for the distribution of funds, inspired by an across-the-board involvement of civil society and pluralistic support for parties and associations.

 Free movement is one of the EU’s most cherished achievements, which is also confirmed by the fact that 88% of European citizens (interviewed) recognise it as the most familiar of the four freedoms introduced by the EU. The programmes relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with increased synergy with other EU programmes, can undoubtedly help to give new impetus to the concept of European citizenship and to dismantle the obstacles that are still restricting it. Accordingly, the proper functioning of the single market is based on dismantling the obstacles to economic and social cohesion in the EU, which can be achieved, as the Commission has reiterated, by updating Directive 2005/36/EC in order to allow for the swifter, less bureaucratic recognition of professional qualifications. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must represent an additional opportunity for Europe to dismantle the further obstacles that still prevent European citizens from fully enjoying their rights as European citizens, and help to build a single market at the service of citizens. Finally, it should be emphasised that while EU citizenship is often considered secondary to national citizenship, it can be used as a ‘preparatory citizenship’ for non-EU citizens who meet certain conditions, such as ‘good conduct’.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, though it may have taken a long time to reach an agreement, there is no doubt that this programme constitutes an instrument of great solidarity and for this reason its success must be warmly welcomed. We are of the opinion that joint resettlement is a great opportunity of redemption for many desperate people looking for protection, people who come from extremely difficult situations and who deserve a willingness on our part that is not just formal but tangible and substantive. There must be a responsible contribution from Member States, given that this is on a voluntary basis. Eurostat has in recent days announced the data: over 300,000 applications. I am pleased to note that the country that ranks first in accepting applications for humanitarian protection is Italy, a country which once again needs the constructive backing of the European Union because, as you will know, landings in Lampedusa have started again on a massive and significant scale. The Italian Government must do a lot, but this tangible backing from the European Union also needs to be there. We are of course opposed to illegal migratory flows, which must be firmly opposed because they are often in the hands of organised crime syndicates, and we are looking at a time period of 2013, and then at 2014-2020, in order to ensure that resettlement programmes may become a real and tangible goal. We would like to acknowledge the rapporteur, on the one hand, and Commissioner Malmström, on the other, for working so hard on this matter. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a joint motion for a resolution on a subject of particular importance – that of discrimination, of aversion to those who must in fact be integrated and welcomed where there is clearly a chance of work or reuniting a family – is undoubtedly helpful. European citizenship is a subject of extraordinary value. We certainly need to be conscious of it; we need to give new life to the theme of reception and integration; we need to bear in mind that there are directives – Directive 2004/38/EC, which is essential in this respect – and while we are working on celebrations for 2013, the designated European Year of Citizens, all this is why we need to remove every obstacle that hitherto has specifically caused these difficulties. In the meantime, the Internet, while it is a key means of knowledge, must definitely be linked to a series of essential requirements to which its users should adhere. Thank you.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important requirement and one that must be supported, just as we must support the advancement of the status of women, not only in the workplace. Important progress has been made in recent decades, including through absolutely cutting-edge EU legislation. Sixty per cent of our graduates are women but there is no doubt that accessing the world of work is tricky when women choose family life as well as work. The family needs to be safeguarded and protected, while the gender gap definitely has to be significantly reduced through well-defined social policies, greater working flexibility and, of course, by protecting vulnerable women. Let us remember that when it comes to trafficking in human beings, it is often women who are the victims, which is also an important subject to which yet further attention must be paid. Salvatore Iacolino,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have listened carefully to the indications from the Commission about reinforcing judicial training. There is no doubt that this is a top priority, because we believe that the judicial training of magistrates and judicial practitioners serves not only to bring the various legal systems closer together – though they must remain distinct due to the typical characteristics of each – but certainly this mutual tangible cooperation can certainly facilitate what, today more than ever, is the transnational dimension of the law: lawyers, judicial practitioners, who must be supported by a common and consistent judicial training sector, possibly through exchanges via Erasmus, so as to set out an area of freedom, justice and security in which each component can make its own voice heard in a common European market in which competitiveness and sustainability are closely linked to a system of free movement of professions, in which it is important to have high quality assurance standards. For this reason, it is important to have a European professional card, a sort of European accreditation, in a context in which trust – as set out in the Stockholm Programme between the various Member States – should be based on a tangible mutual recognition of judicial orders, so that entry of young judicial practitioners onto the labour market can be facilitated and so that those who have the ability to use more than one language ​can be taken into account. There is still a role for the most important agencies in a context in which the financial perspectives of the 2014-2020 budget will have to be characterised not only by important and significant pilot projects, such as the one that has just been mentioned, but by appropriate and adequate resources so as to expand the number of people benefiting from this programme. Thank you. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that family reunification is an issue of substance, one that is serious and concrete. The welfare of the family must take precedence over anything else, even if it is, of course, undeniable that this right must be subject to rules. In my opinion, the 2003 directive contains useful rules, though they must be applied uniformly and homogeneously within the territory of all Member States. For this reason, the Commission has quite rightly initiated a serious debate by publishing a Green Paper, in which it sets out a clear vision: to introduce concrete measures in support of a process of family reunification which, in my opinion, simply has to be taken into account. I am the rapporteur of a document on information and communications technology, on the transfer of workers who are third-country nationals to establishments located both in third countries and in Europe. In this particular case, a more favourable exception clause was carried in committee to ensure family reunification at a practical level, which is definitely a political priority for the European People’s Party. Of course, language is important, and we must ensure that the European agenda on migratory flows – again in this case we are speaking of legal immigration – takes account of this directive, which is absolutely correct and practical. The Commission’s goal must be to urge Member States to adopt rules that can and will be applied in practice and, at the same time, ensure that the right to be together is truly recognised, one to which no one can object. The PPE’s aim is to ensure that the 500 000 individuals who are potential beneficiaries of this rule are given due consideration by Member States. Susy De Martini  (ECR

 I voted in favour of this report for which I was shadow rapporteur for the ECR Group. However, I believe that it fails to adequately balance the importance of strong bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and the EU with legitimate concerns over the Kingdom’s human rights record. Instead, the report is almost entirely dominated by the latter. In fact, the report does not adequately recognise progress made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in some aspects of human rights and equality, in particular with regard to the role of women. The report also does not properly consider the important role played by Saudi Arabia in counter-terrorism or EU-Saudi trade relations. I therefore feel that, while I am able to vote in favour of the report, I also consider it to be a missed opportunity to engage positively with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, stressing our existing relations with it as a key strategic partner in the region, proposing measures to strengthen EU-Saudi links, and also to work constructively with them to improve their human rights record.

Madam President, I must say to Baroness Ashton, as a physician and a human being, that I have a specific concern, namely about so-called ‘Cuban health diplomacy’. Cuba is sending out doctors under government-to-government cooperation agreements. This practice has now become Cuba’s biggest industry, bringing in USD 6 billion. In Venezuela alone, there are more than 30 000 Cuban doctors, traded for oil; in Brazil there are 6 000 of them. The host countries pay for each doctor about USD 5 000 per month, while the doctors themselves receive only USD 25. These bilateral agreements clearly violate a number of International Labour Organisation conventions. One of the escaped Cuban doctors recently stated, ‘We are the highest qualified slave labour force in the world.’ Are we sure that we should continue to finance Cuba, with EUR 30 million each year?

 Madam President, I am new here, and therefore I thank you twice for giving me the opportunity to speak for the first time. I will now switch to my other mother tongue, Italian. Signora Presidente, l'Iniziativa dei cittadini europei, particolarmente importante in questo momento di sfiducia nei confronti dell'Europa, sembra avere qualche problema di comunicazione e burocratico, com'è già stato rilevato dalla signora Commissario e da altri colleghi. Faccio un esempio pratico su tutti, che riguarda proprio il mio paese, l'Italia: l'Iniziativa sull'acqua pubblica ha raccolto, dopo nove mesi, poco più di 25.000 firme sulle 54.000 necessarie per l'Italia, mentre sullo stesso soggetto, a livello di referendum 
nazionale, erano state raccolte nel 2011, quindi poco fa, in pochi mesi più di un milione di firme. Questa discrepanza di successo fra l'iniziativa di un singolo Stato e quella europea non può essere spiegata se non con le esistenti difficoltà di comunicazione e di ordine burocratico. So che è stata presentata un'iniziativa per semplificare questo diritto d'iniziativa. Sembra un gioco di parole, ma è una realtà che mi fa venire in mente questa frase "Un cammello è l'esatta descrizione di un cavallo fatta da un burocrate". Spero proprio che la Commissione possa porre un veloce rimedio a quanto sta accadendo.Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, Mr Sonik had a long and complex task, and overall we should welcome his report. However, it is clear that there are still many doubts about extraction of shale gas and oil. The other speeches we have heard also share this view, in particular with regard to environmental and public health protection. I therefore welcome the series of studies undertaken by the European Commission on potential risks resulting from shale gas extraction. Only on the basis of their results will we be able to give a clear answer and be in a position to adopt a new EU framework Directive for regulating mining activities. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, this proposal for a regulation aims to simplify the current legal framework and to establish new administrative and technical requirements for the type-approval of new L-category vehicles, of which there are currently around 30 million in Europe. Until now, the 2002 Framework Directive and 14 other directives referring to it set out the requirements in a rather convoluted legislative framework that is happily being replaced by a consolidated text. A refined vehicle categorisation achieved by introducing more appropriate subcategories, more severe emission limits, the mandatory introduction of anti-lock brake systems on some types of vehicle and the automatic headlight-on system to improve the visibility of L-vehicles are just some of the innovations to be introduced thanks to this report. The benefits to be gained in terms of safety, environmental protection and improved functioning of the internal market are beyond doubt and because of this I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 In a parliamentary democracy, the link between the public nature of debates and votes, and democratic accountability, is inescapable. If we do not give European citizens the ability to know what their elected representatives have said and how they voted, I wonder whether they will be able to hold them to account at the next elections. The review of Rule 70 of the Rules of Procedure, through the incorporation of some key elements of the Code of conduct for negotiating in the context of the ordinary legislative procedures in the binding part of the Rules, will make the procedures more effective, more transparent and above all more inclusive.

The statistics for 2011 show that no Member has ever requested the translation of the entire verbatim report of proceedings in his or her own language.

 A Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) on 29 April 2008 between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Serbia, of the other part, was signed in Luxembourg. The Commission has proposed an Implementing Regulation to facilitate the application of the Interim Agreement, which lays down rules and procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of these Agreements. Mr Winkler felt that the amendments to the Commission proposal under examination should mirror the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I report. I agree with the rapporteur because this will guarantee the consistency and coherence of the European Parliament’s position on the matter. Consequently the report contains amendments aimed at aligning the amended provisions with the amendments brought about by the Trade Omnibus I Regulation to the five Regulations on the application of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements and the Interim Agreements with the other Western Balkan countries.

 The right of a citizen of an unrepresented Member State to seek assistance from the consular authorities of other Member States that are represented is one of the rights conferred by EU citizenship. It is a right that has existed for some years, but European citizens are still not fully informed of it. As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am more than satisfied with the work done on this report. I believe that the measures adopted will improve the enforcement of this right, through better coordination between Member States on consular representation. The only doubt that remains is how these new measures will be publicised among European citizens.

Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr La Via on his excellent work on the report on the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2013. His task was difficult, and there seemed little likelihood of an agreement between the Member States and the European Parliament. Despite the prolonged period of crisis and constant requests for cuts to EU expenditure, Mr La Via and Mr Vaughan together managed to ensure continuity for current policies and initiatives. I think it was particularly important that any slowing down of the pilot projects in the areas of energy and the environment was avoided, a clear sign of the good work carried out by the European Parliament in defending the prerogatives of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with I would like to recall that the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 are proceeding in a very difficult social, economic and financial context. I regret to say that the European Union is increasingly seen by citizens as an additional burden to be borne by taxpayers, rather than an important resource. I am convinced that this situation is caused by the fact that the EU budget is not in line with national budgets, since it has not been expanded to take account of the duties and competencies assigned to the Union under the Treaty of Lisbon, or of the important political Decisions taken by the European Council. I voted in favour of the report because I was aware of the need to reach an interinstitutional compromise and to send a clear signal to citizens. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Commission’s proposal to amend Article 103o of the Single CMO Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007), which provides for the possibility for Member States to grant decoupled aid to vine growers under the single payment scheme (SPS), definitely needed to be amended. I endorse Mr Dorfmann’s work and the proposals he put forward, as they ensure farmers receive predictable payments of aid. The report also effectively confronts the current changing situation of the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform. Above all, it was important to avoid Member States planning five-year decisions that are actually not compatible with the Commission’s proposal for a new system of direct support, just as it was essential to link the calendar for the final transfer decision to the calendar of the future reform. All these problems were considered in the report and the solutions reached are very positive. This is why I voted in favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has been in use since 2008 as a free service to Member States with a view to improving the exchange of information within the internal market. To date, the IMI system still operates on the basis of a Commission decision and a Commission recommendation and, as a result, lacks a single legal instrument. This has been a major obstacle to further expansion of the IMI system, which should have been overcome long ago. We have seen that the system has worked perfectly with regard to the Professional Qualifications Directive and the Services Directive. The system has proven its value as a rapid and secure means for cross-border information exchange and administrative cooperation with currently over 6 000 registered authorities in all EU Member States and EEA (European Economic Area) countries. Therefore, I welcome the report’s proposals and I hope that the expansion in IMI application to other sectors will have clear benefits for citizens and for the internal market.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation No 73/2009, which provides the rules for the current system of direct payments to farmers, will be superseded by other proposals under the common agricultural policy (CAP) reform for 2014-2020 In its proposals for the multiannual financial framework and the CAP for 2014-2020, the Commission is proposing to make use of a new crisis reserve to address additional financing needs resulting from unexpected agricultural crises. The net ceiling in 2013 for EU Member States would be equal to the value of the net ceiling in 2012, with the adjustments deriving from grubbing-up in 2012 and the appraised transfer of the wine envelopes to the single payment scheme. I agree with the solution contained in the report and therefore I voted in favour of Mr Capoulas Santos’s proposal, because I think we need to maintain the current financial structure for 2013 in order to ensure continued levels of payments and to support agricultural development in an effective way. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, protecting animal welfare standards is part of and complementary to sustainable development policy. European institutions, as signatories to the agreement on sustainable development, must do all they can to ensure these standards are adequate. The deterioration in the state of health of wild animals could result in an increased spread of contagious diseases to domestic animals and, at the same time, have an adverse effect on public health; I voted in favour of Ms Paulsen’s proposal, since I think the current regulations need to be better enforced, with special focus on the animal transport sector. I welcome the inclusion in the strategy of a European animal welfare framework law and join in Ms Paulsen’s call for this law to be clearly formulated, followed by a consultation with all relevant parties.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until now, the Commission has been financing programmes such as MED 2007-2013 and the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument for cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Now that the 2007-2013 financial programming period is coming to an end, I think we need to ask the Commission to start a process of dialogue and consultation in order to define future macro-regional strategies. Priority areas to be targeted by future support still have to be identified, and that must be done while taking into account the need to strengthen existing cooperation, particularly between areas of Europe belonging to different Member States but sharing the same services and working area. I voted for Mr Alfonsi’s motion for a resolution because I consider the Mediterranean to be a coherent whole, a single cultural and environmental area in which joint priorities such as crops, renewable energy sources and tourism can be shared. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a single European railway area provides a major opportunity to support economic recovery and make the single market more competitive. The variety of national railway systems hampers this process: numerous legislative barriers slow down development in the sector and limit the competitiveness of rail transport. We should establish transparent rules on access to rail-related services and service facilities, such as freight terminals, maintenance facilities and marshalling yards. Ms Serracchiani’s report is a step in that direction, and that is why I voted for it. The Council is calling for too long a period – up to 36 months – for this new directive to enter into force. Accordingly, I endorse the rapporteur’s request to set a period of 12 months for the transposition of the entire directive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by improving the harmonised control of driving time and rest periods, digital tachographs can play a vital role in ensuring that the internal road haulage market functions properly, which will greatly benefit road safety. A number of recent police reports from certain Member States have shown that fraudulent use of these devices has risen, and therefore a change to the regulation in force is urgently required. According to the Commission, the increased cost of purchasing a new tachograph is expected to be around EUR 5 per vehicle, which is negligible compared with the potential benefits that could accrue. I voted in favour of Ms Ţicău’s proposal because I believe tachographs and vehicle satellite tracking systems should be synchronised to make services more efficient and more reliable. The ability to transmit tachograph data remotely will also lead to better control and a substantial improvement in road safety. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we look back at some of the serious environmental disasters we are all familiar with, we can see that there have been numerous cases where disastrous environmental consequences have followed industrial accidents. These cases also show that at times the impact of accidents can extend beyond national borders. I have voted in favour of my fellow Member’s proposal since I believe Directive 96/82/EC must be replaced so that the existing protection levels are not only maintained, but strengthened. I also think that the new provisions should be clearer, consistent and easily understandable, in order to contribute to the streamlining of administrative procedures. Finally, I would argue it is necessary to keep a certain amount of flexibility to be able to amend Annex I to deal with any unwanted effects of the alignment to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and any subsequent adjustments to that regulation that could have an impact on the classification of dangerous substances.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses establishes general provisions regarding the composition and manufacture of said foods. This directive’s provisions mostly date back to 1977 and no longer meet the needs of today's consumers. Therefore an in-depth revision of the directive was needed and for this reason I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s proposal. I would still argue that it is absolutely necessary to protect consumers more, simplify regulations and tackle the difficulties that Member States and operators encounter in interpreting the various existing pieces of food legislation. This would mean similar products could be treated in the same way throughout the Union, creating a level playing field for all internal market operators and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and end-consumers.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information and communication technologies (ICTs) can make a significant contribution to the development of the economy and society. However, to make the most of these potentials, first they need to be made secure. The many disputes regarding existing legislation on data privacy and intellectual property rights enforced in the Internet environment should give us much food for thought. I supported Mr Kalfin’s proposal because I believe that the potential offered by the web, in terms of both innovation and growth for European enterprises, must not be lost, especially in a highly competitive context such as currently exists at global level. Nonetheless, I want to emphasise that I believe in the need for a rapid implementation of the European programme for critical information infrastructure protection (ECIP), including the creation of the Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, due to climate change, the steady rise in environmental pollution, industrialisation and the increasing population growth, we are facing global energy challenges. I believe it would be useful to strengthen the external dimension of EU energy policy by taking a clear stance on the diversification of energy sources and routes. I voted in favour of Ms Herczog’s proposal because I think it is essential to guarantee security of supply and, at the same time, to support sustainable production and consumption. I firmly hope, however, that in the future, we will have greater coordination between Member States’ policies and joint action and solidarity in the field of external energy policy and energy security. In this respect, we must recognise the importance of transparency and implementation of the internal energy market. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted for this resolution in the belief that introducing new taxes will not, in itself, solve our problems; nevertheless, the introduction of certain taxes may lead to a reduction in taxation in other sectors. The financial sector is not contributing in a fair way to the cost of the global crisis at a time when EU citizens are faced with an increase in direct and indirect taxation and severe cuts in wages and pensions. The financial sector is still exempted from taxation in its activities and transactions. I therefore support Ms Podimata’s proposal, which envisages a taxation rate of 0.1% in respect of transactions other than those related to derivatives arrangements, and 0.01% in respect of transactions related to derivatives arrangements, which would generate new revenues of EUR 57 billion at EU level. I have one final comment to make: I would point out that, according to a Eurobarometer poll carried out in June 2011, a large majority of EU citizens are in favour of bringing in these measures. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the single market was conceived as a vital tool for steering Europe towards sustainable growth and full employment. If fully developed, it could provide a useful antidote to the economic crisis that has gripped Europe and the world for several years now. To that end, its supporting directives need to be properly transposed, applied and implemented. I therefore agree with Mr Busuttil’s proposals, which emphasise the need to implement these directives in order to be able to exploit the single market’s economic potential. The SOLVIT network has been shown to be a useful, effective tool for providing clear, timely solutions for citizens and businesses, thus helping to solve the problems associated with the misapplication of competition rules. As a non-judicial entity, the network is ideally placed to operate economically and effectively. I therefore hope that SOLVIT will be further reinforced and promoted to European citizens.

 Mr President, despite Turkey’s recent efforts and progress, culminating in the meeting between the Turkish Minister for Family and Social Policies and representatives from the Committee on Equal Opportunities, a number of important outstanding gender equality issues remain. Given that Turkey is a candidate country, the present gap will have to be bridged completely for it to be able to achieve current European Union standards. I am concerned, in particular, by the recent data on the safety and protection of women. It emerges that 39% of Turkish women have been attacked at least once in their lives. I agree with Mr Bozkurt’s proposal to encourage the Turkish Government to act swiftly to implement the measures needed to reduce the number of attacks. Finally, I would like to stress the importance of access to information and to education in ensuring gender mainstreaming at all educational levels. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the potential afforded by the new channels of communication is huge. In a world in which everything is digital, information is an asset for every European citizen. The European Union needs to protect all end users and try to reduce the existing disparities between Member States on the European market to a minimum. I would like to point out that, as the promoter of a single internal market, the European Union must also implement an internal telecommunications market. The significant differences between domestic and roaming prices obviously make these difficult goals to meet. I agree with Ms Niebler’s proposal. Each home provider must give customers clear and adequate information about the levels of consumption they have reached and agreed. Transparent information about the conclusion of contracts and the charges for data roaming services will be an appropriate means for protecting European consumers and I therefore voted in favour of the report.

 The European Union has a crucial role in European environmental policy. By signing Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, entering into the Rotterdam Convention, the EU has set itself the goal of incentivising and increasing information exchange about the chemicals traded between the parties to the convention and also to implement the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. The measure ensures that exporting countries of chemicals formally obtain consent from the importing countries before the export can take place. Mr Jørgensen’s proposal aims to limit the derogations usually adopted against the PIC procedure, thereby trying to defend the original meaning of the Convention. The joint intervention of the Commission and the designated national authorities will also be of significant help. This synergy will undoubtedly result in more accurate and reliable documentation on the possible impact on human health or the environment of using dangerous chemical substances in the importing country or another exporting country.

 Despite the fact that the situation in Myanmar is still far from what international institutions – the European Union in the first place – expect for the future, the progress achieved by the nation under the leadership of President Thein Sein can be seen by one and all. A political process has begun that has given rise to a series of radical changes: the satisfactory outcome of the by-elections held on 1 April; the release of a significant number of political prisoners; the adoption of a series of legislative and governmental measures aimed at increasing openness, from the initiation of economic reforms to the easing of press and Internet censorship and the promulgation of laws on freedom of association and the freedom to strike; and the initiation of a process of dialogue with the main ethnic groups. While recognising the still undeveloped context in which this process of opening and national reconciliation is taking place, the transition from a military to a civilian government and the democratic opposition’s possibility to be represented are basic aspects. Finally, I would like to emphasise that, in this sense, it was the firm diplomatic actions of Italy, Germany and France that led to the gradual easing of EU sanctions and to a gradual evolution of political and democratic structures in Burma.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps there has been an error in communication, but I had asked to speak to explain my vote. In the past decade we have witnessed a series of well-known dramatic events which have led to a consequent increase in the number of controls and restrictions in air travel. Meanwhile, the European Union, the USA, Canada and Australia have signed a variety of international agreements on the processing and storage of passenger data. Parliament already expressed its willingness to revise such agreements in May 2010, when it decided to reject the outcome of the negotiations between the countries involved. I am aware of the fact that the competent parliamentary committee has judged this agreement unsuitable, nonetheless I think it is more useful to maintain this new agreement, rather than referring to the current legislation. Since it is not possible to start new negotiations, it would be better to adopt these new measures and improve the previous framework with regard to data protection and the respect for individual rights. The rejection of these new results would deprive Europe of any minimum law in this field, and of any effective tool in combating terrorism and organised crime. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and its Member States have always promoted sustainable development and the protection of the environment and human health. The signing of the Kyoto Protocol and the Europe 2020 strategy are among the most important challenges that the EU has set itself. Taxation related to CO2
 emissions is a cost-effective means for Member States to achieve the reductions of greenhouse gasses necessary according to Decision 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. I am in favour of Ms Lulling’s proposal on the need to ensure that the internal market functions in an optimum manner in a context of new requirements relating to the limitation of climate change, to the use of renewable energy sources and to energy savings. Consistent treatment of energy sources should be guaranteed in order to provide a genuine level playing field for energy consumers regardless of the energy source used. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the approval of the EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World and the resolution on the EU’s support for the International Criminal Court, the European Parliament voted to act in a manner consistent and in conformity with EU obligations concerning the protection of human rights. Implementing national strategies already drawn up in recent months will be an important step in this direction. I agree with Mr Howitt’s proposal to call on the Commission to insert a ‘torture end-use’ clause into the 2005 Council Regulation concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture, etc. This would enable Member States to acquire detailed information and decide whether or not to refuse the export of the goods and substances in question.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we have witnessed fast economic growth on the part of Azerbaijan, whose economic potential is obvious to all. We must also recognise that there has been a strengthening of the strategic role of that country as an Eastern partner, in particular, in the energy sector. However, we must remember here that the gap in terms of democracy and the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights compared to the standards required by the European Union has not yet been completely bridged. I believe that these principles should be considered essential for the proper conduct of the negotiations and the stipulation of an association agreement with Azerbaijan. I hope that the Council and the Commission will be urging the Azerbaijani authorities to adopt an anti-discriminatory legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Meanwhile, we should welcome the reforms made by the Azerbaijani authorities in the judiciary in the last year, which should ensure greater independence of judges, and eliminate corruption in this area.

 The principal aim of cohesion policy and of the policy on the internal market is to organise policy initiatives directed towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, encouraging an economy with a high rate of employment that favours social and territorial cohesion. Nevertheless, the initial conditions in which the outermost regions (ORs) find themselves present an obstacle to, and a brake on, achieving the objectives that have been set, in particular, in the Europe 2020 strategy. As the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides, the ORs have a right to be treated differently, which enables them to benefit from the maximum level of aid, irrespective of their level of development. In this sense, I welcome the Commission’s plan to include a budget line for ‘Outermost regions and regions with a very low population density’ in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. I fully agree with the advisability of outermost regions pursuing the main objectives defined in the Europe 2020 strategy. However, I consider that we must emphasise the need to modulate the objectives in accordance with each outermost region’s own situation, taking into account their regional diversity, their structural conditions and their potential benefits.

 The current economic and financial crisis in Europe calls for the adoption of robust, decisive measures to stimulate economic growth. Of course, tax revenue is one of the most important tools with which the Member States can tackle the problems associated with the crisis. I warmly welcome the proposal put forward by Mr Casa. I think that it is essential to create a European fiscal union that includes a comprehensive, rapid, efficient and user friendly exchange of information among Member States in order to improve the fight against tax evasion and to optimise the revenue paid into Member States’ coffers. I hope that we can rise above partisan positions and that common sense will prevail at this difficult time. We must come to an agreement and find new resources in order to deal with the crisis.

 Respect for, and the defence of, human rights and democratic values are the fundamental principles on which the European Union is based. Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: ‘In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women’. On 7 July 2011, the European Parliament welcomed the initiative of establishing the European Endowment for Democracy, as did subsequently the Foreign Affairs Council. I agree with this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation, and I urge the Council to outline the methods for its creation. I believe that establishment of the Endowment could be a tangible and practical response by the European Union to the challenges posed by countries calling for greater democracy. I hope that this can take place as soon as possible, also in view of the timing imposed on us by the ‘Arab Spring’. The situation of instability afflicting the Middle East is clear and before our eyes, and we have to respond to it. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The inclusion of Kosovo in the stabilisation and association process (SAP), thanks to which it could benefit from EU assistance (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, IPA) and an independent preferential trade system, would ensure that Kosovo does not remain on the sidelines of the EU’s strategy in the area of the Western Balkans. In its communication of October 2011 on the enlargement strategy, the Commission showed how the post-election period of adjustment prevented Kosovo from making substantial progress in terms of reforms. On the other hand, in its conclusions of 5 December 2011, the Council called upon Kosovo to implement the actions decided on to compensate for these failings. I agree and support the Commission’s intention to carry out a feasibility study for the stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Kosovo. This commitment confirms the wish and commitment of the EU to carry forward the initiatives outlined in the General Affairs Council conclusions of December 2011 and, at the same time, shows that it can make a significant contribution in socio-political terms, which will be essential for reaching an agreement between Priština and Belgrade on the delicate issue of regional cooperation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before my explanation of vote, I would like to explain that I am wearing this T-shirt because I would like to ask the European Union to take decisive steps to secure the liberation of the two Italian soldiers, Captain Massimiliano Latorre and Sergeant Salvatore Girone, who have been unjustly detained for doing their duty against piracy. Mr President, the new general guidelines of the European Parliament on the 2013 budget will define the guidelines, objectives and strategies to be followed by the Commission when preparing the draft budget. The report in question sets out the key points for reviving the European economy in the light of the effects of, and the issues caused by, the ongoing nature of the economic crisis. I welcome the initiative not just because it makes the EU budget an ideal vehicle for encouraging cohesion between Member States, but also because it embodies an opportunity to review and adapt the new budget to the needs of the economic crisis that has hit the euro area. The initiative proposed by Mr La Via has my full support, and I especially welcome the request made to the Council not to make artificial cuts that do not take into account the effective absorption capacity of the programmes and consequently delay the implementation of cohesion policies.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I travelled personally to Macedonia during the last presidential elections as an envoy of the Group of the European People’s Party (PPE) in order to support Prime Minister Gruevski’s electoral campaign. Having met thousands of people, I was able to observe personally that it is not just the institutions but also the people who are decisively in favour of joining the European Union. This is why I believe we cannot put off starting negotiations, which have been suspended, for much longer, and should resume them as a matter of urgency. The 2011 progress report presented by the Commission shows that for the third consecutive year, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has managed to maintain positive progress in line with European standards in terms of political criteria and the development of a market economy. Therefore, I am confident that FYROM will manage to overcome the political and structural limitations that are still holding it back, and give my full support to the resumption of negotiations.

 The recent instalment of the new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 10 February brought an end to the political stalemate that had been created in the country and had stunted its development. This provides an excellent foundation for reviving the European agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Among the most significant actions taken by the new government, I should like to point out the initiatives to bring in a census, the adoption of the laws on State aid and the adaptation of the country’s constitution to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I support the motion tabled by Ms Pack: we must urge the Bosnian authorities to make further efforts and take further steps to meet the EU accession criteria. That said, I think it is essential that Bosnia and Herzegovina complies with the European Court of Human Rights ruling in the Sejdić-Finci case and with Article 2 of the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA), which give greater guarantees on human rights and democratic principles. The decision to dissolve the local office of the High Representative is quite correct and I think it will promote a greater sense of responsibility among the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999, with the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European signatory countries committed to working together to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. This target would have guaranteed academic quality, economic development and social cohesion, and employment and lifelong learning for graduates. I support Mr Berlinguer’s report because it calls for decisive and coordinated action at European level. The recognition of degrees based on an efficient system of quality assurance constitutes a good point of departure for encouraging Member States to adopt the national framework of qualifications for lifelong learning. It is essential to implement and develop a European system of higher education that allows and encourages the free movement of knowledge. I think the measures contained in the report represent the right path to follow to make Europe more productive and competitive. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that currently, 1.5 billion people in the world are unable to access energy sources. Globally, forecasts indicate that over the next two decades, the funds allocated to energy will amount to USD 26 trillion – just 3% of that sum would ensure universal access to energy by 2030. The proposal put forward by Mr Neuser concerning the possibility of developing and extending access to modern energy services should be a starting point for the EU to begin to address the problem of poverty and sustainable development through targeted, effective action. I agree with Mr Neuser’s proposals: we Europeans must also make our contribution towards improving energy access for the poor in developing countries. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented by Mr Schmidt, which is the Commission’s first initiative in the area of tax, makes a positive contribution to outlining future legislative initiatives on this issue.

In this regard, the Commission’s intention to strengthen the legal framework on savings taxation and the review of taxation on energy products is a positive step. Although Member States have expressed diverging opinions on the validity and efficacy of this initiative, overall, I welcome Mr Schmidt’s report and this is why I decided to support it.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schwab’s report shows how EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits for consumers. The use of flexible, dynamic procedures has enabled competition policy to act as a driver and not as an obstacle to the European financial and economic system. I voted in favour of the report as I fully agree with the objectives contained in it. In particular, I support the aim of improving price transparency in order to stimulate competition in the market and protect consumer rights. At a time of recession, we absolutely have to try and incentivise consumers. Finally, I would like to add that the information exchange between the Commission and consumer associations should continue and be stepped up and extended to stakeholders. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The reluctance of Member States to take steps to harmonise some aspects of their respective systems of procedural law does no good for the States themselves or, above all, for European citizens. The ‘by stages’ approach adopted by the Commission is proving to be a winning strategy. However, I think Parliament ought to make itself heard before the Council in order to try and speed up the process for adopting the other directives in this area. Having to talk, in 2011, about rules on the entitlement of suspected and accused persons to be informed of their rights and of the charge against them in criminal proceedings within EU Member States seems, to say the least, like something of an anachronism.

 The legislative vacuum in the EU on protecting victims of crime from further attacks once the victims have left their Member State of origin was a serious and unacceptable flaw in a united Europe.

While I understand the Council’s reasons, the situation the Member State economies were in required an austerity-based response, and in this sense, the compromise agreement we have reached is a satisfactory solution. I share Commissioner Lewandowski’s doubts, but I would like to reiterate that the possibility of adopting an amending budget at a later date, should it not be possible to meet the payments, has rightly been included in the joint statement by the Parliament and the Council. Finally, I am pleased that we have managed to honour our promises on the immigration policy appropriations. We cannot predict what repercussions the political situation in the Maghreb may have, and we must be prepared and in possession of the right tools to deal with any emergency. Therefore, I hope the subject can be the subject of debate in this House. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe and its history speak through the huge achievements that have distinguished the development of civilisation in our countries. Much of Europe’s history is told through the roads, the monuments and the convents that, in times of darkness, have given dignity to the journey of the peoples of Europe. I support the stance taken in this measure which, naturally, perhaps ought to be extended to the countries waiting to join the EU, the Western Balkan countries, because I think it would be a good idea to involve them in this project of identifying a European brand. I think their involvement would send out a positive message to them.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the railway sector has always been something of a special case, where the competitive ethos of the single market and the European Union has taken root rather late. The deficiencies in the services that this sector offers to citizens are linked precisely to this lateness. I am convinced that more transparent and smoother conditions for accessing the market, together with explicit rules on conflicts of interest and discriminatory practices in the railway sector, will be the right measures to spur on greater competition. I completely agree with the legislative proposal on the complete, mandatory separation between infrastructure managers and businesses operating the transport services, namely train companies. I invite the Commission to put forward concrete proposals on this within the pre-established timeframes. I believe that the measures contained in the report will allow us to make it easier to provide train services, boosting the quality offered to passengers and people using freight services. Ms Serrachiani’s report provides tangible responses to the request for greater liberalisation and competition in the railway sector and accordingly I have given it my full support.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s motion is a bold step in the right direction. Despite the austerity required by the Member States and by the domestic budget deficits, the European Union is duty bound to do everything it can to ensure growth and employment in Europe. I completely agree with Ms Balzani and Mr Fernandes and therefore voted in favour of the resolution. The crisis must not be tackled solely through austerity measures, but also through investment in research and in the cohesion policy. Administrative costs must be kept in check and Parliament has sent out a clear and firm message on this. I hope, however, that good sense will prevail in the next meeting of the Conciliation Committee. The Council must open its eyes and realise that cutting competitiveness and cohesion will only sink our economy even deeper into the mire. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, although it is important to reduce the emission of gaseous pollutants and pollutants produced by internal combustion engines in non-road mobile machinery, we cannot turn a blind eye to the current situation in which manufacturers find themselves. Since 2008, the financial and economic crisis has hit the non-road mobile machinery sector hard. It was essential for us to further extend the flexibility scheme for the transition from Stage III A to Stage III B. The increase in the number of engines used for application in land-based machines under the flexibility scheme, from 20% to 37.5%, is, in my opinion, an unsatisfactory result for European industry in this sector. However, given the situation and Parliament’s continual delays, manufacturers were demanding a rapid response. I would like to specify that it is for this reason alone that I decided to support the report with my vote. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, I, too, fully agree with the general approach of Ms Rühle’s report, and I therefore voted in favour.

I endorse Ms Rühle’s view that it is the public procurement directives themselves which are the main impediment to involving public contracting authorities in the pursuit of general social aims: the criterion of the lowest price cannot carry the same weight as that of the most economically advantageous tender. It must be stipulated that contracts are to be awarded to the most economically advantageous tender. Only then will the criteria for selecting what is most economically advantageous be easier to implement. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, European consumers’ confidence in the financial system has been severely tested in the last few months, and the Belgian case is clear evidence of this. I am convinced that the system of compensating the potential losses of consumers in the event of bankruptcy of financial institutions or insurance companies, together with insurance guarantee schemes, could make a precious contribution to reducing the risks of policyholders and beneficiaries. I voted in favour of this report. However, I would like to emphasise that, until now, European consumers have not had access to sufficient information in cases of insurance company insolvency. This information must be easily accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible, but, above all, consumers must be clearly told which authority they can apply to should they need to claim compensation. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, the legal mechanism devised as a temporary solution for adapting the value-added tax (VAT) system to the abolition of the internal borders is showing its limitations and shortcomings. There is a high level of exposure to fraud, a problem that must be solved as soon as possible. Furthermore, if we think about the considerable increase in commercial transactions between tradespeople based in different Member States and about the rise in the provision of cross-border services, reform of the VAT system appears obvious and inevitable. I voted for Mr Casa’s report, but I still believe that the reverse charge mechanism needs to be explored further. In particular, we are not currently able to forecast what the effects would be of concentrating the financial risk exclusively on the retailer. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we have been able to establish which new and important powers have been granted to the European Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Commission’s proposals for improved economic governance are crucially important for our economic growth and, in particular, for that of the countries in the euro area. The improvements made by the European Parliament with a view to the creation of a robust and coherent legislative framework are clear. I support the general approach of this report, and accordingly voted in favour of it. We have new responsibilities to shoulder; the package of measures must be further improved and enhanced. I believe that we should focus more on preventing unsustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies, but above all that Parliament should be given a prominent role in the surveillance process, with regular, systematic debates and public hearings held in Parliament itself. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what clearly emerges from this report is that many European regions find it difficult to administer the Structural Funds made available by the Union through its cohesion policies. They often find themselves caught in a maze in which, if the regions succeed in organising the administration of these funds, it is often the national governments that then find it difficult to activate the cofinancing funds. Sometimes it is like a dog chasing its own tail: the money that we consider fundamental for growth and cohesion in Europe cannot then be spent, as it now appears is happening in my own country, Italy, as well. I have therefore voted in favour of this report, but I believe that, on the one hand, we should speed up the adoption of the new economic programming period 2014-2020 to enable the individual Member States and regions of Europe to prepare themselves in time and, on the other, that the cofinancing mechanism should perhaps be reviewed. That could be a way forward and so I have voted in favour, but I think a lot more needs to be done to ensure that European funds can actually be spent to benefit the people. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report shows that the social cost of road accidents is enormous, standing at an estimated EUR 130 billion per year. Mr Koch’s proposals are along the right lines and I particularly support the idea of creating the role of EU road safety coordinator. However, I think that we do need to come up with targets and measures that are far more ambitious than those put forward by the Commission thus far; above all, I think that Parliament ought to make its presence felt to the Commission. We cannot accept the fact that in recent years, the European Union’s budget for road safety measures has been slashed. We are therefore duty-bound to ensure that this trend is reversed as soon as possible and that road safety receives greater funding. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forecasts in Mr Caspary’s report on gross domestic product and export growth in the European Union are truly disheartening. We cannot continue to plan our commercial strategy on the premise that the current situation in international trade will remain. The Global Europe strategy has been a failure and I think that the Commission ought to investigate the reasons behind this. We need critical and detailed analysis, but especially an overview of how to deal with future economic challenges. The commercial policy must be coordinated with the European Union’s other economic policies, but, above all, it needs to be accompanied by a parallel policy to combat the phenomenon of population decline. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced countless innovations, including one which in my view deserves greater attention: the Protocol on the role of national parliaments. In the Protocol, national parliaments are called upon to actively uphold the principle of subsidiarity during the legislative process. I voted in favour of this report. Nevertheless, I wish to stress that, so far, very little has been done. Applying this Protocol would meet our citizens’ need, albeit only in part, for democratic legitimacy, and overcome that feeling of remoteness which surrounds the European institutions. I think that a need felt so keenly by our citizens deserves greater attention. I therefore hope that further measures are adopted as soon as possible. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only endorse the text of this report. Mr Meyer has rightly highlighted the need to create a European one-stop shop. The creation of such facilities remains the main goal yet to be achieved. However, the statistics in the report clearly show that there is a significant lack of information at European level, not only with regard to the public’s right of petition, but also in terms of the so-called informal mechanisms. For example, SOLVIT has shown that it works properly, swiftly and effectively, but this has not changed the fact that our fellow citizens only marginally avail themselves of this service. I wonder whether it would not be more appropriate to organise a media campaign at European level on these topics instead of merely improving the Parliament website, which is an important communication tool, but which does not reach every citizen at the moment. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around half of all CO2 
emission-intensive industrial projects in developing countries have some form of export credit agency support. These projects usually present a high environmental and social risk. Moreover, it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess the scale of this phenomenon, since the agencies themselves have no data or rules on transparency of information. This situation is completely at odds with our environmental policy. I wonder whether it would not be worth looking at the scale of this phenomenon in more depth. Mandatory risk calculations are a first step. However, even clearer rules are needed in order to direct these forms of financial support towards the carbon reduction target that we have set ourselves. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by Mr Bütikofer. The EU needs a strong industrial base on which to grow, and this cannot be achieved without an adequate supply of raw materials. Once again, we are being penalised because there is no common aim at international level. How can we dream of asserting our interests when dealing with countries such as China without a cohesive European Union? I am convinced that European raw materials diplomacy is the right solution to the supply crisis. I hope that the adopted proposals will be acted on and that the role of the European External Action Service will gradually be strengthened in the near future. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union specifies that the regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework shall be adopted by the Council after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Article 312(5) requires the three institutions to work together to find a solution ‘throughout the procedure leading to the adoption of the financial framework’, i.e. prior negotiation is required. As Mr Böge stated in his report, this negotiation has not taken place. The Council asked Parliament simply for approval, with no attempt to reach a common solution. Not even Parliament’s wish for greater flexibility has been addressed by the Council. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that Parliament cannot consent to this proposal for a draft Council regulation on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013. I hope that for all future proposals, this institution’s voice will be heard, as, moreover, required by Article 312 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 The European Union, together with all the democratic institutions of the Member States, has an inescapable duty to guarantee public safety against a global phenomenon such as terrorism. This is a duty that often involves the difficult task of reconciling limitations on certain freedoms with guaranteeing safety. Most concerns arise from the civil aviation sector. Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report contributes to the discussion and joint consideration by the three institutions with a view to adopting new measures and moving forward on this task. I agree with the call to implement harmonised rules across the EU regulating operating conditions and common standards for the detection performance of scanners, which is why I fully support the work done by my colleague.

) Mr President, Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public law enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers’ interests. As we know, the regulation proposes to achieve its aims by establishing an EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws in the Member States. In the light of recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection, I agree on the need to update the legislation. By removing the irrelevant laws, we will ease consumer protection cooperation between the national enforcement authorities. I think the amendments set out in Mr Repo’s report will successfully translate our pre-established objectives into reality and improve legal certainty, so I therefore voted in favour.

Mr Wagner’s report clearly shows the importance of an integrated European energy network, in order to be able to guarantee security of supply and diversification of sources. I believe that in order to achieve these objectives, enshrined also in the recent Treaty of Lisbon, it is right to give priority to energy infrastructures, which the Commission also considers to be outdated and poorly interconnected. We must face this infrastructure deficit, and the measures contained in Mr Wagner’s report do precisely this. The difficulties and crises in bilateral relations between energy consumer countries and producer countries are further proof of the fact that we have to think to the future, to an energy policy for the European Union. Mr Wagner’s report is a first step in this direction, and therefore I have given him my support. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the significance of this report, only 19 Member States reported on core indicators. This situation does not allow us to have a clear picture of the impact of cohesion policy on the ground. I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr Mikolášik, and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one, as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies. The organisation of public debates and consultations with stakeholders, together with the submission of reports to national parliaments for opinions are further positive measures in this sense. We have to make efforts to prevent a reduction in the funding made available for cohesion policy in the next programming period. For this reason, I supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights presented by the Commission has the merit of combining the four previous directives on the subject in a single legislative instrument. I agree with the report’s objectives. It is essential to guarantee a high level of protection for consumers in the 27 Member States and at the same time take into due account the need for manufacturers, regardless of their size, to provide their goods and services to European consumers without having to deal with unnecessary legal barriers. As things currently stand, the elimination of legal fragmentation is a difficult result to achieve. Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s report also rightly expresses doubts as to whether full harmonisation could produce different effects to those expected. I therefore voted in favour, because I am convinced that it would be useful to make an amendment to the Commission’s proposal, achieving minimum harmonisation and at the same time guaranteeing a high-level service to consumers.

 My colleague Mr Casini’s report confronts and makes a positive contribution towards resolving the problems associated with interpreting and applying Rule 51 of the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. I fully share Mr Casini’s view that it did not suffice to refer to a sole interpretation and to the guidelines intended to facilitate implementation. The conditions for the application of the procedure with joint meetings of committees and a joint vote – and I am referring in particular to the criteria of ‘competence and major importance’ of the matter in question – are clear and suited to eliminating the legal uncertainties that have existed up until now. I offer my congratulations for the good work accomplished, and I hope that this report is able to facilitate the work of Parliament by means of greater use of this procedure. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 We are currently witnessing radical changes in the international order; changes to which the European Union can no longer be a mere spectator. I think the European Union should see this as a starting point and take a truly active role in dealing with both current and emerging world powers, shaking off once and for all its reputation as a political dwarf in terms of international policy. In the same vein, I agree with the need expressed in Mr Lambsdorff’s proposal for the Member States to exert pressure during discussions to reform the United Nations Security Council in order to obtain a permanent seat for the European Union. By strengthening the role of the European Union at the United Nations, we will succeed in ensuring that the EU takes a leading role in regional and global affairs. Otherwise, we shall have to keep facing up to the continuous lack of coordination of Member States’ interests on the international scene. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Despite a series of hindrances – such as the economic crisis, the persistent inability to close the gap with the United States and increasing competition from emerging countries – the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has proved that it can offer added value to European research and development. FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Looking at Mr Audy’s report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium–sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility. With a view to negotiating the future financial perspective from 2014, these measures will pave the way for the Europeanisation of research. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The data in the report by Mrs Hirsch is alarming: the youth unemployment rate is now 21%, twice the average rate of unemployment at EU level. The motion contains useful ideas and should surely be seen in a positive light, yet I am convinced that we need to provide adequate financial resources in order to properly tackle the challenges posed by the Copenhagen Process and the EU 2020 strategy, for instance through the Structural Funds and, in particular, through the European Social Fund. With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States. Without a coordinated initiative that brings together the sectors of vocational training, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market, I do not see how we can manage to ensure that we will achieve the goals of the EU 2020 strategy entitled ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’.

Mr President, the proposal for a regulation on which we are being called to vote undoubtedly has the merit of bringing together in a single text all the existing legislation relating to textile products. This regulation will make it possible to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework on the development and use of new fibres, as well as supporting the development of innovative products and encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector. I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list. While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation.

Mr President, making it easy for citizens to scrutinise how decisions are made, together with the processes, elements and resources that influenced them, helps both to ensure greater transparency and to close the gap between the European institutions and citizens, which is often discussed in relation to legitimacy and to the so-called democratic deficit in the European Union. Great progress has been made in the last few years. One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission’s 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a ‘one-stop shop’ register for lobbyists. The approval of the Stubb-Friedrich report by this House led to the creation of a joint working group. We can safely say that the results achieved by that group with regard to the objectives set by Parliament are more than satisfactory. I fully agree with Mr Casini’s report, as the transparency of political institutions is a fundamental condition of their legitimacy. This is why I have supported the proposal.

 Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon lists foreign direct investment among the matters pertaining to common commercial policy. Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has exclusive competence in this matter. Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have maintained a significant number of agreements with third countries on foreign direct investment. If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter. The adoption of measures to substitute the existing agreements is the only way to ensure a high degree of protection for investors and to ensure that their rights are recognised and guaranteed by the legal certainty of such agreements. The draft certainly moves along these lines and I have therefore voted in its favour. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

The Internal Market is without doubt the most important instrument that the European Union has to foster growth in the wake in the recent financial crisis. The millions of citizens and businesses that reap the benefits of the Internal Market must be able to exercise their rights and be able to travel, work and live freely anywhere in Europe. This is why they must also have access to effective remedies if they intend to make a claim against another citizen or business that endangers these rights. Today, the European Union has instruments in place to enable cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of judgments of national courts. However, the actual right to have judgments enforced is still lacking. Establishing an effective system for the freezing and disclosure of debtors’ assets, and stepping up cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States, are the best ways of filling these gaps. That is why I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy’s report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 325 obliges the Commission and Member States to protect the financial interests of the European Union and to combat fraud in areas where this responsibility is shared between the Union and the Member States. According to Article 325(5), the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council an annual report on measures taken for the implementation of this Article. I agree that we need to quantify in greater detail the recovery levels of funds unduly paid to the EU Member States by gathering specific data. Another important point, rightly highlighted by Mrs Ivan in her report, is the use of better investigative methods regarding fraud carried out by Member States. In this way, we can standardise counter measures throughout the European Union and determine whether similar types of fraud have been committed in other countries. This is why I have supported this report. Alfredo Antoniozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Single Market is a valuable tool for economic recovery in the European Union, particularly for the creation of new jobs. The reports regarding the Act for the Single Market are, generally speaking, contributions made by the European Parliament in the consultation process begun by the Commission with its announcement ‘Towards a Single Market Act. Fifty Proposals for improving our work, enterprises and dealings together for a highly competitive social market economy’. I think we should have put more emphasis on the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, and the stimulation of innovation and competitiveness by the lifting of bureaucratic, administrative and regulatory burdens. However, I agree with the general structure of the report and, in particular, with the measures mentioned which aim to strengthen e-commerce and the simplification of the procurement system.

 The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna was struck by a series of devastating earthquakes. Italy then applied for mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). The EUSF was set up precisely to provide help for European citizens affected by natural disasters. I therefore voted in favour of this report to ensure that the fund would serve the purpose for which it was created. This will allow Emilia-Romagna to recover both economically and socially. The region is in real need of external assistance and I am sure that any assistance that is released will be well spent. Within a few weeks, EUR 670 million will be released in assistance to the region, and the money will be used to finance rebuilding of the electricity network and infrastructure. This is certainly an important step towards relaunching the local economy, which in turn has always played a crucial role in Italian industry.

 I voted in favour of Ms Tzavela’s report and reject the call for a moratorium. I think we should recognise the potential effects of developing the use of shale oil and gas in the European Union. Energy resources constitute a source of wealth that must be utilised and are also key for making Europe a major power in the energy field and strengthening its independence. The Member States need additional sources of energy in order to free themselves from dependence on foreign energy supply. It is therefore essential to study a variety of energy sources, including shale gas. Although this is not the only solution to our energy needs, it would bring considerable benefits. The experience of the United States could be taken as a model: there shale gas has had a notable impact, causing gas prices to fall to levels much lower than in Europe. However I believe that a cautious approach should be taken since extraction of shale gas involves possible environmental risks. We must have a clear vision of the situation, weighing up the factors for and against, and above all ensuring adequate controls. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I think that the two Commissioners here should be able to answer all of our questions on the policies they are pursuing and the choices they are making. In this context, I would like to ask Commissioner Tajani whether the work he has done up to now might, as a first stage, finish up with the Commission’s role being strengthened at European level as regards industrial policy, because this is something we would really like to see.

Of course I believe that it would be worthwhile in the current situation to revitalise the Competitiveness Council, and secondly I think that a working group should be set up within the Commission to work with Commissioner Almunia on the one hand and the Commissioner for trade on the other. While the problem with Europe’s industry is definitely a problem with Europe’s industry, at the same time it is also a problem with the rules of the internal market and with policy on external relations not being sufficiently vigilant so that all kinds of goods arrive in Europe that do not comply with our rules.

 The purpose of the proposed legislation concerning the marketing and use of explosives precursors is to restrict access by members of the public to fifteen substances in high concentrations, which are dangerous because they can be used to make homemade explosives. I therefore voted in favour of Mr Mulder’s report, because I believe it could help to prevent potential terrorist attacks and consequently is a very important step to guarantee citizens’ safety. I think it is important, in the case of some categories of substance, for public access to be authorised by setting up a licence system harmonised at European level, and for other categories I think this access needs to be accompanied by reporting and traceability of suspicious transactions.

I support this report, which I see as a very important step forward.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we have had a good debate today in Parliament on the issues of industry, growth and employment, which, as the Commissioner pointed out just now, began this morning with the plenary debate with Commissioners Tajani and Andor and has effectively continued, because we talked about energy for a long time, addressing the problems faced by the automotive industry. We will now continue with a question I submitted on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and which will be discussed here this evening. We were given assurances that in December we would have a solution to this problem, and I believe that everything we voted on yesterday at the start of the session reinforces the attention Europe is paying to this issue. There is no doubt that a host of industrial activities are linked to the European steel industry: on the one hand, upstream, the steel, iron, cast iron and iron alloy industry, and on the other, downstream, all of the industries that use these products, particularly the automotive, mechanical engineering, building, piping and metal goods sectors, as well as maritime and naval shipbuilding, domestic appliances, chemicals and other sectors. To maintain an active and competitive steel industry is vital for the future of Europe and its citizens. Even by early 2000, Europe had already lost its supremacy, beaten by China to the top spot. In recent years, the European Union has chosen to invest heavily in environmental issues – and that is a choice we approve of – but this has doubtless led to rising costs in this sector, together with an increase in commodity prices and rocketing energy costs – let us not forget that in Europe, electricity costs 100 % more than in the United States – and for some Member States, higher borrowing costs. In 2007, European steel production reached an all-time high, with 406 000 workers directly employed in the sector and in related activities. During the period 2007-2011, we saw a 10.6 % fall in employment, and today the industry employs 363 000 workers. These are rather discouraging figures, particularly for 2012. The most worrying figure is the sharp decline in production in sectors closely linked to steel; in other words, automotive and construction, which last year alone recorded a fall in production of 3.2 %. Non-European imports are steadily rising. The administrative burden that European manufacturers must bear is high and gives rise to additional costs that reduce our capacity for investment in innovation and research, at times even resulting in relocation. Perhaps we should ask ourselves if, alongside the new strategy for industrial policy that the Commission has recently adopted, there is a need for sector policies, which seek to intervene on a case-by-case basis to reverse damaging trends that Europe can no longer afford. We know that the Commission is working on an action plan for the steel industry: what stage is this at? Having welcomed the CARS 2020 Action Plan, we would also like to see an operational plan for the steel industry that can be implemented immediately. It is perhaps worth considering whether policies could be introduced that would fully enable our strategic companies to respond to global competition. To be innovative, we should imagine the re-industrialisation of Europe being accompanied by a set of policies that need our support, such as research and innovation, which is an essential tool. However, I would also like to mention the need for a review of competition policy, which was drawn up in the 1990s and perhaps does not take into account the need for Europe’s economy to deal with a global market and global competition. The completion of the internal market is essential in order to bring down the cost of energy and special attention must be given to trade agreements with third countries. To conclude, we should perhaps also ask ourselves whether it is worth reinstating a Council dedicated solely to industry, returning to the situation prior to 2002. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those of us in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have submitted a question for oral answer to this Parliament, to be dealt with tomorrow afternoon. The motion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was approved unanimously, by 44 members out of the 44 who were present, and on this occasion it became clear that it would be beneficial to seek a resolution. I know that the Bureau has decided in the first instance not to accept our motion. Mr President, I would like to ask this Chamber and you if we could review this position, since we believe that Europe is currently going through extremely difficult times in many sectors, but particularly in steel and steelmaking, given that jobs in this sector fell by 10.6 % during 2011 and, indeed, there is talk of another reduction by 10.4 % this year. For this reason, I think it would be beneficial to everyone to send a signal to the Commission and to Europe if, after tomorrow’s debate, we could already think of passing a resolution in December.

I voted in favour of the report on enhanced solidarity in the field of asylum as it is a concrete commitment to guarantee suitable and effective asylum policies. The report outlines better harmonisation of protection and asylum standards and increased solidarity between Member States, which is to say, mutual assistance and responsibility sharing between Member States in order to ensure rights are promoted and respected. I agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur: practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity, and I also believe it is necessary to make use of the complementarity of EU funds.

 The new regulation on European standardisation is a satisfactory compromise reached after a year of tough negotiations. I believe that standardisation is a key step on the road to achieving the objectives outlined in the Europe 2020 strategy and to boosting the internal market. This regulation will help European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity within a constantly updated system, products will be safer, services faster and costs lower. All this is advantageous, particularly for previously under-represented small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will now be better represented and which will now incur lower costs and fewer burdens in general. The regulation does include among its objectives the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and increased transparency, as well as consumer and environmental protection. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

In December 2010, Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 were adopted, calling for a review of EU rules governing pharmacovigilance, which applied in July 2012. While the new legislation did strengthen pharmacovigilance at EU level, there are some potential weaknesses in the system in the texts on this issue that still need to be addressed. I voted in favour of the report on pharmacovigilance as it ensures stronger surveillance on the use of medicines and refines the system with regard to disclosure and notification of information to stakeholders. The legal framework is thereby now strengthened, ensuring higher levels of transparency and safety. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The issue of growth, especially in this historic period where Europe is going through a period of economic and financial crisis, is amongst the priorities on Europe’s agenda. ‘Europe 2020’ includes measures aimed at achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. To achieve the objectives set out in this strategy and to help the market unleash its full potential, modern and efficient infrastructure (in the field of transport and energy) throughout Europe is of key importance. This is exactly why I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report. It focuses on project bonds which, in addition to equity instruments and grants, help to finance new projects and obtain more private investment. For 2010-2020, EUR 1.5 trillion will be needed to build infrastructure, whereas the figure allocated in the text is EUR 230 million. There is still a lot of work to be done, but in this situation, Mr Färm’s report is a step in the right direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Within the context of the process of European integration, the creation of a single railway area is of fundamental importance. One need only recall the fact that one of the four fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based is the free movement of persons throughout the territory of the EU. For this reason, I have wholeheartedly supported Ms Serracchiani’s recommendation. There are two aspects within it which I would like to emphasise. The first relates to the creation of a network of fully independent national regulators with greater powers, coordinated by the Commission, with the possibility, in the future, of establishing a single European regulator. The second concerns the change of duration of the contract between Member State and infrastructure manager from three to five years. This change will make it possible to have better medium- and long-term guarantees for investment plans. A single railway area will permit non-discriminatory access to the market and will make our railway network stronger, healthier and more competitive. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

Roads are currently the main mode of transport within the European Union, for both passengers and freight. Freight transport by road accounts for more than two-thirds of the total tonnage. It is for that reason that I decided to vote for and support the report by Ms Ţicău, to amend the regulation on recording equipment in road transport. Tachographs have a concrete impact on the daily lives of drivers, and because of that it is vitally important to make them more efficient in order to improve road safety, drivers’ working conditions and to ensure fair competition among transport companies. Improving safety on Europe’s roads is a duty which the European Union cannot ignore. The establishment of statutory obligations for manufacturers of tachographs, authorities, transport operators and drivers, as contained in the report, does precisely this. These aspects, together with the introduction of the latest technologies, make the report an excellent point of departure for raising the level of safety on our roads. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The safety of EU citizens is one of the European Union’s main concerns. In addition to negative effects caused by failure to respect intellectual property rights having an impact on Europe’s economy, counterfeiting and piracy cost European businesses nearly EUR 250 billion annually, and damage and jeopardise the health and safety of the residents of the EU’s 27 states. I voted for the report by Mr Creutzmann because it deals precisely and clearly with an extremely important issue, by seeking to simplify the regulatory framework that currently exists, so as to make measures to combat counterfeiting more effective and rigorous. Consumer protection, facilitation of the work of customs authorities, protection of intellectual property rights and combating fraud are the keystones on which European policy in this sector must rest. We will only be able to achieve protection of the health and defence of European citizens and the EU economy through vigorous and decisive protection of intellectual property rights, and this report is an important step towards attaining this goal.

 Road safety is a subject of enormous importance, especially nowadays, when technology and developments in the automotive sector are reaching ever higher levels. The EU’s task is to adopt legislation that will enable citizens to travel on safe roads and in safe vehicles. That is why I voted for the resolution moved by Mr Koch and Ms Sehnalová on the adoption of the eCall system in all cars by 2015. The introduction of this device will bring many benefits. In the event of a serious accident, a vehicle equipped with eCall will automatically place a 112 emergency call, even if the passenger is not in a fit state to speak, and provide the emergency services with all the key information on the accident. Thanks to the use of this technology, about 2 500 lives will be saved every year and the severity of injuries sustained will fall by 10-15%, all due to the swifter and more efficient intervention of the rescue services at the scene of the accident.

 This proposal for a regulation is intended to overhaul the provisions on foodstuffs for specific nutritional uses, contained in the Framework Directive on Dietetic Products, which makes substantial reference to the 1979 standard. The proposal intends to abolish the concept of dietetic foods and set out a new framework containing general provisions for a limited number of well-defined categories of foods judged essential for some particularly vulnerable sections of the population, for example foods aimed at infants and children and foods to be used under medical supervision. Vulnerable people need greater protection than the rest of the population and must be able to benefit from a high level of legal certainty. The proposal also suggests creating a single legal act that regulates the list of substances that can be added to the food categories that are the subject of this proposal. The differences in how Member States implement the existing legislation are currently too large, causing market distortions and administrative burdens. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The EU-Latin America partnership has always been very strong, both from a cultural and a commercial standpoint. Indeed, the Union is the principal donor of development aid and the principal investor in the area. I voted in favour of the report on development cooperation with Latin America since it clearly and accurately addresses topics important to future collaboration between the EU and Latin America. At this time of economic crisis, we must enhance current EU-Latin America relations. The food crisis, the fight against climate change and social problems are challenges common to both of these areas. A positive resolution of the above issues will largely depend on the cooperation relationship that will be established in the coming years. Multilateralism and enhanced cooperation are two paths that we must embark upon with determination. Cooperating and collaborating with Latin America, by sending targeted aid, tailored to the situation and to the specific needs of each State, does not mean simply aiming to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This cooperation will also help eradicate poverty and inequality and boost economic development of the area. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted for the report on cross-border voluntary activities, which was tabled on the eve of the closure of the European Year of Voluntary Activities Promoting Active Citizenship. I believe it fills the existing regulatory gap and marks a step forward in relation to the current situation. The report sets out much-needed objectives, such as removing barriers to volunteers and thus allowing them greater and easier movement, and increasing volunteers’ knowledge in areas such as cultural heritage, sport and health. Voluntary work, which accounts for 5% of Europe’s GDP, improves the quality of people’s lives, provides considerable added value and adds to the training of young people, who can then look forward to a better career. There are currently 100 million European citizens working in voluntary activities; this is a fundamental expression of active citizenship and an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth. Voluntary work does entail costs, however, even though it is not paid, and there is therefore a need for tax exemption. Mr Scurria’s report promotes high-quality volunteering within and across national borders, and puts forward important proposals, such as creating a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps and introducing a European Skills Passport.

 The Internet is the primary information tool used by millions of people around the world every day. Its strategic significance means that the European Union should pay particular attention to it, and regulation and protection of the Internet from external attacks are subjects of extreme importance. All the countries of Europe, in conjunction with private businesses, need to make a coordinated effort to try to contain and neutralise any cyber attacks. I voted in favour of Mr Kalfin’s report because a large number of European citizens and businesses are at risk of cyber attacks every day. The report proposes effective solutions to the problem. One such solution would be to implement a global plan whereby the interaction of the governments, businesses and individuals involved would prevent cyber attacks from happening and render the Internet more secure and protected. Information security is key to European security. Europe cannot, and must not, forego the need to protect user data and intellectual property. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 The subject of energy security is vitally important in the policies of the European Union. The EU spends over EUR 400 billion on energy imports every year, and so its dependence on third countries is self-evident. Coordinating the Member States; diversifying energy suppliers, routes and sources; extending Europe’s sphere of influence beyond its borders; sharing information on energy data and projects in third countries; and developing partnerships with suppliers and international organisations are the key points on which the new European energy policy should be based. If we put these guidelines into practice alongside everything the European Union is doing in terms of energy efficiency and developing new forms of energy, we will be in a position to achieve a secure, sustainable and competitive energy policy. Much remains to be done before we have a proper common energy policy, but there is no doubt that Parliament intends to move firmly in that direction. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

The global economic crisis remains a concern for the European institutions and EU citizens. The creation of a financial transaction tax (FTT) has some significant aspects for the EU’s budget. I voted for the report by Ms Podimata because it stresses once again the constant attention being paid by the European Union to the effects of the crisis. In addition, its implementation will make it possible to generate more fiscal revenue for the European Union’s budget: approximately EUR 57 billion (two thirds of the total revenue of the FTT). It should be emphasised that the FTT needs to be applied globally, not merely at European Union level; otherwise, there would be a risk that financial entities would migrate to markets outside the EU, thus weakening the European market.

The report by Ms Sarnez is very important and topical at this time of global economic crisis. I voted for the report by my fellow Member because it sets out effectively and precisely an overview of the most sensitive and significant issues in relations between the European Union and China. Aspects such as reciprocity, the protection of intellectual property rights, transparent rules, the resolution of the trade imbalance and the formulation of rules to create a system of competition that is fair, honest and founded on a level playing field are all issues of great importance for European industry as a whole. In view of the very important part now played by the Chinese market for our enterprises, this report is a clear signal to the European institutions, with the intention that these issues should be tackled as swiftly as possible so that European enterprises may enter the Chinese market and thus take advantage of the many investment possibilities it offers.

 This own-initiative report welcomes the work carried out in order to establish a European Union internal security strategy. By virtue of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is actually entitled to take the lead on this issue, setting priorities and defining the future internal security model. I consider the work carried out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and by Ms Borsellino, to be significant. The key areas of European intervention are highlighted here and the primary objective seems to be that of achieving greater cooperation among the Member States’ courts and police, in order to tackle the threats arising from organised crime, terrorism, corruption, cybercrime and also natural disasters. I fully agree with the intention to create a common European area of freedom, security and justice and to adopt a unified strategy for all Member States. I believe that there is a great need to step up efforts in order to improve the consistency of the information and data which is used to assess the risks borne by EU bodies and to guarantee transparency in the methods used, thereby achieving the basic purpose of ensuring full protection of citizens.

The report by Mr de Jong stresses that in order to guarantee coherent and high-quality European legislation on criminal law, the three institutions must reach an agreement on principles and working methods. I am in agreement with this own-initiative report due to the serious approach that was taken in regulating such a delicate policy area. In particular, I agree with the importance given to mutual recognition, harmonisation of protection standards and the principle of the presumption of innocence. I support the creation of a common European legal culture and of a uniform and coherent strategy as well as the promotion of greater institutional coordination, while ensuring that the main areas of criminal law remain the responsibility of the Member States. The law must be extremely clear and easy to understand, which is why I agree that the European Commission should appoint a specific coordinating authority. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

I welcome the report by Ms Irigoyen Pérez, which aims to ensure equal treatment and the elimination of discrimination in the internal market and, in particular, protection of the most vulnerable consumers. This is to be achieved through a targeted strategy which consists of promoting programmes to support consumer information and education, uniform application of standards in all Member States and transparent pricing, especially with regard to e
-commerce. We also need stricter rules on advertising, which is misleading at times, and a greater control over the information given to the public in order to avoid buyers making ill-informed choices. Consumers need to be better protected when buying and they must be carefully looked after, by creating legislation on adequate, clear and precise information, which will help achieve a more transparent and competitive single market.

 Turkey is a candidate country for accession to the European Union, and is therefore bound to observe the Community acquis
 and to commit to respecting human rights, including the rights of women and gender equality, one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, these rights are not always respected in Turkey, a country where violence against women continues to occur day after day. I believe that there is a definite need for a change of course, a transformation of the patriarchal structure of Turkish society and culture. This report calls on the Turkish Government to take concerted and coordinated action to implement legislative measures on women’s rights, their education and participation in politics. Turkey does not do enough to protect women. There are still countless cases of forced or early marriages. Development of better education for all is essential when it comes to fundamental rights.

 The ITER project has a particular importance within the programme for a greener, more sustainable Europe, a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy.

The additional financing for 2012-2013 confirms Parliament’s desire to support a project that is very ambitious, much discussed, but also extremely important when it comes to striving for excellence in a sector in which the EU can take a leading role.

 Education is a fundamental aspect that must be taken into account in the process of growth, development and prosperity for the Europe of the future.

Highly skilled workers will be needed in 35% of all jobs by 2020. Actions such as widening access to higher education, the Erasmus Master’s Degree Mobility Scheme and loans for students who want to study for a Master’s degree abroad will help the national governments in this delicate process in the interest of future generations.

 The recent financial crisis has affected many EU Member States, some of which have been hit harder than others. I voted for the report by Ms Hübner and I fully support the guidelines of the text, the primary objective of which is to help and support Member States in difficulty. The above measures are crucially important in the present crisis. They will allow the implementation of important infrastructure projects of fundamental importance for Member State revenues and for maintaining jobs. In this way, the EU can guarantee its support to Member States that are in difficulty, ensure that its aid is not lost, and provide guarantees to Member States that are net contributors.

 The European Union and the United States are together in the front line of the fight against international terrorism. Close cooperation between these two political entities is a requirement for reducing any kind of threat to a minimum. The agreement reached in 2007 is an initial step towards the end goal and now the agreement signed in November 2011 introduces important new provisions, including more efficient exchanges of information and greater protection for passenger data. I voted in favour of the agreement because it will shore up the fight against various criminal activities, aid in the capture of those guilty of terrorist acts, strengthen the transatlantic partnership and ensure that passengers’ privacy and personal details are protected.

 I think we need to start simplifying and harmonising taxes across the various Member States. Having 27 different sets of rules carries a number of disadvantages: high costs and administrative burdens, social and economic distortions, risks of discrimination and, lastly, an increase in opportunities for tax evasion. That is why, despite the reluctance of some Member States, who see their sovereignty over tax issues being threatened, I have voted in favour of Ms Thyssen’s report on the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. Indeed, I am very much convinced that all Member States need to comply with the same rules if the single market project is to be completed. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Ms Lulling’s report on the taxation of energy products and electricity because I completely agree with its basic principles: aligning provisions on energy taxation with the environmental goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and reducing distortions in the internal market between EU Member States. Indeed, the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity needs to be as coherent as possible with the EU’s environmental goals. The political groups cannot reach an agreement on proportionality. I was especially supportive of Amendment 53, which aims to rid the proposal of the principle of proportionality, primarily for pragmatic reasons. We cannot allow further increases in diesel prices at a time when, for fiscal reasons due to austerity measures, the prices of energy products are under constant pressure. Furthermore, diesel is often used for work purposes and it is obvious that road haulage would suffer major negative effects as a result of regulated minimum rate increases. Lastly, the people of Europe would not be able to comprehend such a decision. Amalia Sartori  (PPE

 I support Mr Cabrnoch’s report on the coordination of social security systems because I believe that a revision, an update and a clarification of the social security conditions in the various EU Member States were absolutely necessary. These are historic times, in which cross-border mobility has become an increasingly significant phenomenon and we really need coordination in this field in order to ensure security for our citizens and their future, and, of course, legal certainty for those concerned.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with Parliament’s approval, from now on, the concept of ‘righteous’, which has always been applied to those who saved Jews from the ‘final solution’, will be the heritage of all of humanity. There have been objections from those who do not recognise Soviet communism as totalitarianism and who refuse to compare the lager
 to the gulag
, from those who prefer to ignore the massacre of the Armenians so as not to prejudice relations with Turkey, from those who think that comparing the shoah
 with other horrors of the 20th century by an extended and generalised use of the word ‘righteous’ makes it banal, and finally from those who have criticised the exclusion or inclusion of this or that example of genocide or massacre. The European Parliament has overcome these and other objections and, from now on, men and women who were brave enough, and sometimes lost their lives, opposing the abuse of tyrants of any ideology or political leaning will be recognised as heroes of human dignity and heroes in the building of the moral identity of the European people.

 Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of European foreign and security policy is especially crucial at this particular historic juncture, which is marked by an extraordinary wave of protest that has taken hold in the Mediterranean and is also spreading across the Middle East. In view of this serious crisis affecting the whole of the southern Mediterranean and now spreading into the Arabian Peninsula, the European Parliament must act as a sounding board for all these protests by ordinary people. They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes. This House wants to deal directly with the High Representative and Vice-President, Baroness Ashton, particularly because of our role in controlling the budgets of civilian and military missions under the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the common security and defence policy (CSDP). The first part of the report particularly concerns the relationship between Parliament and the other institutions, primarily the Council and the Commission, driven by the post-Lisbon approach to European politics. Another very important subject is the EU’s multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being. In this regard, I have to welcome the recent resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly granting the European Union observer status within the Security Council, thus acknowledging what the Treaty of Lisbon enshrines. We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible. The report rightly highlights the great wave of civil protest in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, and also in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, and points out events, contexts and expectations for each of these countries, as well as other subjects of particular interest, such as our strong transatlantic alliance and our hugely important relations with Russia. Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during a hearing in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, a Member asked the High Representative/Vice-President a loaded question. He said that, when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States’ isolationist stance, particularly in relation to the European Union, he replied ‘There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe’. The Member then asked Baroness Ashton, ‘Is there a foreign minister and a phone number he can call now?’ Her very British answer was: ‘Yes, I do that job, although I am called High Representative/Vice-President and not foreign minister. There is also a phone number, but it is answered by a machine saying to press 1 for the British position, 2 for the French, 3 for the German, and so on’. Baroness Ashton, you have heard the speeches by many of my fellow Members, and this message is also in my report. You have a number of voices in the world, but you listen to ours – Parliament’s – more because we always support a European policy, and not just that of the Member States, to which you reply in the Council, or that of the Commission, to which you reply in the appropriate places. I would like there to be a third place in which you could express your third loyalty. This place is in the middle of this Chamber, behind the podium, because you are the Council, the Commission and also Parliament. I believe this dialogue needs to be developed and strengthened in order to achieve democratic legitimacy for our external policy, directed and controlled by Europe’s citizens. We will help you carry out this role. Gabriele Albertini,

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years after the start of negotiations between the European Commission and Pakistan, an agreement has finally been reached on a readmission procedure for persons residing in the European Union without authorisation. The Committee on Foreign Affairs asked permission to draft an opinion on this very important agreement, particularly bearing in mind developments in the region around Pakistan and the issue of human rights. We had a lengthy debate in committee and several concerns were raised: the unstable situation and continual violations of human rights in Pakistan, as well as the fact that negotiations held with Pakistan did not guarantee the rights and safety of persons sent back to Pakistan. Also, we were worried that no evaluation of the 11 readmission agreements already in force has yet been made. In the end, the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs concluded that a clear framework for cooperation on readmission with Pakistan was preferable to a situation where there is a risk that Member States proceed to expel illegal immigrants from Pakistan on an ad hoc basis and without supervision based on the respect for human rights. Article 16 will ensure that the EU can carry out this supervision, so I reiterate the request of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for an evaluation of the agreements concluded thus far and I support its adoption.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: ‘No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. The prohibition applies in all situations and is an overriding rule of international law and, as such, applies to all states. Not only does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights impose this protection of human rights against torture but so do the United Nations Convention and the European Convention. The European Union and its Member States take these obligations very seriously. Considering also that we celebrated the International Day against Torture last week, we believe that combating torture constitutes an absolute priority for the European Union. To respect these extremely important legal and moral obligations, we therefore need to impose a close control on the trade in equipment designed to inflict torture or other inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. The moment when the regulation was adopted represented a great step forward, as was also confirmed by the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on torture. This regulation also serves as a model in terms of international legislation on the subject. The application of this regulation has not, unfortunately, been as exemplary as its adoption: only seven Member States have submitted one or more of the annual public reports laid down in Article 13 of the regulation, containing detailed information on authorisations granted for the import and export of goods that could be used for torture. These reports constitute an essential element for assessing full compliance with the regulation. Numerous questions are raised over the final use and destination of the goods when we analyse the authorisations granted. Authorities with responsibility for authorising exports must therefore carry out a more detailed political assessment before proceeding. Neither have many Member States communicated information relating to penalties applicable for infringing the provisions of the Council Regulation, as required in Article 17 of the regulation. Nearly five years after the adoption of the regulation, the list of goods identified in the Annexes to the regulation must be updated. Man can be very cruel and sometimes it seems that the human imagination for ways of inflicting suffering on others is unlimited. It is therefore of fundamental importance to keep pace with technological developments in this cheerless arena. For all these reasons, the time has come to table the question to the European Parliament and to call on the European Union and its Member States to show that they are able to keep their promises. As members of the European Parliament, it is our duty, by democratic mandate, to ensure that the institutions work responsibly. This is the reason why we want detailed information on what has been done so far to comply fully with the regulation and also on measures that will enable the situation to be improved in the future. We welcome, as a first step, the decision of the Committee supervising the application of this regulation at the end of this month. Lest we forget, Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 is not merely fine words but a fundamental and essential instrument that must now be applied in full. Gabriele Albertini,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union needs to adopt a new approach and make a joint effort when facing global challenges. The powers recently obtained due to the entry into force of the treaty mean that Parliament engages in frequent, cooperative and effective discussions with our primary interlocutor, Baroness Ashton, who has the honour of acting as the new Vice-President/High Representative for the first time. Her mandate was subject to our consensus vote in January and, on several occasions, the Parliamentary Assembly was promised that the Council and the Commission would be constantly involved in all the most important aspects of European security and defence. As the report itself confirms, the High Representative is therefore called upon to appear before the European Parliament and to consult it frequently and regularly. With the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union’s external action takes on a new and important dimension, but actually achieving this goal also depends on the European Union having the necessary budgetary resources. The European Parliament has a key role to play in its capacity as custodian of the democratic legitimacy of external action. The creation of a European External Action Service will give a diplomatic body and system to the European Union which, until now, has only been able to rely on national representation. The roles of the official representatives, whose appointment is the responsibility of the High Representative, assume great relevance and topicality. Nonetheless, as stated in the report, Parliament is calling for greater powers of ballot and control over the roles and the mandates of individual representatives, upholding the principles of transparency and merit that must guide the High Representative when appointing candidates. It is hoped that we will eventually achieve a situation of double hatting – except in the case of the special representative, whose range of action should be regional – and that we will therefore benefit from economies of scale, making the European Union’s external action more efficient and, at the same time, less costly. After an initial introductory section on strategy, the report addresses the issue of European foreign policy by theme and geographical area. The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied, especially the United Nations, the chief custodian of global security. It must play an important role, not only from the viewpoint of its seat on the Security Council, but also in terms of staff and delegations connecting the two bodies. We call on the Vice-President/High Representative to let Europe fulfil its ambition to become an active, strategic and independent partner of a great ally such as the United States in order to respond to the global challenges of terrorism, finance, and the often fraught relationships with industrial giants such as Russia, China and Japan. The report continues with a geographical analysis of what we can hope to achieve. In the Balkans, the theme of enlargement is introduced: the report praises the gradual achievement of the stabilisation process in Kosovo, where the European Union is present with the EULEX mission, but efforts must still be made to ensure that accession standards are respected for many countries close to candidacy for accession – Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the chapter concerning cooperation with the East and the Black Sea regions, the report deals with the issue of the European Union’s energy supply security and dependency. In the section on Russia, it calls for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to be signed. As far as the South Caucasus is concerned, the report calls for the territory of Georgia and its ethnic minorities to be left intact, and for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria to be resolved Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the European Union must play a stronger political role in relaunching the peace process following the Council decision of 12 December 2009. Union for the Mediterranean: resolution of the Turkey-Cyprus conflict. Asia: Afghanistan, critical period for the establishment of a new government after the elections; Pakistan’s key role in the fight against terrorism; concern over the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. Africa: positive contribution of the Somali coast defence mission. Latin America: need to create a stable and enduring partnership for relationships between the European Union and Latin America. I will listen to my fellow Members’ comments with great interest and respond to them at the end. Gabriele Albertini,  
rapporteur.

I thank my fellow Members, so many of whom have spoken, especially those who approved the key parts of the report, praising and endorsing its content, but also those who expressed criticisms and who, above all, did so in a desire to overcome the regrettably tragic instances where force has been used, and to dream of a peaceful world. A great Greek philosopher, Plato, said that only the dead will see an end to war. However, despite our refusal to bow to this philosophy and our attempts to prevent this happening, reality compels us to use force even on peace missions. I congratulate High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, and thank her for having mentioned my report: one aspect of her approach that I particularly like is its dual nature, the way it seeks synergy between the tasks of the Council and the Commission. Her very physical location – which will alternate between the benches of the Council, here, and the Commission – exemplifies her wish to wear two hats. As Parliament, I believe that we must support and promote this synergistic commitment. The European Commission pursues policies for development, neighbourhood, and for stability and the promotion of human rights and democracy; the Council undertakes peace missions and missions to implement the rule of law. This set of themes must find its ultimate expression in the European foreign diplomatic service, which must be efficient, effective, and equipped with the necessary skills and resources to be able to carry out its role as it should, and we will work hard to achieve this. I also thank the High Representative – and we will discuss this further on 23 April – for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of the external service, which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth. Today marks the beginning of our collaboration, but certainly not the end. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public opinion is divided on the Goldstone report. In particular, the Israeli armed forces are accused of having deliberately caused the deaths of countless civilians during the urban guerrilla operations. This is a very serious accusation, which appears to overlook certain undeniable facts, such as the distribution of leaflets throughout the battle zone to explain that houses containing weapons and munitions could be hit, and the telephone and radio warnings, including on Hamas frequencies, before attacks were launched on buildings identified as arms depots. The so-called ‘roof knocking’ technique was also used: if, after all those warnings, the air force still identified buildings full of people, small explosive and, above all, loud, charges would be launched to quickly evacuate the buildings. The Israeli army introduced warning signals for the Gaza civilians that no one else had put into practice before. Anyone who uses all these precautions cannot, under any circumstances, be accused of deliberately targeting civilians. Yesterday, on the same day, I met two major political figures: the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, in the morning, and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, in the evening. In both cases, the meeting was held in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and the hope expressed that, after too many decades of fighting, weapons will finally be abandoned in favour of a peace process. Just as both governments have also requested, Europe must maintain its balanced role as an impartial judge, sheltered from ideological positions that could only further inflame the feelings of both sides. Gabriele Albertini,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Monday’s vote within the Committee on Foreign Affairs provided additional evidence of the complexity and, at the same time, of the benefit of extending the geographical and political borders of the Europe that we know today. Thanks to the work and efforts of my fellow rapporteurs and the contribution of individual political groups, we have achieved a text that expands on the original and has refined many aspects that were initially only mentioned in passing. The debate in committee and also within the groups themselves was not lacking in disagreements, sometimes lively, which are typical of an across-the-board confrontation that transcends the respective political positions. Historical events within each nation and the current state of their relations were at odds with applications made by candidate countries or aspiring candidates. In less than a year, another three applications were submitted to open membership negotiations: Montenegro in December 2008, Albania in April 2009 and Iceland in July 2009. It is a sign that the European project can still boast plenty of appeal and is considered a major factor of stability, particularly following the meltdown in financial markets. The text obtained as a result of the votes within the Committee on Foreign Affairs more forcefully underlines the need for the countries who wish to join the European Union to face up to this transition conscientiously, aware of the duties and implications that this process involves. Their entry requires them to respect European parameters, not only economic and political, but also cultural, social and legal, to ensure that the end result is more than the sum of its parts. I hope that the text that the plenary session will vote on tomorrow will address all aspects of the general strategy on enlargement in a more balanced and concise way. It will obviously benefit from the contribution of specific resolutions on each country. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE
),

The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us. I am grateful to Mr Brok and to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the excellent work they have done in spite of the little time available. On the basis of this work, the committee that I have the honour of chairing will be able to conduct a constructive but firm dialogue with the future High Representative and to defend the Community character of the new External Action Service. The message that we want to send out to the Commission and the Council is basically this: we want a service that has extensive powers and which fulfils our ambitions of making the European Union a global political player, and we want this to happen on a consensual basis, that is to say, with the involvement and the support of all three institutions – Parliament, the Commission and the Council. I therefore urge the Commission to be courageous in the negotiations and to defend the Community model, and I invite the Council once again to involve this Parliament and, in particular, the committee that I chair, in the negotiations from the outset, in order to complete this crucial stage in the creation of a true European foreign policy. Gabriele Albertini  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Piebalgs. His statements just now confirm that South Stream is not Nabucco’s competitor but a further contribution to the diversification of Europe’s energy supply sources. Europe’s energy security is based on a variety of sources, routes and supply countries. At zero growth, future demand for gas is estimated at an additional 100 to 150 billion m3 
by 2020. Based on these assumptions the development of different options is imperative, and South Stream is not an alternative to Nabucco, but in fact complements it. The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco, South Stream and the Turkey-Greece-Italy interconnection (ITG). The anti-Russia debate is therefore in conflict with what we will see happening over the next few years. The European Parliament must call for pragmatism and above all consistency in the decisions that the European Union has essentially already taken: with the European economic recovery plan, with Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks, and with the second energy security strategy. The diversification of sources, routes and supply countries is the real pillar of Europe’s energy security policy and, leaving aside the political and economic interests of the various countries most directly involved, the South Stream-Nabucco challenge must be analysed with realism, not through the distorting prism of ideology but rather with a clear vision of what needs to be done. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, have to say that I had got a somewhat different impression of the conclusions of the summit from reading the newspapers from my own and other countries yesterday and the day before. This morning you, Mr Van Rompuy – and you more than Mr Barroso, in fact – have dashed those hopes and have cast doubt on a solution that had been touted in the papers and all the statements as a turning point, a new approach and a chance for Europe to rebuild and restore real confidence. I agree with Mr Barroso that it is a very important basic principle to make it clear in the various statements and in the final document that monetary stability in a modern economy can only lead to financial stability. Someone called it an historic statement; I see it as a basic premise to start from. If the state bailout fund gives the virtuous countries that have access to the fund the chance to recapitalise, then there is a real prospect, a real possibility. The term ‘possible’ dominates the final document; of course I join those who are laying a huge responsibility on your shoulders right now. In your reply, you must explain effectively and decisively whether the Member States can really put plans into action and be confident that it is not merely a general, abstract reversal of a trend that is not going well and is not enough for the markets. Everyone is said to be making do because we need to reach the end of the tunnel. I believe we are a very long way from the end of the tunnel and so, as regards putting plans into action, we had imagined that all the uncertainty of the previous year in Europe might be swept away by a real, effective decision to be reached at the Brussels Summit. Should we feel disappointed on this point? Should we wonder why it has not come true? Please tell us, Mr Van Rompuy, so we can avoid all these misunderstandings. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Swoboda for his solidarity with regard to the recent tragedies in Italy and especially for the significance he attached to the problems we are dealing with: civil harmony and the possibility that, through solidarity and the possibility of development, we can build a different Europe and a different civil society. It is clear to all of us that the debate conducted by Parliament in recent months on the intergovernmental agreement known as the fiscal compact has vindicated all political groups: I believe that the concerns we expressed have all come true. I am also sorry that the minister denies that there is a gap between austerity and development because I think that this dichotomy has hitherto paralysed our debate, as well as Europe’s development. The one-way monetary policy is not a development policy, just as a balanced budget is a bureaucratic, systematic element, but not forward-looking. The clash between austerity and development is not suited to the complexity and the needs of Europe – something we are all becoming aware of – because we are finding it difficult to move forward, which is perhaps the result of this deficiency and cultural poverty which always leads to an economic freeze. At the forthcoming summit, we must therefore develop a different policy, creating a political Europe as well as a fiscal Europe. While the Commissioner has stated he is ready for action, Parliament can only take him at his word. This is an important statement because to date, we have had to create the conditions, at least I interpret it that way, positively, even though others have taken different positions. However, we need finally to agree on a plan, a strategy able to create a political Europe, which is vital for a Europe of development. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at a time of crisis in Europe – because the debate in this House by all the groups regarding the agreement of 1 March has shown that the Community is in crisis – it is very significant that a country such as Serbia should be given the status of candidate for EU membership. I believe that it is a key moment, and I agree with the representatives of the Commission and of the Council, and with the rapporteur, that Serbia has taken many steps forward but must continue to solve problems and find uniformity with Europe. I believe this is a time of stability and a time of security for Europe and that the new relationship that Serbia is beginning to establish with Kosovo gives great hope not only to Italy, because its borders are closer, more adjacent, but also to all of Europe, which I believe has an interest in peace as a whole being guaranteed. I believe that we need to monitor behaviour, but I think all of us should be pleased about this rapprochement

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that today we have heard three speeches that bode well for Europe. They represent three programmes and three strategies. I would like to say to Ms Thorning-Schmidt that she has made a very important point, that Denmark follows Europe’s destiny. It is not just a throw-away line, it is a phrase that makes a commitment to strengthen Europe and to offer total support; to make sure, as she said at the end, that the Community method prevails. We therefore find ourselves in a very difficult situation – and mine is not empty rhetoric – as we are facing a halt in the EU development process. This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States. We have come to a standstill and are facing very difficult times, which I do not believe will lead to the possibility of development. With the intergovernmental agreement there is neither growth nor development. Therefore the commitment of the Danish Presidency is to prevent all this from happening. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel I need to express how I feel, which is both dismayed and concerned. I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose. We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other. There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament. Therefore I believe that we must do justice to this and take into account the fact that, as has been said, the Commission must guarantee the Treaties. The Commission therefore …  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, I followed this morning’s debate and I have to say to the Polish President that what emerged showed far greater consensus than dissent. I personally belong to the group of people who expressed consensus and I would like to underline a very important part of the Polish President’s speech which yesterday provoked very lively discussion: You said, with regret, that the intergovernmental approach tends to take precedence over the European Community approach. The European Community has not seen the kind of development that we imagined for some years now, and the intergovernmental approach – as President Barroso clearly explained yesterday – paralyses the momentum which EU law would otherwise have achieved over the past few years. The prevalence of EU law is at odds with an intergovernmental approach which fails to give rise to that hope, that potential in Europe, which you, as President for the past six months, have helped to create. Taking everything into account, we do not think the summit had either negative or positive conclusions, but left us with questions which will find answers in March. I think your Presidency has somehow prevented the fall of Europe, and we hope things will continue to develop in that vein in the year ahead. Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the comments made by Mr Casini, but in the committee meeting, I tabled various amendments in the – very modest, but I believe very correct – belief that they improved the text. Those amendments were not accepted because there was a discussion, which was also held at a high level, with you in attendance, and hence an agreement had already essentially been reached. I am tabling two oral amendments, one of which I consider to be very important because, as the Article states … I would like all the Members to listen to me for a moment, because I believe there is a problem … Two minutes … Do I have to speak later? May I continue?  (The President cut off the speaker) Giuseppe Gargani  (PPE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I refer both to this amendment and to the next one, because I have tabled two oral amendments. I believe that this one is very timely and integral to the overall text, because the Article spells out the duties of MEPs in the text, in the introduction, but it is very muddled and actually stipulates what cannot be done, not what MEPs must do in accordance with what Mr Casini said about our transparency and our representation of the people, whom we must represent in a correct and very scrupulous manner. I believe that it is very muddled. I would place even more emphasis on the other amendment, Mr President. Since we are stipulating that MEPs must not accept gifts worth more than EUR 150, my amendment, ladies and gentlemen, was far stricter in proposing a much lower amount, because I believe that MEPs should not accept any gifts or courtesies save for those of little, or negligible, value. I believe that the proof of this is in a letter received by all the MEPs. This letter provides for, offers MEPs EUR 100 to take part in a survey. I believe that this is an offence against …

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like us to recall what the European Union budget really is. The budget is not additional to national budgets, and to believe so would be to continue to conduct this debate on false premises, with the risk of fragmenting our efforts. The EU budget is synthetic and has the aim of multiplying the effects of the investments made by the individual Member States. It therefore creates more efficiency and effectiveness. Resources that are removed from the EU budget raise national public expenditure: this is the underlying principle on which he have built the Union. If the EU is seen as an additional entity to the Member States, just as the EU embassy in non-EU countries is additional to all of the national embassies, then we are misleading ourselves. Therefore to believe that by saving in the EU budget, we are contributing to general saving and austerity is an unpardonable error. Instead, what we manage to achieve with the EU budget is to allow individual states to make savings, to lower expenditure and encourage austerity. If we cannot acknowledge this fact – due to the sort of ‘soft’ nationalism every state has to show to its own public opinion – the result will be that we are constantly reducing the EU budget, which will always result in increases in the national budgets. In the end the individual Member States will spend the EUR 140 billion in any case, but with diminished efficiency, because the studies carried out by the Commission already show us that each euro yields 95 cents in the EU budget but only 50 cents in the national budgets.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although I believe that things are a bit better, the impression after this Council is that a sort of ‘Penelope’s shroud’ principle is being applied and we are being asked to return again to matters that we thought had been concluded. I would therefore ask in regard to the single supervisory mechanism, which is certainly a good compromise, what the Commission intends to do to put pressure on the Member States pushing for its entry into force to be postponed. What is going to be done to ensure that they adopt more reasonable positions? As many wise leaders have observed, time is money. We must acknowledge that some countries want more time, but not enough attention is being paid to the fact that we seem to be postponing indefinitely the adoption, and the final implementation, of any decision. In other words, I believe that the results achieved by the Council should be viewed positively, but I also believe that all possible efforts should be made to ensure that these results take immediate effect.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a minute is hardly enough to make a comment, but it may be enough to give a mark, and today I would like to give the President of the Commission top marks for the realism and vision he has shown. I say realism because not everyone acknowledges the mistakes that were made in constructing the euro, and doing so may help to rebuild confidence. I say vision because the path to a federal route, albeit one of nation states, is not the end of federalism but the beginning. I would now like to make a remark to Mr Farage about his fierce attack first on Mario Draghi and then on Mario Monti.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is a good opportunity to have an objective discussion on Kazakhstan and the important agreement the country is negotiating with the EU. Kazakhstan is crucial for the stability and strategic future of Central Asia and is without doubt an important economic and trading partner for the EU. The country has already launched a process of economic and democratic reform, although much remains to be achieved in these areas. However, the country has shown itself to be committed to further and more far-reaching reforms and I think that the duty of the EU is to support this process. To this end, I am certain that the signing of this enhanced agreement will allow progress to be made, because it will strengthen an already solid and productive relationship and ensure constant assistance from the EU. I am also convinced – and I think that this should have been underlined more clearly in the report to be voted tomorrow – that greater progress in the areas of democracy and human rights should be met by renewed reciprocal efforts that are both open and constructive. Our aim should not be to place ourselves on a negative footing with this or that country if change is not achieved immediately, but rather to support the efforts by these countries to attain the objective of respect for the principle of human rights.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my appreciation for the adoption of this report that, once again, draws the attention of the European Union to the protection of health and to the protection of citizens. With this report, we have, in fact, re-addressed the issue of surveillance of medicinal products, following the adoption of Directive 2010/84/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 amending the directives on pharmacovigilance. Since the so-called Mediator case, indeed, there has been a need to address the shortcomings identified by the tests conducted in this regard, and to refine the existing system, especially with regard to information requirements and notification of stakeholders and to the list of medicinal products subject to strengthened pharmacovigilance. The amendments introduced, although modest in their scope, complement and reinforce the legal framework outlined previously in favour of greater transparency and efficiency and improved product safety standards, thus benefiting the health of European citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Seeber’s report is Parliament’s contribution to the preparation of the ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe’s water resources’, in which the Commission will be taking stock of what has been achieved since the Water Framework Directive, which has been one of the main pillars of European water policy since 2000. We voted for this report, which casts light on the challenges to be faced and the gaps to be filled, particularly in relation to the target of sustainability in terms of ecological, chemical and quantitative ‘good status’, which the framework directive says must be achieved by 2015. Among the measures suggested are the mainstreaming of water issues in all EU policy areas; the development of a holistic approach that examines all water uses and their implications; promotion and support for efficiency and sustainability in the management of this basic asset; and the achievement of water supply security, not only regionally but also internationally.

 The proposal for a regulation in question, updating Directive 2009/39/EC in line with legal and market developments, has raised questions over the classification of many products as ‘dietetic’, establishing general provisions for only a limited number of food categories considered essential for certain vulnerable population groups – foods aimed at infants, children and patients under medical supervision. At the same time it has shifted protection for other groups (coeliacs and people who are lactose-intolerant) to other EU legislation and mechanisms. The positive vote on Ms Ries’s report – the outcome of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – is a clear sign and a positive starting point for the coming negotiations. On one hand, it expresses the shared wish to simplify the regulations; on the other it draws attention to the need to reintroduce in the future regulation complete protection for the specific nutritional needs of all the most vulnerable groups of consumers.

 The violent flooding which hit Liguria and Tuscany in October 2011 severely damaged infrastructure, transport networks, businesses, agriculture and residential homes. Faced with this disaster, Italy requested mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund, established in 2002 precisely to provide assistance to disaster-stricken regions. Our vote in favour of Mr Fernandes’s report will enable the fund to be mobilised – for the first time this year – for a total amount of EUR 18 061 682 for the Italian regions concerned. The importance of all this will be two-fold: as practical assistance with physical reconstruction, and as a symbolic gesture that will remind all Europeans of the value of solidarity, one of the cornerstones on which the European Union is founded.

 Mr President, Ms Irigoyen Pérez’s report, which we have voted to support, concerns the need to consider developing a strategy to protect the rights of the most vulnerable consumers, in light of the strategy that the European Commission and the Member States will be required to devise to that end. Consumers may be vulnerable for various reasons, and potentially anyone may be affected. That is why this group of consumers, along with consumers in general, needs to be protected. A targeted strategy is required that considers the problem in the round while, on the one hand, avoiding creating new forms of discrimination and, on the other, eschewing static, rigid definitions that are unable to embrace all the facets of the matter and the various possible kinds of vulnerability. Specific, targeted protective measures are therefore needed. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Søvndal for his thorough description. First of all, I, too, would like to express our total support to the families of the victims of the serious clashes that took place on 16 December in Zhanaozen, and our concern for the subsequent unfolding of events. What was initially essentially a labour dispute degenerated into extremely serious incidents in which 17 people lost their lives and, in the days following the incident, led to the arrest of journalists and representatives of the opposition. It is in everyone’s interest, as Kazakhstan has done, to shed full light on the events and I therefore hope that today will be remembered solely as an opportunity for our Parliament to explore what has happened thus far, and to reiterate our call for an investigation that will reassure the international community that the responsibilities for the events of Zhanaozen will be clarified and those responsible pursued in the utmost respect of the principles of the law and respect for human rights. The delegation that I have the honour of heading has had the opportunity of hearing the explanations provided by the Kazakh authorities at some of its meetings, as well as those of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are very active in monitoring events in the country. The willingness of the authorities of Kazakhstan to provide explanations and the promise to provide further clarifications are undoubtedly positive elements and should be appreciated by us all. This is another reason why I would like to underline the need to maintain a certain balance, which I would have liked to have seen play a bigger part also in the text of the resolution on which we will have to vote tomorrow, and which, in my opinion, it would perhaps have been better to have postponed until the official investigations were over. It would also have been useful to send an official mission of international bodies to flank the investigations. The undeniable need to further clarify what happened and to call for greater efforts on the part of Kazakhstan in improving its progress along the road to democracy must also be accompanied at all times by a new commitment to an open and constructive dialogue with the country.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at such a difficult time for Europe and after the blocking of the proposal at the Council and the tabling of a new amended Commission proposal, the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union is undoubtedly a positive act. It is a useful compromise that has resolved many of the issues that caused the impasse
, such as the full financing of the scheme by the European Union, with the participation of the Union in the distribution point programme, an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million for the Union’s financial contribution, the notion of the Union origin of the foods that are then distributed and the requirement for the purchase of food products to be made on the basis of competitive procedures. The scheme will therefore be operational from 2013 and will allow the supply of food products from reserves deriving from intervention in order to benefit the most deprived persons in the Union, thus also achieving one of the most important objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP). Today’s vote in favour is the culmination of this report’s complex and difficult path, and is an important sign of the Union’s support for its most deprived citizens. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the increase in intellectual property infringements observed in recent years threatens to undermine the strategy on intellectual property rights in the single market that was launched by the Commission in May 2011. To combat such infringements and ensure the success of the intellectual property protection policy, it has been proposed that the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market be entrusted with certain tasks relating to the running of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, set up in 2009. The purpose of this is to provide the Observatory with the human and financial resources to combat intellectual property infringements and to conduct campaigns to raise public awareness of the risks of buying counterfeit products. Our adoption of the report therefore marks a very important moment in the fight against the trade in counterfeit goods and in defence of innovation, growth and the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the jobs and security of the people of Europe.

 Four years after it was first introduced, the European Parliament is examining the status of implementation of the EU strategy for Central Asia. In the light of major developments in Europe and the world, the EU has summed up its achievements in its relations with this part of the world. This report underlines the need for a new approach focusing on strengthening long-term cooperation and a mutual strategic commitment in order to deepen the political, social and economic relations. The text also highlights the need to maintain a high level of commitment in all areas of society, thanks also to more financial resources, funding and programmes. Furthermore, the report draws attention to the institutional value of the partnership and cooperation agreements (PCAs) as the basis for exchanges with these countries and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committees as tools that can guarantee a regular platform for strengthening bilateral relations with countries in Central Asia. To sum up, the new strategy has a fundamental role in the creation of increasingly stable cooperation with this sensitive region, with which dialogue and the mutual exchange of knowledge will guarantee ambitious results in terms of economic cooperation, the promotion of development and defence of human, social and cultural rights.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenges posed by the modern age and by Mr Triantaphyllides’s report, for which we have voted in favour, dictate that citizens in their capacity as consumers should be placed at the centre of the EU debate, and they remind us that the safeguarding of citizens’ interests cannot remain a principle sanctified at the level of treaties, but should be a concrete and inspiring principle of EU politics. Protected and informed consumers, who are made more aware and are therefore in a position to take full advantage of the instruments and resources at their disposal, as well as to make full use of their rights, should be the final aim of the EU’s new strategy on consumer policy. This strategy should therefore be established as an approach with ample breathing space, and it should be all-encompassing, so that it can move freely from the sector of financial services to that of food, from the safeguarding of minors to advertising, and, therefore, be in a position to make an important contribution to Europe’s social and environmental objectives.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme, for which we voted in favour, is based on a measured, realistic approach which, on the one hand, has refrained from laying down impractical requirements that are impossible to meet, and on the other, has provided for a so-called flexibility scheme. By laying down stages and corresponding quantitative limits of permitted emissions, this scheme provides for the placing on the market of a pre-established annual quota of tractors meeting certain characteristics, and thereby enables the manufacturing and industrial sectors concerned to adapt to the pre-established standards gradually, without causing them disruption. Mr Tatarella has produced an important piece of work and has managed to strike a careful balance between the requirements arising from the major challenges which the EU needs to tackle at this time, and the requirements relating to environmental protection and the present economic crisis.

 Mr President, in recent years, the current global economic crisis, which is even worse than the Great Depression, has caused unsustainable imbalances in international economies. The commercial disparities between countries, financial markets lacking common rules, and the instability of the banking system all constitute a potential threat to financial and economic stability. This resolution, which I support, stresses the urgent need for total reform, with new rules and global economic coordination. The economy needs a system of global governance, open markets, high economic and social standards, a more responsible monetary policy and more stringent supervisory policies; decision-making bodies and international economic bodies must be the main stakeholders driving this new approach. In particular, Europe needs a clear and transparent framework to reduce the instability that has been aggravated by, among other things, globalisation, and to guarantee wide-ranging reforms aimed at fostering growth and reducing the debt of individual Member States. This is the demand that the current resolution highlights to all the countries. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent years, we have seen an increase in the number and intensity of natural disasters, which have become increasingly global in scale, with disastrous consequences. A genuinely European response to such disasters that involves, and is binding on, all the various levels of government in which the European Union is structured is crucial to address this scenario. Ms Gardini’s valuable report, which I voted for, highlights the importance of a simplified and rationalised Civil Protection Mechanism that is more extensively and effectively coordinated at a political and operational level and is not encumbered by red tape. It must allow for the pooling of resources and skills and the optimisation of existing assets without increasing the financial burden in times of austerity. Greater attention to cross-border and geographically vulnerable areas and implementation of a culture of prevention will complement this new approach to ensure a rapid, speedy and effective response to any future needs.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Fidanza on the report he has drafted, which fits logically into the framework of actions undertaken and promoted at Union level relating to tourism, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Union new powers in this field. I must stress the fact that I endorse the statement about the importance of Europe as a single destination for certified, quality tourism, as well as the intention to promote this idea by turning it into actions in terms of structures, allocation of resources, funding, and coordination of actions among the various levels of government in the countries of the Union. This is an approach to be valued and rewarded, given that the sector in question – with its implications in terms of the percentage of GDP produced, employment and new opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, and emphasis on environmental protection and enhancement – is in a position to develop and thus to respond to the major challenges of today. For all these reasons, I believe this report is positive, as it sends out an important signal for the promotion of a European tourism policy. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the disaster that struck the Gulf of Mexico more than a year ago has prompted the European Commission to reflect on legislation relating to offshore oil activities. The European Parliament, too, wished to express its position on the matter, with this report. It has adopted a text that calls for the sector’s operators to have adequate technical and financial capacity and which aims to establish high safety standards so as to confirm the European Parliament’s leading role in promoting the safety of offshore activities. The new measures requested of the Commission in this regard will have to focus on international coordination and on a realistic approach that combines all of the quality procedures that exist in the sector and prevents the creation of new bodies or additional red tape, which could well delay the achievement of specific final objectives. In concrete terms, the report demands an improvement in communication and information and knowledge sharing mechanisms, in addition to greater accountability on the part of companies operating in the sector, and calls for the role and powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency to be strengthened and expanded. For all these reasons, I believe that the result achieved thanks to the negotiations on this text, for which we voted, is a positive one. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 As shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and as I have therefore followed this subject particularly closely, I feel I must congratulate Mrs Jordan Cizelj on the invaluable work she has done. Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations, due not least to the highly sensitive international context, the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent, harmonised legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely, no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future. I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies. The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards; greater attention to technical and scientific advances, particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility; increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people’s health; and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, with transparency and with the role of licence holders.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the delegation for relations with Central Asia and Mongolia, which I am honoured to chair, went to Mongolia just three weeks ago on the occasion of the eighth interparliamentary meeting of the European Parliament and Mongolia. It was a very useful and interesting experience. Mongolia is a country that deserves to be better known and there are not many opportunities in this Parliament to give it the attention that it should certainly receive. It is a country characterised by a multi-party parliamentary system, separation of powers, comparatively free public opinion and a level of human rights protection that stands out compared with the situation in many other countries in the region. It is also a country with development problems that is grappling with a difficult environmental situation and ongoing desertification. It has also been hit by extreme weather conditions recently. At the same time, it is very rich in natural resources – copper, gold, uranium and rare earths – which could attract a considerable influx of capital in the not-too-distant future. For all the above reasons, I think it is important to send out a signal of support for Mongolia at this crucial stage in its development, and to foster the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law as well as parliamentary control, so that the financial resources that become available to Mongolia can be used in future for the benefit of the people. We have to encourage Mongolia in its desire to develop closer relations with the European Union and urge it to adopt our standards and industrial regulations. We should help it move towards a market economy and more intense economic and trade relations, which are made possible by a climate of legal certainty and the development of the rule of law. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that the European Union and Mongolia are concluding will play a decisive role in this context. For all these reasons, 45 other Members and I have tabled this oral question. In this question, we ask the Commission to provide further details on the main characteristics of the agreement and the foreseeable schedule for its ratification. I would like to point out that the agreement has already been initialled, but there is currently deadlock over its signature, apparently because of doubts raised by a Member State on the legal basis used for some of the clauses. Additionally, we would like to ask the Commission about the possibility of opening a European Union delegation in Ulaanbaatar in the near future. Such an initiative could, in fact, significantly contribute to a further deepening of our political and economic cooperation with that country. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, the report on the labelling of textile products which we endorsed today marks an important step towards simplifying legislation for the benefit of consumers and all the European manufacturers working in the industry. With this regulation, we are laying down new rules on labelling in the textile industry; we are focusing increasingly on innovation in the sector and on speeding up the integration of European legislation, in order to benefit from innovative products safely. The text proposes, in fact, to combine the three directives on the labelling of textile composition into a single European regulation, simplifying the existing regulatory framework and improving the transparency of procedures. Therefore, we cannot help but applaud the positive result achieved today in safeguarding European production. At the same time, however, we cannot fail to mention the indication of the country of origin issue. We hope that a further step forward can be taken soon with the approval of legislation regulating indications of origin in this sector as well. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of providing adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power plants has already been tackled by European Union legislation on the safety of the nuclear sector. Today, in the light of recent international events and the consequent decisions of the governments of the Member States in this regard, the issue is highly topical. We have expressed our backing for Mr Marinescu’s work, which deals with the specific cases of a number of countries which, upon accession, took on particular obligations on decommissioning nuclear power plants and received special support from the European Union for this very activity. Specific cases aside, on this issue we are duty-bound to establish an effective monitoring system to check and test the nuclear plants within EU territory. Indeed, the number of reactors that are thought to need to be decommissioned in EU territory in the near future is rather high. It will therefore be essential – including and above all in such cases –, to ensure the provision of guarantee mechanisms for setting aside adequate financial resources required to tackle both ordinary and extraordinary requirements.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of the report by Mrs Rivasi is the result of an assessment of the management of H1N1 influenza in 2009-2010 which aims to set general standards of conduct that would apply in any future global health emergency. Following a long and successful revision phase, the report makes cooperation, independence and transparency its core principles. It calls for greater and improved cooperation between the health authorities of the Member States and European institutions, in order to address harmonised and commensurate risk management. Its objectives are a change in the strategy of Member States regarding their national plans for the management of influenza, including stocks of vaccine, the publication of the names of all the experts consulted by the European health authorities, and an efficient relationship of trust with the media responsible for disseminating public health messages. That is why we voted in favour of it. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, the problem of falsified medicinal products is one that is having an ever greater impact at international and EU level, in terms of the increased number of cases as well as the advances in the development of these products. These are the challenges to which Mrs Matias’s report – the outcome of long and painstaking negotiations – sets out to respond. The report, for which we expressed our support, has established a regulatory framework which, taking as its basis more precise and detailed definitions, took into account all the actors, stages and aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain – safety, traceability and obligations of the distribution chain – in order to achieve a good compromise. These are some of the issues on which we must try to work in order to achieve the main goal of establishing more stringent standards and to prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, thus achieving a positive and more comprehensive regulatory framework that safeguards the health of citizens, protecting them from the risk of serious consequences.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, neurodegenerative diseases, and Alzheimer’s disease in particular, are an EU health priority. The disease in question has serious consequences for sufferers, and not just in health terms. The costs incurred for direct and informal care are, in fact, high. Indeed, Alzheimer’s disease affects not only the sufferers, but all those who care for them, too. Therefore, we need a European response to the problem, a coordinated response by all the Member States, a synergy of concerted measures that concern, in particular, the fields of science and research and that are responsible for strengthening prevention and diagnosis so as to improve the treatment – including innovative treatment – available, as well as the dissemination of information among the Member States on the results achieved nationally, thereby raising public awareness of the disease.

 Council Directive 1999/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens under various systems of rearing with the added objective of protecting against unfair competition among producers in the different Member States. Although I support the principles of this directive, it must not be taken lightly that, as things stand, a great many European producers – having begun the process of converting their facilities – have run into real problems in completing the transformation and risk not being ready before 1 January 2012, the final deadline for complying with the directive. If we also bear in mind the real difficulties faced by many producers in obtaining financing to support conversion processes and the serious economic difficulties that they are still having to deal with today – with serious repercussions on the stability of their businesses and employment levels – I am convinced that something has to be done. Member States should intervene to promote measures that can help European producers in the poultry farming sector who, aiming to adapt to the new European legislation, have embarked on the process of converting their facilities but are very unlikely to complete it before the start of 2012.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by Mr Fjellner aim to integrate and complete the existing European Union regulations on the subject, bringing them up to date and making them capable of tackling the challenges that technological development has created and poses for public health. In our opinion, at its centre is the patient and his or her right to be informed and have access to scientific information, which has now become both qualitatively and quantitatively better and must be monitored, starting with a more precise and accurate distinction between scientific information and advertising. Indeed, the reports use precise and standardised criteria to establish the types of information to be provided, which data are optional or not, as well as the channels through which they may be made available, thereby setting out the obligations of pharmaceutical companies and Member States. Based on this understanding, we express our support for this report, recognising its merits not only in terms of health but also in social terms. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I would like to express my appreciation for the important contribution that this work will make in identifying a set of measures to be taken to overcome the current crisis and prevent the possibility of further crises. After the limits of a system of self-regulation were highlighted to a worrying degree by the recent financial crisis, it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to choose a global control system. The current phase of economic and financial instability, the most severe for decades, has led to an employment and social crisis on such a scale that decisive action is required to eliminate its negative repercussions and prioritise the opportunities that open up in a globalised economy. The crisis in recent years has sorely tried most of the advanced economies. Recovery is still slow for some countries even today, and the ongoing fragility of financial markets makes global coordination and the choice of appropriate economic and industrial strategies key aspects in combating the financial crisis. Global supervision should, in fact, promote the stabilisation of solid financial markets and sustain the current recovery, guaranteeing strong growth in demand and employment levels.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measure sets out to reinforce and rationalise the system of pharmacovigilance in the European Union: these are the ambitious goals set by the McAvan reports, which aim to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Directive 2001/83/EC respectively. Thanks to a close and effective working relationship between the European Council and Parliament, and between the parliamentary committees responsible for this area, we have reached the point where we are able today to discuss a proposal that aims to improve the EU pharmacovigilance system, and to conclude the consistent work that the European Union has carried out in this field over more than a decade. Simplification, transparency and rationalisation may be considered the key points of these two reports, which propose measures aiming to guarantee the best possible protection of public health on the basis of standards that are harmonised throughout Europe. Reference is made to an extensive series of actions, ranging from better definition of the roles and responsibilities of the main national and international stakeholders seeking to ensure a new, more informed and active involvement of patients, who are given a fundamental role in the system, to the increased transparency of information concerning the safety of medicinal products and the simplification of activities involved in communicating, recording and evaluating suspected adverse reactions. The current pharmacovigilance system must also be improved through closer cooperation at European, national and regional levels. Effective participation at all three of these levels will, in fact, ensure a profitable exchange of information on the side effects of medicinal products. When reorganised as a network, with Internet support, the new pharmacovigilance system will be able to ensure a high level of information sharing and security to benefit patients, national authorities and healthcare professionals.

 Thank you Mr President and excuse me. With my speech, I would like to highlight how the progressive erosion of European farmers’ incomes, despite growing profit margins for the agro-industrial sector, is causing a worrying economic marginalisation of agricultural workers, with the consequent abandonment of agricultural activities. This requires, therefore, a change of course, which the European Commission itself recognises and which the report being examined and put to the vote in Parliament this morning – for which I would like to express my support – highlights with ample explanations and suggestions on a legislative and departmental level as well. Indeed we must combat global speculation on commodities and guarantee the security of supply. Moreover, greater price transparency must also be guaranteed, not only to give farmers justice and dignity, but also to correct the serious imbalances that exist with regard to bargaining power and to prevent abusive practices between the various operators. Agriculture must be confirmed as a sector of economic and social stability and it must regain power in the European and in the globalised commercial context. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge of preventing pollution from industrial emissions is a very current problem that involves a number of areas, including, of course, environmental protection, public health and the competitiveness of businesses. Precisely in order to have an integrated approach to these important areas, the directive in question was specifically aimed at facilitating the implementation of the best available techniques for controlling emissions, with harmonised EU standards for the authorisation of industrial facilities being developed in order to protect the environment, which is frequently threatened and compromised by industrial emissions. However, it does all this while also taking account of the need, which is shared by our industries, to maintain the competitive edge that is necessary to overcome the challenges of the future. A significant political commitment and intense and patient mediatory action were required on this issue. Thanks to this action, we have finally been able to reach agreement at the third trialogue. For these reasons, I would like to express my support for this report. Paolo Bartolozzi,

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight that the situation in Kyrgyzstan reflects a reality which, for too long, has not been given the importance it deserves. The reality I refer to is the instability in Central Asia, which is unfortunately increasing, while hopes for democracy and economic progress, at least in many of these countries, are especially fragile. In recent months, Kyrgyzstan has suffered as a result of harsh conflicts that will leave a legacy of interethnic strife, at least in the immediate future, making the stabilisation of that country even more difficult than it was in the past. As has already been said, the role of the international community and of the European Union in particular is to aid Kyrgyzstan as much as possible in three ways: firstly, by providing immediate aid for emergency supplies and rebuilding the damaged homes; secondly – as regards the European Union within the framework of the Central Asia strategy and the instruments implemented in that context – by providing financial aid that is as long term as possible; and, thirdly, by providing political support to aid the process of restoring constitutional order and the development of the rule of law. The constitutional referendum held in Kyrgyzstan on 28 June, in what were clearly very difficult conditions, may be regarded as the first step on the road to restoring constitutional order. The elections of 28 June also received the approval of the OSCE observation mission, which obviously took into account the special conditions in which the referendum was held. The new constitutional order in Kyrgyzstan will be directed more towards a parliamentary system than a presidential system. This will perhaps allow for greater recognition of the various ethnic groups in the country and of the need to obtain the consensus of the various groups in such a divided and composite country. The European Union and Kyrgyzstan are bound by a partnership and cooperation agreement that provides for regular meetings by a parliamentary cooperation committee. Our hope is that our inter-parliamentary relations will resume as soon as possible, with the participation of a democratically elected Kyrgyz parliament. As has already been said, in the immediate future, Kyrgyzstan needs stability and our political and financial support: let us not stint on either. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is being asked, as we know, to express a definitive opinion on food information to consumers. I should start by saying that this has unquestionably been a difficult, long and controversial legislative process, which could not have been shortened. The aim, in fact, is to harmonise European food legislation through regulations that will make information to consumers transparent, thereby preventing a situation in which they are led to make confused choices or choices that may even be harmful for their health. The report by Mrs Sommer, who must be thanked for her efforts in bringing together a large number of requirements, is therefore intended to provide a solution to the controversies and the differences between the consumer information systems in force in the Member States. It is not by chance that national regulations still differ in terms of how to describe the nature of foodstuffs for sale, creating a system that differs from one country to the next and also fuelling unfair competition, to the detriment of potential consumers. On the basis of the European Commission proposal, an attempt is therefore being made to revamp the current legislation by involving both the food industries and consumers. At the same time, the report obliges the European food industry to introduce some clarity into mandatory labelling, as well as the labelling and presentation of the nutritional value of foods. In a globalised market, the European Union could not escape the need to adapt and reform legislation on food products in order to protect the food trade, among other things, and to safeguard it from increasingly invasive and uncontrolled international competition. There is nothing new about the fact that we are hearing more and more about the dangers posed by food products that surreptitiously carry designations and statements that often do not meet dietary requirements but are nonetheless passed off as products that are good for human health.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the popular unrest that has broken out in recent days in the capital of Kyrgyzstan has halted the progress of the ‘Tulip Revolution’ that kindled hopes of democratic change in the former Soviet republic in 2005. The European Parliament is following the development of the political crisis in the country with great concern. This is not merely because of the country’s crucial geostrategic position for Russia and the United States, but also because the stability of Central Asia, its political and economic development and interregional cooperation is of interest to the EU, not least, due to the importance of Central Asia for our energy supplies and our economic and trade partnership. The risk of civil war breaking out and of a ‘second Afghanistan’ must be averted. We put our faith in the diplomatic mediation that the Presidents of the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan – the latter in his capacity as the current president of the OSCE – are deploying in their negotiations with the interim Kyrgyz Government for the establishment of public order and constitutional legality, in order that free elections can be held and the country’s problems resolved. As Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation, I hope, even despite the recent ethnic clashes, that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan.

The issue of an agricultural product quality policy has found an authoritative and unanimous response from the European Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thereby making the existing legislation more complete. European agricultural producers have finally gained recognition in European legislation on the quality of their produce linked to the region of production. This represents a guarantee for sheltering them from market globalisation and for ensuring that the ‘informed’ consumer can reject produce that does not bear the obligatory geographic indication of origin, that is not certified clearly, and that does not comply with marketing and anti-counterfeiting rules. Consumers will be able to make their purchasing choices in full knowledge of the rules relating to their desired product. The European Parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers. The health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former. An amendment of mine on the protection of product characteristics, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved, recognises that the regions have an essential role as producer partners, in particular, of the producers of traditional and organic products, and calls for regions to be involved in the recognition and promotion of products with a geographical indication, traditional products and organic products. I am pleased to note the recognition of this indication. Paolo Bartolozzi  (PPE

I congratulate the European Commission on having submitted to the Council the amended regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union. The report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up-to-date way, and does so for two reasons. The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively. The report is in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, in which particular attention is paid to energy policy by means of the strengthening and coordinating of its methods and of the investments required for the sector. The Copenhagen Summit’s failure to satisfy the world’s political leaders means that the policies to be pursued require a change of strategy. The European Parliament is paying particular attention to the problem with the aim of overseeing energy investments in the construction, transport and storage of associated energy products, so as to satisfy the production and distribution industries and hence safeguard consumers’ health. The second reason is that, since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand – like imports – is growing every day, EU energy policy must focus on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency.Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Donskis’s report on the European Union’s policy on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2011 for a number of reasons. The report highlights the importance of international humanitarian law (IHL), and particularly urges the EU to take a stronger stance in implementing IHL and considering it when entering into bilateral agreements with third countries. Not only is it important that the EU respect human rights, but we should do everything possible to ensure that basic standards of human rights are upheld in countries throughout the world, which the report directly encourages. Additionally, I support the inclusion of women’s rights in the report, as establishing human rights relies upon establishing equal rights between the sexes. Barbara Matera,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I have drafted an opinion for Mr Ferreira’s report on small-scale and artisanal fisheries. There are still too many legal and social obstacles preventing women’s full participation at all levels in the fisheries sector. Women work on fishing boats and are involved at all levels of the production chain: in fish capture, in breeding and harvesting in aquaculture, and in processing and placing on the market; they are boat-owners; they organise fishing activities and provide support to the fishermen at sea. The work of women in the fisheries sector needs to be made more visible, especially in the artisanal sector, since 85 % of women active in this sector feel they are discriminated against. This is seen as an exclusively male sector: there are obstacles to women’s advancement and the support structures available are inadequate. I am pleased that Mr Ferreira has given due attention to this opinion and that Mr Damanaki has underlined the importance of cooperation between the Committee on Fisheries and the other parliamentary committees. I would therefore like to underline some of the priority actions to be taken at EU and Member State level. What is most important is the protection of the legal and social status of women working in the sector so as to ensure equal wages, in other words safeguarding social and economic rights. Above all insurance must be provided for covering risks at sea. Much has been done, but much more can be done. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Bové’s report on promotion measures and information provision for agricultural products because it expands an important and necessary portion of the common agricultural policy (CAP). While the CAP currently has several types of promotion measures in place, it is important to expand these measures to encourage economic growth in the agri-food sector. The European agri-food sector has the ability to prosper and assist economic stabilisation in the Member States, and developing more extensive promotion measures both for the internal European market and for external market shares. For these reasons, it is important that local, regional, and external promotion measures are adopted, with the focus placed on short food-supply chains and local farming systems. Barbara Matera  (PPE

 Children are increasingly more exposed to digital media through television programming and internet access, raising concerns about internet safety and harmful online content.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted first and foremost to thank the rapporteur for having taken on board all – or most – of the points in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am Vice-Chair. Economic crises compromise efforts made towards gender equality: the employment rate among women falls ever lower and the gender pay gap grows ever wider. The contractual safeguards for many women and mothers are still precarious and the number of women in leadership positions and in the political, science and technology sectors is low. Adequate funding for EU programmes is necessary to reduce the gender pay gap and encourage access for women to highly skilled jobs. An increase in the labour market participation of women would free an important amount of talent that has remained untapped for many years. In the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, we proposed uniform formats for women’s integration, and above all specific measures targeting vulnerable groups of women.

The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 come at a difficult economic and financial time, when the Member States are being forced to introduce harsh fiscal consolidation measures. However, the EU budget can only be seen as offering huge added value with regard to investments made at national level. The Commission’s proposal freezes ceilings at their 2013 levels and significantly weakens the requests made by the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 to strengthen European policies to enhance competitiveness, small and medium-sized enterprises and sustainable infrastructure. Parliament hopes for a ‘responsible’ reaction from the Council.

The European Year of Citizens is intended to increase the active civic and democratic participation of Union citizens. As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I support this proposal because I hope that it will not only reinforce equality and solidarity among the Member States, but will also enhance gender equality among citizens and increase the participation of women in the economic, political and social life of the European Union.

First and foremost, the provisions will establish uniformity throughout the EU for victims’ rights and protection, ensuring all victims of crime will be treated in the same way regardless of the Member State in which they are located. Notably, the report encourages the individual assessment of a victim’s needs, particularly those with specific needs, when determining the methodology of protection. It recognises the unique nature of gender-based discrimination and urges particular protection for those who are repeat victims of crime. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 as a support system for workers impacted by global structural change in trade patterns. Denmark’s application in respect of the Odense Steel Shipyard notes that the country’s workforce is highly concentrated in manufacturing and metallurgy, but has lost business because many global market shares have been transferred to Asia. By mobilising the EGF with an amount of EUR 6 455 104, workers will be helped to return to the labour market, which is especially important because these employees have highly specialised training in their field which it is nearly impossible to apply in other industries. For these reasons, I voted in favour of Mr Bendtsen’s report. Barbara Matera  (PPE

– Spain’s application for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the construction sector in the NUTS II region of Aragón addresses redundancies caused by the current economic crisis. The financial and economic crisis has greatly impacted Spain’s construction industry due to a lack of demand for new construction. This trend is in line with the falling demand for new construction that exists throughout Europe, but the condition of the housing market has degraded at an even more rapid pace in Spain. A mobilisation of the EGF for an amount of EUR 1 300 000 will allow workers that had been employed in construction to diversify their skills, which will alleviate some of the burden of unemployment in Aragón.

 I voted in favour of Mr Gustafsson’s report on the role of women in the green economy, as developing the green economy involves creating new jobs, in particular, for prevalently male sectors where the participation of women is still limited. By analysing data and statistics regarding different employment areas in the European Union, I noted with regret that a high concentration of ‘green’ jobs are normally filled by men. In most cases, women involved in the transition linked to new job opportunities are underpaid compared with men. The disparities in access to different green trades and professions are a threat to the equality of the transition towards a greener labour market. To facilitate women’s access to new ‘green’ jobs, I would argue it is vital for the Commission and Member States to organise specialist training courses in areas such as renewable energy, thereby giving women real opportunities to join the labour market in remote areas where unemployment affects young people in particular. I am referring, for example, to the potential for women to succeed in the area of solar and wind power in southern Europe. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Consular protection for citizens abroad (in accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 46 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) operates both for day-to-day matters and for emergency situations. Emergency situations are arising in an increasing number of contexts and for this reason the simplification of access to rights and better knowledge of these among citizens is desirable, so that they are in a better position to benefit from solidarity between Member States if their own country is not directly represented in the third country or if they are having difficulties reaching their own embassy.

The implementation of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research programme, which is the technological pillar of the SES project, is a vital aspect for its success, especially from 2015 on, when the program should be launched. Unfortunately, there are still several gaps in the single airspace project, particularly with regard to the realisation of Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB).

All actions aimed at upholding safety in the sector must be regarded as essential, in particular the strengthening of provisions on issuance of certificates of competence, medical fitness and fitness for duty, and the proposals on better working conditions and control of alcohol abuse. It is essential to aim for greater involvement of the Commission through greater transparency, and for easier access to information in order to a provide fuller picture of the employment situation in this sector.

 I welcome the report by Ms García Pérez. I believe that simpler and faster registration procedures will encourage farmers to register their quality products and ingredients and to communicate their added value more effectively to customers, who will thus be in a position to make more informed choices. The role of foodstuff producer groups – by which I mean all producers, processors or producer-processors – is important, and they will be able to take steps to protect their own trade names and to promote the authenticity and reputation of their goods. This vote coincides with the start of discussions over the reform of the common agricultural policy 2014-2020, where we will also talk about managing supply, which the regulation adopted here does not address.

 I welcome the resolution on the proposals regarding a European banking union. The fact that we are voting on this resolution the day after the Commission tabled two proposals to enhance banking supervision shows that Parliament – the only democratically elected EU institution – is keen to make a major contribution to putting together the instruments that will give the Union and the single currency greater stability, without negative repercussions for Member States that are not part of the euro area. In my view, it is essential that we achieve a fully functioning European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as soon as possible, which, although it certainly further limits Member State sovereignty over public finances, at least has the benefit of excluding the contributions they pay from the calculation of their sovereign debts.

 The resolution on the alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners in European countries by the CIA focuses on an issue that continues to cause controversy, including in Italy. Collating flight data managed by Eurocontrol suggests that there is an illegal system that has led to suspicious disappearances, which is unacceptable. All responsibilities need to be established so that there is no recurrence of similar cases in the future. The fight against terrorism in the EU should be conducted in compliance with EU law and the sovereignty of the Member States, which have the right and the duty to prosecute those suspected of terrorism and bring them to trial.

 I am dissatisfied by today’s vote on beef labelling. Although it was only by a few votes, we were unable to keep voluntary labelling. A specific request from the entire Italian supply chain, which rightly expressed concern, given that abolition involves a financial loss for farmers – many have already invested in and successfully use this tool – as well as a competitive disadvantage compared with other markets, as Italian production is characterised by its quality. The fact that the rapporteur has decided to refer the text back to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) bodes well, considering that in Council, a majority block may form to reintroduce compulsory labelling systems to defend the principles of quality and traceability.

 I welcome the vote on Mr Dorfmann’s report, which aims to safeguard an important sector and one which is an area of excellence for Italy and for Europe. Parliament is granting more flexibility to Member States so that the sector can also take definitive decisions before the entry into force of the common agricultural policy (CAP) 2014-2020 reform, which we are working hard on at the moment. With today’s vote, we are pursuing the objective of giving greater flexibility to Member States so that they can decide on the national financial envelope of the wine sector, all of which is linked to the proposal for direct payments under the new CAP.

 The huge delays in adapting the package of basic regulations on the common agricultural policy (CAP) to the Treaty of Lisbon are down to the Council’s intransigence and the deferral of the Polish Presidency, which prevented us from finalising the agreements that had earlier been made. Today, we once again find ourselves faced not just with the old regulations in the package, but also with new texts on the CAP and with voting on alignment to the Treaty of Lisbon, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in April 2011. The changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon – abolishing the old comitology system, allowing the Commission to exercise implementation and enforcement powers that amend the role of the Council, which, acting on a proposal by the Commission, can adopt measures to set prices, levies, aid and quantitative limitations – show us the important role of Parliament even more. Accordingly, we need to align the body of laws to the new framework, bringing in an alternative system that is in keeping with Articles 290 and 291 and allows Parliament to act to protect farmers, land, products and agricultural markets.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached with the Council has resulted in some significant improvements. I am thinking of the establishment of strong, independent national regulators to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to the market, which is one of the key points of the recast; the minimum five-year term for contracts between Member States and infrastructure managers, which will allow for better long-term investment planning; and the major focus on safety, both in terms of rolling stock maintenance, an important distinction being made between light and heavy maintenance, and in terms of the technological modernisation of infrastructure and trains to improve safety (particularly through the European Rail Traffic Management System). In short, the net outcome is positive overall, although one crucial point for the completion of the single rail market remains unresolved, which is the opening up of national rail passenger traffic. I hope the Commission will keep up the momentum it developed a few months ago and will put forward a new proposal in that respect by the end of the year. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text we have adopted today provides a good basis for starting negotiations with the Council. I am certain that this innovative instrument will lead to improvements in road safety, drivers’ working conditions and competition in the sector. I am particularly pleased regarding the amendment that I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) on joint liability. I believe it should be possible to hold any operator in the transport sector liable for infringements of the regulation in question, and not just road haulage companies and their drivers. The text also calls for smart tachographs to be fitted to all vehicles, old and new, by 2020. This requirement will certainly entail a major effort by companies in the sector, but it is equally important to remain ambitious and gradually install digital tachographs even in those vehicles that use analogue ones. A final critical point is, I believe, the definition of ‘daily working period’. In my view, it is not consistent with other definitions given in existing legislation, particularly with regard to a driver’s rest periods or breaks, which would remain part of the working period according to this definition.

 Parliament’s adoption of the report recommending deployment of the eCall system is a clear signal of its support for the topic of road safety. Every year in Europe, there are more than 40 000 fatalities on the roads. By means of the eCall system, it is anticipated that this number could be reduced by more than 2 500, with a reduction of 10-15% in the number of injured, thanks to an increase of 40-50% in the speed and efficiency of response centres. Furthermore, it is important to remember that eCall will have minimal economic repercussions on final costs, which amount to about EUR 100 per vehicle – a perfectly reasonable price given the great benefits it will bring. It is now essential that the Member States and the respective mobile phone networks commit themselves to improving their infrastructure so as to guarantee this service to the maximum extent possible. As of now, 5 500 drivers have use of such a service in 10 countries: the positive effects achievable from 2015 with its introduction in all 27 Member States would be of vital importance.

 It is currently difficult for the consumer as well as supervisory bodies to distinguish between normal food products and those designed for specific groups. The reasons for this ambiguity could be differences in the interpretation and application of rules by Member States. That is why I voted in favour of Ms Ries’s report: we need a legislative reorganisation, with uniform laws that guarantee innovation, competitiveness of businesses and protection of information for citizens. The European Union must commit to achieving uniform treatment in the area of food so as to provide greater legal, economic and social certainty, covering not just the goods consumed and produced within the European Union but also those which are exported and imported. In this sense the regulatory provisions on gluten and lactose are of paramount importance as they are aimed at protecting an ever-growing section of the population. Figures show that food-related conditions are becoming more and more common, causing an increase in depression, stress and general poor health: let us help make these people’s complicated lives easier.

 In the Treaty on European Union, the Member States pledged to safeguard the principles of democracy and respect for human rights. Clearly all candidate countries must have satisfied these conditions before negotiations begin, but this does not imply indifference to conditions outside the EU. The last few years have been extremely dramatic for Tibet and the people of this nation have given a strong and succinct message: after 50 years of Chinese occupation, Tibetans are calling on the world for real change – a change that includes dialogue with the Chinese leadership, not an intensification of violence. The strategic partnership between the European Union and the People’s Republic of China should be based on common principles and values: the latter’s great economic dependence on exports ‘Made in China’ and the importance China attaches to its international reputation can influence such a change, if we make the effort. To guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, freedom of speech and association and the release of political prisoners, we need to take concrete action. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Gender-based violence and all forms of harassment and exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be wiped out. Full and equal participation of women in civil, social, cultural, economic and political life, and elimination of any kind of discrimination are the prime objectives of the international community. Protection of women’s rights has received a significant boost thanks to international instruments and commitments from the United Nations and the European Union. I think we are all in agreement that female genital mutilation is a serious form of abuse and torture of children and, I must specify, children from the age of just four. Today too many women are still subjected to these practices, which cause psychological trauma, indescribable physical suffering and repercussions on their health and which cannot be justified by tradition or as a symbol of identity. Ladies and gentlemen, we must all say a loud ‘no’ to female genital mutilation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of this resolution. I must say that I am very sad to see the negative repercussions of this social depression, if we can call it that, and I am firmly convinced that we must act promptly to avoid a worsening of the global economy. The Treaty requires economic matters to be seen as an issue of common interest, with policies inspired by the need for healthy finances that cannot compromise the functioning of the economic and monetary union. The Stability Pact itself highlights the need to create incentives for prudent budgets, obviously avoiding excessive public deficits and strengthening surveillance. This surveillance allows us to identify risks as well as possible and take responsibility promptly. As the Commission has said, the EU must take shared responsibility, which I think also involves risk sharing. That is the only way we will be able to ensure coordinated and well monitored budgets.

 I voted in favour of this regulation. The main reason for doing so was that, for the first time, we saw a legislative text that really lays the groundwork for new and essential mechanisms for securing sovereign debts and building towards growth. Here, contrary to the view of my group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) – I had no hesitation in voting in favour of eurobonds and the redemption fund. I voted in favour of the amendment on the golden rule, which would exclude investments from deficit calculations, and I regret that it was not carried. The way things are now, it is time to take urgent action: no more blind austerity; we have seen that it cannot work by itself. We need to mutualise debt while calling for austerity and, above all, we need to support growth before it is too late. The EU must take shared responsibility which, I think, also involves risk sharing. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of the reports by Francesca Balzani. Following flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied for assistance to the European Union; the disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF). I would remind you that the Solidarity Fund should be mobilised mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on the living conditions, environment or economy of one or more regions of a Member State. The conditions in the affected areas worsened, as always happens in these situations, because of the tragedy of the lives lost, the large number of wounded people, the families who lost everything and the very serious damage to homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructures. In these regions, the use of the EUR 18 million released by the fund will therefore help our fellow citizens to regain the peace of mind that they have sadly lost. Finally, let me congratulate the volunteers of the Italian Civil Protection Agency who, in those weeks, as well as currently in Emilia and Lombardy and as always in the past, have shown professionalism and humanity.

 I voted in favour of the reports by Mr Fernandes. Following the flooding in Liguria and Tuscany, Italy applied to the European Union for assistance. The disaster, being of natural origin, falls within the scope of the Solidarity Fund. I would point out that this fund should intervene mainly in cases of major natural disasters with serious repercussions on living conditions, the environment or the economy in one or more regions of a Member State. Conditions in the affected areas were made worse, as always happens in these cases, owing to the tragic loss of human life, the high number of injured people, the families who lost everything and severe damage to residential homes, businesses, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. Therefore, deploying in these regions the EUR 18 million granted from the fund will help our fellow citizens regain the peace of mind which, unfortunately, they have lost. Lastly, allow me to praise the Italian Civil Protection volunteers who, during those weeks, demonstrated professionalism and humanity, just as they have done in recent days in Emilia-Romagna and in Lombardy, and always have done in the past.

 I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report on cross-border voluntary activities in the EU. Following the visibility acquired through the European Year of Volunteering, it is appropriate to focus on specific measures to further promote volunteering. The ‘European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps’ will train people engaged principally in cross-border volunteering. Its creation will make an invaluable and much-needed contribution to society, demonstrating the need to build a Europe based on respect for fundamental rights and the creation of solidarity and welfare, not just within national borders and not just in economic terms. In a constantly changing society such as that in Europe, enhancing solidarity is an asset. It enables us to address and overcome human, social, intergenerational and environmental needs and concerns. Today, the EU has 100 million volunteers who are helping to make Europe and the world a better place, and I am certain that this number is set to rise substantially. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 The conditions under which former Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has, for months, been imprisoned and suffered various forms of physical and psychological violence are unacceptable. First of all, we must urge the Ukrainian authorities to ensure full adherence to the fundamental rights of their prisoners, guaranteeing fair treatment, adequate medical assistance in an appropriate facility, unrestricted visits by relatives and sufficient access to their lawyers. This situation affects the relationship between the EU and Ukraine; I therefore consider that the authorities in Kiev should not ignore what we are saying in this Parliament, which is yet another position statement following on from numerous interventions from the highest officials of the European institutions and Member States.

I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the fight against homophobia in Europe, as I believe that we should not confuse homophobia, which is of course unacceptable, with family law. As the interpretation of the European Court of Justice confirms, there is not, and there should not be, a single family model, but rather we acknowledge the diversity of national legal schemes, thus excluding the possibility of predominance by EU sources. The European Union, in fact, is a community made up of 27 Member States, 27 different cultures, and 27 different traditions, and we have to protect unity in diversity, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The European Union’s task is to foster the harmonisation, rather than the uniformity, of family law. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

As we all know, the global financial crisis, which started in 2008, has had terrible consequences and repercussions, affecting the real economy almost immediately. The discrepancy between consumer demand and supply has had devastating effects on employment too, thus giving rise to serious problems on the labour market. Europe needs greater convergence, solidarity and responsibility to combat the crisis. Among the various measures to be taken is the reinforcement of the single market’s stability through the introduction of innovative strategies, designed to achieve growth that is not just economic, but also social. I think that fiscal consolidation through the introduction of a common system of taxation for financial transactions could have positive effects on the single market, and for that reason, I voted for Ms Podimata’s report. There could be several positive effects. However, I would argue that precisely because of the now highly globalised nature of the financial sector and its services, a further shift should be made, by promoting the introduction of a worldwide financial transaction tax: firstly, the full 27 Member States and then the G20 should demonstrate cohesion in seeking this objective.

 I am voting in favour of Rita Borsellino’s report to strengthen the European Union’s internal security strategy. Over the last 30 years, a succession of serious events, such as natural disasters and terrorist and mafia atrocities, has profoundly shaken public opinion, thus hindering economic development, undermining the political integrity of the countries affected, and eroding trust between citizens and institutions. To regain this trust, a broader synergy must be created between social and institutional agents to consolidate the area of freedom, security and justice in terms of respect for fundamental rights. It is no longer useful to examine social phenomena in a local context; we now need to look beyond national boundaries. We must ensure security by maintaining existing strategies and finding innovate ways to supplement them: to be credible, we must earn the trust of the European peoples and address their needs more effectively.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are essential transport nodes and factors that contribute to growth and territorial cohesion. Frequently, however, they only survive thanks to massive injections of public money. Nowadays, this is increasingly scarce, and therefore it is important that they should have a specific vocation in order to avoid a proliferation that would lead to non-utilisation or under-utilisation of the airport infrastructure. A typical example of this is the scores of airports in northern Italy located just 20-30 kilometres from one another. At the moment, there is no precise definition for a regional airport, and the Commission should therefore set common criteria for a proper definition. Finally, I am concerned about the formulation regarding the scope of application and, in particular, the exclusion of airports whose principal catchment area is a capital city. I do not think it is correct as a catchment area is not uniform and can change. Despite these critical points, I voted in favour in order to draw the Commission’s attention to these important airports. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the approval of this resolution is a very important political signal in the fight against maritime piracy. Paragraph 30 of the resolution I proposed specifies that in the event of disputes between countries following military action aiming to combat piracy attacks in international waters, the national jurisdiction of the flag state shall be applied on the ships concerned as well as on the military staff employed aboard, as provided by international law. This aspect is crucial for avoiding future controversies like the one currently ongoing between Italy and India, and to defend the prerogatives of military personnel deployed in Operation Atalanta and as Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) on merchant vessels. I dedicate the approval of this text to Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, the two Italian sailors unjustly detained for almost three months in prison in India waiting for India to decide to acknowledge Italian jurisdiction and to allow these two soldiers to be judged by the Italian courts. I hope that European diplomacy will renew its support for Italy in this battle of civilisation. Carlo Fidanza  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Moreira’s report on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. In order to promote the development of world trade, the 27 Member States drew up a common trade policy with third countries in an attempt to abolish trade restrictions and excessive tariffs. This trade liberalisation does not imply the non-respect of rights and obligations by commercial partners operating on an international level. I believe it is crucial to apply real reforms and to be seriously committed to tackling problems relating to market distortions in order to ensure consistency between corporate conduct and the rules applying to free international competition.

 I welcome Ms Niebler’s proposal on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union. Now, with the major increase in mobility within the Union and the concurrent major developments in the telecoms sector, we cannot ask our citizens to take on the burden of excessively high costs, especially for data roaming. I therefore support the further lowering of roaming charges – tariffs that ensure complete transparency and consumer protection. I believe that these new measures, in force from 1 July 2012 and running at full speed from 1 July 2014, giving customers the chance to choose a different roaming services provider from their national operator, will encourage a greater number of operators to compete, further reducing tariffs.

 I voted in favour of the report because it points out the need for enhanced legal certainty, more interpretative clarity and uniform application of the regulations across the EU regarding the rights of air passengers, including those with reduced mobility. Greater and more effective cooperation among the different actors must be secured so as to ensure that passenger rights are protected and to clarify their various responsibilities. It is also important to clarify and strengthen existing rights and to ensure that consumers are made aware of them. Knowledge of rights is essential in ensuring that passengers can access them. That is why information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey, starting from when the passenger is considering whether to purchase a ticket. To help ensure that rights are upheld, there should be contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues that arise when flight disruptions occur.

In this sense, Serbia is in a position to become an important player in guaranteeing security and stability in the region.

As well as the profound cultural differences and the fact that Turkey does not totally belong to the European continent, I am also not convinced by its progress made towards what is considered a European model, from which it is still very far in many different ways, including its under-developed democracy, its still insufficient safeguarding of human and civil rights, the still unresolved issue of Cyprus and the military, cultural and economic repression of the Kurdish minority.

 I voted in favour of the proposal because it aims to bring 26 trade policy regulations into line with the new primary-law provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. For example, the legislature will be able to delegate non-essential legislative acts to the executive, while retaining the power to revoke the delegation at any time. The affected measures are mostly designed to allow the use of trade safeguard regulations, apart from the regulation on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. The Commission is proposing changes only where the Council decisions specifically provided for have previously applied. As a result of these specific decision-making procedures, European trade policy has hitherto, essentially, been explicitly excluded from the comitology procedures.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I must note with regret the absence of Baroness Ashton from this debate. It would have been important for all of us to hear directly from her the latest updates on the situation involving the two Italian marines unjustly imprisoned in India after being arrested following the military operation against piracy in which they were involved. I am sorry not to be able to hear Baroness Ashton speak, and I hope that Mr Piebalgs’s response will provide more precise details about the progress made in the last few days. This is not just an Italian issue, it is very much a European issue, because – you see – the exclusive jurisdiction of the country flying the flag is a universally recognised principle of international law, and the Indian authorities having brought it into doubt risks undermining the very heart of the battle against piracy by the international community and the European Union itself, which, as we have said, is involved in the Atalanta mission. Therefore, I appeal to the EU institutions to make all possible diplomatic efforts to repatriate our soldiers, ensure international law is upheld and make sure that they are the subject of a fair and transparent investigation in their country of origin. In addition, Madam President, I would like to comment on the many speeches I have heard from my fellow Members from the radical left. Frankly, I am convinced that Europe must be committed on a political and diplomatic level to help Somalia and all struggling countries to develop, but this cannot be a sufficient response to the hundreds of hostages and families waiting for their loved ones to come home, who are tired of talk and want practical solutions in the matter of international security.

This is a situation to be avoided, especially during this period of growing euroscepticism.

 Digital citizenship is a fundamental part of the European Union, and necessary for producing well-informed players in the electronic processes of democracy. The first issue we need to address is that of the digital divide and in particular the protection of the least-protected groups, including minors. The adoption of the report on protecting children in the digital world lays the foundations for a more organic framework directive that includes all the measures concerning children in previous EU legislation. It is undoubtedly necessary to encourage action to combat online crime, which has been successfully adopted by some Member States. But the cultural and legal differences among Member States make it hard to establish clearly which content should be penalised. Self-regulation adopted so far has proven useful, but has demonstrated limits that must be corrected with a unified framework of rights that tackles conduct that could have serious consequences for young Europeans. Thanks to this report, we are on the way to greater uniformity of intervention. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate before this one was on the 20th anniversary of the single market. We had that debate because the single market is one of the European Union’s main goals. If the single market were to fail, the entire European Union could fail. The same is true of Erasmus: for many young people – and not only for them – it represents the image of the European Union. Without Erasmus, many people’s perception of European unity would disappear. This is more the case than with the single market because with the single market there is also, but not only, an economic advantage for businesses and for our countries. There is nothing wrong with this, but Erasmus is different, it is about students wanting to break out of their confines and discover the cultures of other countries, share the experience of studying with people who speak a different language and perhaps have different customs and traditions, and discover, renew and strengthen our common identity and our unity. This is how Europe came into being, not through treaties or dreadful bureaucracy, but through genuine lived experiences. Perhaps without Erasmus, the single market would also mean something different, the spirit of it would be different and so weakening Erasmus could weaken our Union. The title of this debate is absolutely right: Erasmus is in danger, and the danger is that, without Erasmus, a different concept of Europe would develop. I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work and to tell the Council to make a real effort to find and authorise the funds, since the hole that exists is down to the Member States. The Europe of the future will depend on those who want to study and have experiences abroad now. Let us try not to let them down and let us be brave enough to show what Europe is really made of.

Madam President, the Year of European Citizens is a way of focusing attention on the half a billion people living in the EU. It is a way of remembering that all of the other measures we are discussing in these days – the banking union, the economic and financial measures for combating the crisis – have the interests of citizens as their primary objective. The aim of the European Year on which we have voted is to enhance the rights attached to Union citizenship and the role played by the associations in the Union, reinforcing the right of students, teachers, artists and those working creatively to move freely. In short, it aims to strengthen European identity through concrete initiatives in which the citizens play the leading role. This is a real bottom-up approach to building the Union, and the reason why I voted in favour. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this rather wonderful report by Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, which we in the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) helped to improve. The reasons for such praise lie, above all, in the acknowledgement of copyright as the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creation, investment and production. Dissemination of works, following their digitisation, is the main way to protect and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage. The European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, but much of it lies unused in the archives and libraries of our Member States, totally inaccessible to citizens. It is therefore right to make these works as accessible as possible to all. Indeed, the EU’s true wealth is its cultural heritage, which is unequalled around the world but is often neglected and loses not only its cultural value, but its economic value as well. The compromise reached between protecting copyright and allowing public access is the best way to reverse this trend and breathe fresh life into our cultural heritage, without violating any rights. It is true that perhaps not all the goals have been met, yet the glass is surely half-full rather than half-empty. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Schengen is an asset to Europe. Breaking down barriers between Member States was the first sign of something new that was starting to take shape: no more barriers but unity; no more controls but solidarity between states, which are no longer divided but united in a single great Union. That is why it is odd to hold this debate today. We seem to have taken a step backwards and it appears that we are abandoning the foundations of our fine Union. If Schengen fails, the European Union fails, but if Schengen is so important it should be protected, as precious things are. It should be protected from a Council that thinks it can bypass Parliament’s prerogatives, but it should also be protected from anything that can call Schengen itself into question. External border control should therefore be strengthened with all the legislative and technological instruments we have because, if our borders are at risk of becoming porous, this automatically makes our Member States less flexible, and they could call for stricter control, even within our borders, to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants. We cannot allow that and for that I thank Commissioner Malmström for all her work and her future collaboration on this issue. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on macro-regional strategies, especially with regard to the Mediterranean. Macro-regions have given a good account of themselves, which is why, at an historic time such as this, the Mediterranean, too, needs to be given a major development boost. The Mediterranean can become a place where culture, education, training, tourism, trade, environmental protection, transport and fishing can all come together to make this area take off, in conjunction with the ensuing Arab Spring. Tourism brings wealth, as does trade; education brings democracy and job creation; while culture, with its artists, shows us how we are all united and gives us a view of what we could become. All these factors make the Mediterranean important, particularly for all the other areas of Europe and the Middle East in general. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we decided to table this oral question because the issue is particularly important. We have always strived to bring citizens closer to the EU institutions. We do so in many ways, through the visitors to Parliament, through our local actions, using all the means of communication that our timescales allow us. We do this with constant echoes in all our resolutions; we do so, too, with the Commission’s public consultations. The Commission often uses these consultations to form the basis of their communications to Parliament and other EU institutions. In other words, the Commission bases its work on the responses it gets. Where, then, is the problem? The problem is that often, the results of these consultations are objectively embarrassing. A few dozen answers, sometimes even just single figures, representing the half a billion citizens that make up the European Union. Truly embarrassing. In 2011, the Commission had already committed to reviewing its consultation policy but to date, that is, mid-2012, we have neither seen nor heard anything. It is not a matter of lengthening timescales: we could even do it for 365 days, but the results would be the same. One of the most obvious problems is the use of languages. We very seldom go beyond the use of English, and hardly ever use any other languages apart from English, French and German. My mother could never take part in the consultations because she does not know any of the three languages in question and many of our citizens are in a similar position to her. It is not just a matter of ignorance, it is also a matter of the values we believe in and on which we have based our Union. Multilingualism, Commissioner, is one of them. Of course it is important to be competent in languages, but we have 23 of them, and why should a Portuguese, an Italian or a Lithuanian not find out about the Commission’s consultation in their own language? Of course, the lack of answers does not only depend on language but we have to start somewhere. Language is not only a great place to start but, Commissioner, also becomes a priority because, if we were to continue in this way, we might just as well make savings at the root by abolishing this instrument since we are making such a terrible impression. I want to conclude with a question to you, Commissioner: if you were in charge of a communication company, would the results of this communication satisfy you and your company? Marco Scurria,  
rapporteur.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this resolution is very important because, until just a few months ago, volunteering was an object of mystery for the European Union. Even though it involved 100 million volunteers responsible for 5% of GDP, the sector did not actually appear to exist. Then, despite a series of difficulties, we managed to dedicate last year, 2011, to volunteering and we all began to pick up on its excellent potential. Member States that did not have legislation on this issue have adopted legislation, others have updated theirs, many have increased the activities carried out by voluntary associations and, especially at a time of crisis like the one we are experiencing, have assigned an important role – a subsidiary role, as it is referred to – to the non-profit world. We started off from this point to accentuate the role of volunteering in the European Union, as shown by the report we are debating this evening. We started off with an excellent communication from the Commission, whom I thank for their work, as I thank the shadow rapporteurs and officials of the groups and Parliament who helped me draw up the report. What have we set out? First, a portal to tell citizens about the volunteering opportunities in various Member States and how to get involved. Next, use of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Manual on the Measurement of Volunteer Work and the United Nations Handbook on Non-Profit Institutions with a view to making available comparable statistics and data providing a clear picture of the significant contribution made by volunteering and of the needs of volunteers throughout the European Union. We want to give volunteering a high profile in sport, particularly at the grassroots level. We would like to recognise the important contribution also made by volunteering to protecting the environment, and to support volunteering activities in environmental education, crisis prevention and management, as well as in defending artistic and cultural heritage. We support the Commission’s proposal to establish a European Skills Passport, so that the skills acquired through volunteering may be officially recognised, both for professional and for learning purposes. A passport that should be a comprehensive document listing all practical experience, training and soft and vocational skills acquired through lifelong learning, including those gained through volunteering, if desired by the volunteer. We urge the Commission to put this European Skills Passport in place as soon as possible. We also support the Commission’s proposal to create a European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps, which will increase the participation of volunteers in solidarity actions in the context of the humanitarian aid policy throughout the EU. We wish to ensure adequate and stable funding and establish and simplify administrative procedures, including tax incentives, for the organisations involved in volunteering work, including associations and networks, particularly for small associations with limited resources, with a view to enhancing their roles, activities and achievements as they provide such benefits to society. As Henry de Montherlant used to say, ‘Selfless acts are the stars of the earth’. Volunteering work has this capability. With its activity, provided free of charge, it can bring the stars onto our earth and plant them firmly into the soil. Our flag, Mr President, is made up of stars, which is why the EU must not fail to strengthen the voluntary sector and its world made up of great little everyday gestures. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I think it is a positive first step towards bringing order to EU-China relations, which are clearly imbalanced. The EU is founded on certain fundamental values. For example, we rightly ask our businesses to respect the environment; we give importance to workers’ rights, first and foremost, women’s rights; we do not make children work; and we do not have concentration camps with free labour. In China, however, all this protection and these rights do not exist. Far from it! There are still barriers to European goods accessing the Chinese market, and goods are clearly produced there at a lower cost, resulting in unfair competition with European companies and goods. We must establish true reciprocity in relations with countries outside the EU so that, where there are causes for imbalance, they are offset by financial and trade provisions that safeguard our businesses and our goods. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think there could be a better day on which to hold this debate. Today is Europe Day, when we celebrate the idea of uniting 27 countries to date, creating a single market, a common currency for many of our Member States, ongoing cultural and educational exchange; an exchange, in short, of feelings of greater togetherness and closeness. What medium unites us more these days than that of communication? A single internal telecommunications market cannot, in fact, be said to exist without telecommunications and if significant differences remain between domestic and roaming prices. Therefore, the ultimate aim we have set ourselves is also the hypothetical one of being able to eliminate the difference between domestic charges and roaming charges, thus establishing an internal market for mobile communications services. It is one of the aims that we must set ourselves. In this way, competition will improve, and people will be protected. It is an economic saving, because high roaming charges always constitute an impediment to the Union’s efforts to develop into a knowledge-based economy and to the realisation of an internal market of 500 million consumers. That is not all. The creation of a European social, educational, cultural and entrepreneurial area, based on the mobility of individuals and digital data, should facilitate communication between people in order to attain our aim, which is to build a real ‘Europe for Citizens’. For these reasons, I thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, for her skill and her great capabilities at mediation, but most of all, for having attained the aims that have been achieved, given the importance of this issue. Obviously, I also thank all the shadow rapporteurs. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are here because – as we have also heard here in this House – we are also celebrating our Europe, an institution created to bring together what are now 27 countries, to create a single market, to give some of these countries a single currency, and to bring together countries with the same vision and the same plans for the future, for culture, education, and much more. One of the key words of this Union is solidarity. Today, the basis for this debate is what has happened in Sicily, what has happened in Lampedusa, including in recent months. However, this situation is clearly not restricted to Sicily or Lampedusa alone; it is something that concerns Malta, and has concerned and still concerns Spain. Consequently, if this solidarity does unite 27 countries and wants to unite 27 countries, it must be seen and it must be felt. It is a solidarity that sometimes has not been felt by these countries, which sometimes have felt alone and abandoned when it comes to quite serious problems taking place on their coasts. Today, however, we need to develop these aspects, we need to develop the tools that allow us to monitor our coastlines, and we also need to establish bilateral agreements with the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, agreements that will allow us to avoid migration flows of vast proportions. We have seen that this system is the one that works the best, that also gives people the chance to retain their dignity, not to have to flee the countries where they were born, and also not to deprive the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean of such human and professional riches. Accordingly, if we are to celebrate this Europe, let us celebrate it also by remembering the reasons that make us united, that bring us together, and also that allow us to have a better dialogue with the countries of the Mediterranean.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Italians, we are obviously particularly sensitive to this issue. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and the Commission for its words, especially its references to the clause and issue of defamation. This is an important report, because the rapporteur has managed to find the right balance between personal freedom, privacy and legal certainty. Often, too often, we see examples of defamation, sometimes truly unwarranted, thanks also to the freedom of information offered by new technologies – the Internet in particular – with what are effectively invasions of people’s privacy. Therefore, I think that the idea of setting up and creating a centre for resolving or acting as a point of reference in disputes is truly a choice that represents both freedom and the rigour that we were all expecting. I also look forward to hearing what the Commission has to tell us about this in the future, also because today, perhaps too many things have been left unresolved. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 The economic crisis – and its consequences in terms of the imposition of austerity measures and budget cutbacks – demographic changes, rapid technological change and the resulting demand for new skills pose serious challenges to, and call for far-reaching reforms in, Europe’s higher education systems, which must not have a detrimental effect on the quality of education. In a knowledge-based society, the future hinges on education, research and innovation. This report marks a step towards implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, which states that, by 2020, at least 40% of 30-34 year-olds in Europe should complete higher education or equivalent studies, given the estimate that 35% of all jobs in the EU will require such qualifications.

 I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress achieved by Turkey, especially in underlining the critical issues that are still unresolved. As mentioned in paragraph 11, it is of primary importance that Turkey should have a modern and efficient, fully independent and impartial judicial system, guaranteeing due process of law for all citizens. The growing number of new applications to the European Court of Human Rights shows that the objective has not yet been reached. For the purposes of modernisation, the issue raised in paragraph 29 also seems fundamental. The government must (is called upon to) take all the necessary measures to increase the social inclusion of women and their competitiveness in the labour market, especially through policies aiming to diminish the gender gap specifically in secondary education. It is even more important to mention here that Turkey’s military occupation of the northern part of the island of Cyprus without any legitimate claim has been in place ever since 1974.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this seems like a film from the past. We had thought that by now, piracy was something that only related to the Internet and issues concerning copyright and similar issues, instead of which, piracy is precisely what we know about from books and films of adventure. Obviously, the modern incarnation involves boarding a ship with machine guns and rocket launchers, not scimitars, and quite honestly, my left-wing friends, it has nothing to do with class war. It is irresponsible to claim that pirates exist because of capitalist exploitation. There are no justifications for attacking, stealing and killing – and to say so means to be complicit in such crimes. It is a tragic problem, and it is even more tragic when the people protecting the ships in accordance with international law are arrested by the authorities of other countries duplicitously in clear violation of international law, as was the case recently with the two Italian soldiers in India, or rather in international waters, who were then taken to harbour in India. I would like to thank the Commissioner for the comments made this evening in the Chamber, also because I hope that protecting the law is truly one of the EU’s main priorities. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Berlinguer’s report on the Bologna process. The creation of an open European Higher Education Area has been a major achievement for all of us. Even more important is the need to harmonise the recognition of degrees and the qualification framework, as well as the complete revision of the national systems of quality assurance in university teaching. We still have students today who gain degrees through Erasmus that are subsequently not recognised by their own universities or only allow enrolment in universities that are too different and sometimes even of questionable standing. This is why we need to reinforce the process, in order to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of increased employment and economic recovery, based also on improved cooperation between universities and the world of business and work.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I do not understand why we take so much pleasure in harming ourselves. You have spoken about Morocco as an important partner on a human level, while many of us have already mentioned that Morocco is an imperialist state that occupies land illegally, in which the United Nations has not succeeded in holding a referendum. You have spoken about democratic links with Morocco. Well, in Morocco 22% of the population has the vote, it is one of the countries with the greatest illiteracy levels, farmers and fishermen do not have the right to form trade-unions there and everything is in the hands of the King. You have spoken about convenience for farmers. It is a pity that no European farmers have noticed this convenience, as you are well aware. Explain to me why we are asking our farmers and fishermen to comply with rules that do not apply to those who fish and farm outside of Europe but who are allowed to export their products into Europe. Commissioner, please tell me why democracy is valid for all but sometimes does not seem to apply at home. Marco Scurria,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to renew my best wishes and my compliments to the President for his new position. I wanted to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fisas Ayxela, for doing an excellent job: it is a really comprehensive report which sends out an important signal in the field of sport. The rapporteur has worked well, including with all the shadow rapporteurs, and of course I thank them too for the result. Finally, I also wish to send my greetings to Commissioner Vassiliou. Moreover, it really is a good sign that we are holding this debate and have completed this report in the year when the Olympics will be taking place, the crowning moment for sport worldwide, a time when sport turns into a vehicle for the global exchange of values and friendship. For this reason, we have stressed that sport is a tool for combating discrimination, bearing in mind how difficult it still is, for example, for women to play sports in some countries, such as Iran, which therefore worries us not only because of its decisions on nuclear power. Another significant factor is the idea of supporting the designation of a European capital of sport under the leadership of ACES, the European Capitals of Sport Association. As we have learnt from the European Capitals of Culture, the promotion of activities for the young and old is at its height under such initiatives. The report also includes the fight against doping, a focus on gambling and the rediscovery of traditional games. I think, in short, that we have done a good job in terms of honouring as far as possible the EU’s new competence in sport under the Treaty of Lisbon. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Today I thought that we had changed the order of business, and from the tone and arguments I thought we had decided to talk about President Assad’s Syria rather than a European Member State. I have heard talk about citizens who are afraid to live in Hungary, about a ‘black plague’ knocking on the doors of the EU, about a constitution that is a knife to the throat of minorities, and more. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about Venezuela here. I have seen Mr Orbán, a prime minister, who has come to explain his version to us, and says he will comply with whatever the EU decides. We have to believe him because he has already done so with the law on the mass media. So why all this fuss? Perhaps not because we are really that interested in the institutional and constitutional aspects of the affair, but because we do not share Mr Orbán’s political choices regarding the family, the state and opposing strong powers, and the influence of the banks on political decisions. We must be very careful. We do not have the right to interfere with the internal affairs of the Hungarian people. All we can do is check compliance with the Treaties, and I think this is what Mr Orbán is here to do. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, Baroness Ashton stated that repression must come to an end in Syria and the phase of transition should begin. However, we are all wondering how this could actually come about: it is true that sanctions have become harsher, although we need to step them up further to make them more effective, but at the same time, the regime does not even listen to the Arab League any more. Therefore what is and what might become our future role? I think that Baroness Ashton’s efforts should, above all, focus on putting huge pressure on the UN, China and Russia, because if President Assad feels he has support in China and Russia, he will not feel isolated. The role these two nations are playing in the United Nations is truly objectionable, as is the funding that the European Union bestowed upon Syria – or rather on President Assad – until a few months ago. Was he not a dictator before now? Has he only just started depriving his country of freedom and democracy? We therefore need to step away from this concept of political correctness, in which anyone who does business with us is automatically considered worthy of financial concessions and a relationship with the European Union.

 In order to tackle youth unemployment in the EU, we need to implement a series of measures such as extending compulsory education to the age of 18 and creating ‘second chance’ schools. These schools would have teachers, psychologists and trainers to allow young people in situations of difficulty, poverty and early failure, also brought about by an excessively rigid existing education system, to be reintegrated into the education system with flexible learning programmes sensitive to their interests and extra-curricular pastimes. In the face of youth unemployment affecting one in five young people, reducing early school leaving by 1% would suffice to produce 500 000 qualified young workers. Furthermore, according to recent statistics, 52% of young people who leave school without qualifications remain unemployed. In order to guarantee Europe, which is in the grip of the economic crisis and rising migration, the concrete possibility of a return to growth and social cohesion, I believe it is crucial to focus on knowledge and suitable levels of education. The reform of the education system must involve partnerships between schools and local enterprises in order to offer students a better careers service. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first and foremost, to thank Ms Paliadeli for the patient work she has carried out in producing the second reading of this provision in collaboration with the other rapporteurs, including my colleague, Ms Sanchez-Schmid. Contrary to what was has been said of late, I am very convinced by this provision – because we can have different ideas and between us we can think things that are clearly different, but if we are here, we are here because we believe in the European Union and we believe in certain values that the Union has established and has seen emerge. These values are the fruits of a common history created by so many individual components in our own nations, in our own cities and in our own lands, but which have then shaped a common civilisation, history, identity and tradition. There is no need to rewrite history to say that Gdańsk was the gateway to the liberty and democracy of a large part of Europe. There is no need to call out the English soldiers who fought in the Second World War, because they were not fighting solely for England’s sake but to bring back liberty and democracy to the whole of Europe. There is no need to recount that this label comes at a price, as with anything of importance. In reality, this is a price which is comparatively small compared to so much of what we support, because by means of this provision, our territory will have factories, houses, libraries, historical centres, castles and places of worship that will remind us, in the diversity of our lands of origin and our nations, that we are children of the same culture, that we are children of the same land which we call Europe, and that, perhaps, if we always return to look at these places, we will find the answers to so many of the problems that trouble our Union today.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is never appropriate to rank crimes in order: they are all, clearly, despicable. However, the crimes we are talking about this evening are especially contemptible. Perhaps it is not by chance that one of the harshest pages of the Gospel is the one where Jesus says: ‘Whoso shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.’ Rarely are the words of Christ more damning. Some days, you go home pleased at having done a good job: today is one of those days. Thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Angelilli, and to the other European institutions, the Commission and the Council, we are launching an important piece of legislation that includes: measures against sex tourism; a clear definition of the crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation, and of child pornography, as well as the aggravating circumstances; a guarantee of as much free psychological help for victims as each case requires; a decision on the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of these crimes; a focus on prevention; and much else besides. Even these days, when anti-politics seems to have the upper hand, politics is able to provide a clear and tangible response, in the first instance for the benefit of the many associations and volunteers who deal with these issues on a daily basis and for the police forces that carry out a highly sensitive and extremely valuable job which, in some countries including my own – Italy – has reached standards of genuine excellence and constitute examples to be followed. Today the important thing was to produce a European strategy to make our citizens feel that the Union is there for them, especially on such crucial issues as these. We can be quite secure and proud in saying that we have succeeded in doing so. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the minute I have to speak, I would certainly like to thank Ms Gardini for the excellent report she has drafted, not least because it comes out of discussions with the competent institutions and the associations working in this area. However, we need more than that. We need a legislative resolution that can go a step further and organise civil protection across Europe with no more gaps and no more overlaps. At a time when the role of the European Union is being debated, this is an area in which there is a demand for more Europe in order to develop united, coordinated action by the whole EU, particularly because civil protection depends on solidarity and volunteering. That fits in nicely with the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon and the current European Year of Volunteering. A financial instrument is needed as well, of course, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing this out and requesting an increased budget. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 The amendment to the Frontex Regulation was a necessity given ever increasing illegal immigration within the borders of the European Union. In this light, setting up teams of European border guards particularly helps a number of Member States to manage huge and sudden migratory flows, such as those that took place following the Arab revolts. At the same time, the procedures for the most vulnerable categories – above all, unaccompanied minors – represent the other side of this measure, where respect for the law and solidarity intersect to guarantee both human rights and the security of the Member States.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Syrian poet, Adonis, has written an open letter to President Assad in which he addresses the President and says that no one believes that democracy can be instituted in Syria immediately after the fall of the current regime; rather, it is unbelievable and unrealistic for Syria to continue the systematic violence to re-establish order. He adds that that is the problem and that it is necessary to lay the foundations of democracy from the outset, now, and not tomorrow. He then says that, on the other hand, without democracy, there will only be a retreat to the abyss. The ‘abyss’ the poet is talking about is growing larger every day in Syria: people filming are being shot, children of even 11 years of age are being imprisoned, some army officials are starting to become discontented and starting to desert. Many would follow them if they could more easily cross the borders with neighbouring states. Even today, the Corriere della Sera
, in analysing the situation in Syria, states that in Syria, the protest is not abating, Assad is not stepping down and the world does not see. Baroness Ashton, Europe is the only institution that can show the world what is actually happening; it is the only institution that can make a real gesture, that can help, but, above all, provide a prospect for the future. It is time to invest in the Mediterranean, thus choosing to envisage a world of peace and stability for the future. It is time for courage and for the European flag, as Adonis told us, to fly in Benghazi as a sign for the whole Mediterranean region. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to vote for this report because it sets out some fundamental elements for cohesion policy and for funding. These are, firstly, leaner procedures for national funds, and, secondly, the provision that sport and culture are also an element of cohesion that is both important and decisive. Perhaps the only negative element of this report is that it envisages only the three working languages of English, French and German as the languages that need to accompany the request in addition to the original language. For this reason, in any case, and for more general reasons I voted in favour and I congratulate the rapporteur. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, to be honest, I did not want to participate in the discussion on the G8, but I did want to put a question to President Barroso regarding culture. In the European Union, there are many programmes to encourage youngsters – and others – to meet, so that this becomes a real Union. For many youngsters and professionals, programmes such as Comenius, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action, etc. have represented the true coming-together of the European Union, inspiring truly European sentiments. (The President interrupted the speaker to explain that the debate was on another subject, but then invited him to continue …)
 I would like to know, therefore, what is to become of these programmes, at least as far as the Commission can tell, seeing that they are approaching their expiry dates and we should already have confronted the matter within the Committee on Culture and Education. How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on? I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries. Marco Scurria,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), all the rapporteurs who presented reports this morning, as I believe that these reports allow us to lay the foundations for the Europe of the future. This morning, we are working on future generations, from children to our young people, whom we must guide into the world of work by means of the important flagship initiative entitled Youth on the Move. This morning, we are discussing expanding the Union towards the Balkans through culture, as well as developing cultural and creative industries. At a time of great economic crisis, it is important to emphasise that the only sector not making a loss – in fact, its turnover is actually increasing – is the cultural sector. We would like culture to play a part in the external actions of the European Union, and not only, Lord Dartmouth and Mr Kuhn, through well paid officials, but rather by constructing a better process for peace, stability and understanding between different cultures. Today, though, we must also seek to strengthen our programmes for culture, education and young people. For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action,
 and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union’s existence. For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon. We need to invest in all these programmes but, above all, we need to believe in them. Nobody is denying the importance of milk quotas, investment in industry and protecting the environment; but it is culture that will allow us to build Europe, and we will have to do this not with words, but with programmes and actions that we are able and willing to put into practice. Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations. This is how Europe will be built, and at times it may even be necessary to bend those regulations a little. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Baroness Ashton for the report she has put before us today. However, I should like to point out to her that public opinion in Europe is unfortunately not aware of the European Union’s presence. As many of my fellow Members have also mentioned, our external policy is still in a rudimentary state, as can be seen from certain events that have happened in recent days. Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf: it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection. It is our duty to intervene in that part of the world, just as it is in Syria. This country is in a really very serious situation, in which human rights and the chance to oppose a dictatorial government must get the European Union interested … (The President cut off the speaker) Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Speaking a few days ago at a meeting of industrialists, Italy’s Minister for Finance, Mr Tremonti, coined a new phrase – the ‘nuclear debt’. The Member States that have invested in nuclear power are the ones with the highest levels of public debt. How much does it cost to close first- and second-generation power stations? How much do the stress tests, which we are discussing at such length today, cost? Once a power station is shown to be ‘stressed’, how much does it cost to ‘destress’ it? Furthermore, how much does it cost to dispose of radioactive waste? No one has yet told us. As the European Union, we could begin to think of different options to show the Member States. Moreover, given that the Commission will have to provide us with a road map, why not begin to think of real investment in fourth-generation nuclear power – clean nuclear, or fusion – or even begin to consider an overall energy plan? We expect the Commission Communication to outline a road map on this subject and to try to give the European Union a clear direction at last in this sector. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this point of the debate, practically everything has been said, and perhaps that is exactly the point. We continue to talk and, as we speak, the landings are continuing and people are dying at sea and crowding in inhumane conditions on the Italian and Maltese shores, which are not the shores of Italy and Malta, but the border of Europe, gateway to our European Union, through which any of our 27 Member States can be reached. The time for talk is over, we are told by our citizens and the migrants who sought freedom and found themselves locked in closed camps. It is time to act, Commissioner. I call on you; we call on you to take the lead as early as tomorrow, after our vote, and to send a request to the Council for the implementation of Directive 2001/55/EC and jointly establish a true strategy for the future of the Mediterranean, because at stake is not only Europe’s credibility but also its immediate fate. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure and pride that we are discussing this strategy here this evening: pleasure because Mrs Járóka has done an excellent job, for which I thank her, and pride because it is an initiative that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have very much wanted. It is an excellent report because, of course, it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the Roma, and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach. We like it because it not only sets out rights but also highlights certain needs. We also dealt with it in the opinion that we gave as the Committee on Culture and Education. I am thinking, in particular, about the whole part relating to schooling for Roma children, in which we point out that schooling is both a right and a duty, in which the children’s families must also be involved. I would also point out that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion. Alongside the promotion of Roma culture, it is also important to recognise that the Roma should make an effort to learn about the customs and culture of the peoples with whom they live, so as to facilitate real integration. Perhaps the only thing missing in this report is a reference to Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens. In this regard, we have been waiting for a long time for the Commission to give us an interpretation of how to put it into practice, and we now need to know what it is right and fair to expect the Member States to do. For everything else, I again thank the rapporteur for all that she has succeeded in doing. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking part in the discussion a little shamefacedly, because the Commissioner has more or less told us that it is pointless to conduct this debate because there is nothing to argue about. We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions – in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber – we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission’s views – and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union. Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps – no, definitely – because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place. Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow. More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus. Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens. I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for her work. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, this crisis should give us the impetus to find out whether the European Union really wants a foreign policy role. Foreign policy is a serious matter: it needs strategies, firm objectives and clear alliances. We cannot continue travelling around the world patting everyone on the back and pretending that everything is going well all the time. Elections took place in Egypt a few weeks ago and we did not get up in arms because we realised that there was a dictatorship that was fooling all of us. Now that millions of people have taken to the streets, we are all talking about democracy and human rights. This is what we want, and we will try to make sure it happens, but we should be careful about following the crowd. I remember when the Iranian people rose up to get rid of the Shah, and we know how that ended, with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now. I hope, for example, that the Egyptian Government will be able to keep extremists at bay and play a stabilising role in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Baroness Ashton, more democracy is certainly needed in that part of the world, but so is more European policy. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT)
 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are tackling yet another debate on the violation of human rights and democracy in Iran. This time, it is the case of a lawyer who protects human rights activists in Iran. Indeed, the idea is to solve the problem at source by no longer merely imprisoning people who fight for their rights, but to go directly to those that defend them, just to show which way the wind is blowing for those who wish to oppose the Ahmadinejad regime. I would place a bet today, Mr President, that in a few weeks’ time, we will be back in this Chamber to speak about another different case of all basic rights being violated in Iran. The violation will be disguised by some criminal motive that would be laughable were it not so tragic, such as acting against national security or propaganda against the regime, as in the case we are discussing today. I really do wonder, Mr President, whether Parliament should continue to have a delegation for relations with a regime that is the exact opposite of everything the European Union is founded on. Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, we are tackling a debate that is partly the fruit of the work of many associations across the continent and the European Union that turned to us precisely in order to deal with this delicate topic, which was initiated by Mrs Angelilli, and which we have turned into this oral question. From a dialectical point of view, they have presented us with a very simple problem, or so it would seem. There are many children in institutions across Europe and there are many families that want to adopt children. However, these two paths do not often seem to cross and the children remain in care and the families remain childless. Clearly, these children are our priority. They have our attention and they need us to take all the precautions that the situation requires. However, when these children remain in care for too long, they are often targeted by traders in prostitution and organ trafficking for these new slave traders. All this is happening whilst, meanwhile, many families would like to open their homes to these children. I am therefore very happy to have heard the Commissioner outline the measures that she intends to adopt. However, we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions, as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children, obviously. We therefore ask for more streamlined procedures for the families and the children, because in a few years’ time, these former children and young people will have become men and women and will ask themselves why a Europe full of potential host families left them in their condition. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Vassiliou and thank her for her strong backing for this initiative, just as I should like to thank Mrs Paliadeli and all the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done. Europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulties at present. Indeed, we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty. Obviously, that is an important thing to do, but Europe must not lose sight of the importance of the values that have allowed the Union to emerge victorious from the innumerable challenges it has had to deal with during its history. Europe’s wealth lies in its history, its culture, its art, its leading figures, its landscapes, its symbolic places, its intellectuals, its philosophers and – dare I say it – in its civilisation. This label can represent all of this and highlight all the myriad forms of European identity that the Member States have contributed over time. We must now look at the negotiations with the Council to resolve a few differences of interpretation on several points. I believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily, given the importance of this topic. I also believe that as soon as this report is definitively adopted, we shall all feel more European, due to the values and traditions we share. I believe that through the Commission, the work carried out by Parliament and with the Council, we really are doing a good job for all our citizens. (The speaker agreed to take a blue card question from Mr Martin under Rule 149(8)) Marco Scurria  (PPE
). 
 – (IT) 
Mr President, I am very happy to respond to Mr Martin because we know that the bureaucracy issue is sometimes what distinguishes and separates European citizens from their institutions. Seen from this point of view, I think the path set out by this report is quite clear. We shall also talk about it with the Council. Once the Member States have decided which sites the European label could be given to and once we have a panel of true experts coming together, who are given the chance to select the sites within a necessary but not excessive amount of time – and we still need to work out who will have the last word on this, but it is an issue that we shall have to discuss both with the Council and Commission – I do not see excessive bureaucratic issues from this point of view. There are bureaucratic issues for many other measures but not on this one regarding the label, which I think can easily be followed in a secure timeframe and with clear results for all European citizens. Marco Scurria,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other than the Commission, I should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier. What we are talking about today is important because it is an instrument like ‘Youth in Action’ that creates the spread of ideas, closeness and friendship amongst the countries of the European Union, but also, and above all, amongst those that are not part of it, such as Switzerland or other countries besides. It is the great richness of our multiannual programmes that, through actions such as ‘Youth in Action’, ‘Erasmus’, ‘Erasmus Mundus’, ‘Permanent Education’, ‘Media’, ‘Media Mundus’ and many others, they allow relationships to be built between the countries of the European Union and third countries. Through these programmes, you see, we have brought the European Union to life, allowing many citizens – primarily young people – to meet, swap experiences, come to know others and to become known themselves. We have given teachers and workers in general the chance to improve their professional skills and we have given directors, producers and associations of various countries the chance to do better work. Hence, these programmes are important and so we were a bit concerned when we did not see them on the Commission’s Work Programme for next year. Today, therefore, today we are approving an important step, which makes the EU grow, strengthens citizenship on our continent, and – given that we spoke about it a little while earlier regarding the European Heritage Label – it is a step that contributes to creating this European identity of ours. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, amongst friends one can speak frankly and tell things as they are. Hence, we are telling Morocco that it must do much more to resolve the Western Sahara situation. The European Union cannot continue, and could not continue, to pretend that it is all nothing, because we risk committing a serious error. We risk telling those who have chosen peace, like the Sahrawi people did through the Polisario Front, that they have chosen wrongly. Those who do not send suicide bombers, who do not carry out attacks, and who trust only in international organisations do not make the news. For these people the powers of the world do not come together. Madam President, that is not right, because the Sahrawi are a courageous but mild-mannered people, they live their religion in the right way and their women have important roles in society. The Sahrawi are fighting for their land, for which their love is as infinite as their desert; and they are fighting for their identity, and it is not right that they are left to themselves. The vote we have striven for tomorrow in this part-session is an important sign that the European Union is working to take a decisive role in the destiny of this area of land. Marco Scurria  (PPE

I hope that the actions identified in the Action Plan will be carried forward within the planned timeframe considering their importance for improving the lives of European citizens. In particular, Italy has always supported the need to develop mutual trust between Member States of the Union and is in favour of continuing to extend EU regulations in the sector of justice and internal affairs. From this perspective, we strongly support the approach of the whole Action Plan, which hinges on the principle of mutual recognition of decisions, to be achieved by strengthening mutual trust. I would also emphasise the need to use all possible means to foster a European judicial culture, particularly through legal teaching and training. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 I take this opportunity to emphasise that a humane society is necessarily based on the principle of justice between the generations, and that age discrimination jeopardises solidarity between the generations, leads to poverty and is forbidden by the founding treaties. Work is more than just paid employment and both young and older people contribute substantially, including through their work in the family, to making our society more humane and improving the stability of services and workplaces. In this report, we call on governments to facilitate and recognise voluntary work that provides care in the community and family care, and to resolve issues of legal responsibility in that regard without delay. I also applaud this report for calling on the Member States to adopt measures to recognise invisible and informal work carried out by family members, predominantly women, of all ages in caring for older and younger members, in the context of solidarity between generations. Marco Scurria  (PPE
),

 Italy is the country where enterprises suffer most due to late payment by public authorities, with an average period for payment to suppliers of 180 days as opposed to the European average of 67 days. This leads to financial problems, a drastic reduction in investment opportunities and a loss of competitiveness, particularly for SMEs. The directive we have voted for today discourages debtors from paying late and allows creditors to protect their interests effectively against such lateness, introducing the right to legal interest caused by late payment even when not specified in the contract. It also forces public authorities to pay within a maximum of 60 days from the payment request, provided the service has been performed satisfactorily. The adoption of this directive is truly a great help for our enterprises: nowadays, one company in four closes down as a result of problems of insufficient financial liquidity. These new rules on payments will mean that companies will regain their market competitiveness and no jobs will be lost. Marco Scurria  (PPE
).

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly appreciated the Commissioner’s approach to this discussion, because she stated that there are essentially no real infringements in Europe and also because she reassured us about the Commission’s role as guardian of the treaties and therefore also of press freedom and freedom of expression in Europe. Certain dangers nevertheless still remain. The Commissioner noted that almost half of the countries belonging to the European Union are subject to infringement proceedings to find out whether press freedom and freedom of expression are really guaranteed there. She also highlighted the preventive measures that must be implemented in these areas, emphasising however, that the problem is not specific to one State or to individual States. It is obviously not an Italian problem – Parliament expressed itself on this subject a few months ago by taking a democratic vote – and neither is it a political party problem, because we have just heard that in Germany, it is the socialist group that controls certain media outlets. The problem we must face in this Chamber is more general. Tomorrow, we will vote on a report on journalism and new media – creating a public sphere in Europe. This report contains certain guidelines on which our Parliament is beginning to express its opinion. We must talk about how to combine truth and freedom in the new media, but also in the more traditional media, because while it is one’s right to tell all, it is also one’s duty to tell the truth when writing or expressing oneself through a media outlet. We must also understand how to combine information with the right of citizens – of all citizens – to privacy. These are the issues we must tackle and to which Parliament must confine itself, not ideologies or certain matters concerning things that do not exist in any European country. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in place of our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who – as announced by President Buzek at the beginning of the session – has tendered his resignation from the European Parliament in order to take up duties in his own country, and to whom I send my regards and my best wishes, because he has done a great job. This report is the result of his intentions, and it was carried in our Committee on Culture and Education by an overwhelming majority, with just a single vote against, for which I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this report, both on my behalf and on behalf of Mr Schmitt. Before leaving for Strasbourg, on Monday I went to Rome to visit a private training centre that is achieving superb results, because it has succeeded in placing the vast majority of young people that it trains over the course of time. When I spoke to the director of this centre, he said to me: ‘Please help us, you in Europe too, to follow this course, to add weight to training that moves in this direction, which enables so many young people to find work; help us also to modernise the relationship between universities and business.’ The thrust of this report lies precisely here: today, 20% of young Europeans are out of work, of whom about 30% are graduates; a percentage that is so high that we are forced to ask ourselves very seriously about how we should approach the issue of training young people for entry into the world of work in these times, in this Europe, in this globalised world. We have then, in this report, wished to address directly the issue of how to improve the link between universities and business, highlighting certain key points: first, by giving priority to one of the strong points available to the European Union, namely the ability of its citizens to adapt to the constantly changing circumstances of the labour market; the fact that there is no longer any such thing as a ‘job for life’, and that these days, training and retraining is essential. The first point then is lifelong learning; the second, which, in our view, is of fundamental importance, is that of mobility. These days it is important, as we highlight in this report, to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds, and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and Erasmus for Apprentices, but also the organisation of postgraduate European Masters of Excellence programmes, in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses. Furthermore, more entrepreneurial universities should be encouraged. Such a result can be achieved, for example, through the introduction of a system of knowledge vouchers such as that currently in use in a number of Member States, enabling SMEs, in particular, to improve their research capacity without compromising the independence, autonomy and public character of universities. The third key point is that of research, namely, we see greater researcher mobility – in both the short and long term, across nations and between academia and business – as imperative in enhancing knowledge transfer. Finally, the possibility of extending the good practices in this area that exist in so many countries. I shall conclude, Madam President, by illustrating, in relation to this report and the outstanding work done by the committee, how convinced we are that Europe will not win the battle against China or other developing nations by means of low wages, but by having highly qualified professionals and highly competitive businesses, and in this process, it is of maximum importance that universities and businesses realise how they are interdependent, and that the authorities at all levels contribute to developing more efficient methods of cooperation. Marco Scurria,  
deputising for the rapporteur.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish again to thank the Commission for its communication, which we have adopted for the most part. I should just like to dwell on a perhaps critical aspect that has emerged in this debate, because someone emphasised how fundamental the independence of universities, freedom of research and public financing are. We are all agreed on this, and that is why I fail to understand these critical remarks, because it is enough to read the report, where, in the very first paragraphs, we have written very clearly and stress that the intellectual and financial independence of higher education institutions vis-à-vis business must be maintained and no relations of dependency on business must arise on the part of higher education. It also emphasises that universities should, in all circumstances, maintain the autonomy to decide over their curricula and governance structures. This dispels any problems or doubts whatsoever in this area, which is why I do not understand what these problems could be, unless it is a question of old-fashioned ideological exploitation. Let us accordingly really give some thought to this, since this report sets out the conditions for effectively improving the lot of our young people and our students, because there is truly no one who wants to leave hundreds of thousands of youngsters in the hands of who knows what business purposes but, on the contrary, only wants hundreds of thousands of students to have the opportunity of studying, training and working in the society that awaits them. Marco Scurria  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to contribute to this debate because we are preparing to vote for what I believe to be an extremely important measure: it is important to rationalise the work of our enterprises, but especially to protect consumers. Those who buy must know what they are buying, and those who seek quality must find quality! However, it is also important to have an idea of the social sustainability of what we are buying. Someone has already said this – but I want to stress it again because I think that this is a specific point that must emerge from this discussion in the European Parliament – I want to know whether a given product is made in a place where workers are protected; I want to know whether that product involves the exploitation of children; I want to know whether that product is the result of unfair competition. So here we have a measure that I hope will soon be extended to other manufacturing and craft sectors, because I believe and conclude that this measure will bring Europe much closer to its citizens, and for this I thank the rapporteurs who have brought this measure into being, and the Commission and Commissioner Tajani for being a driving force behind it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something because, as was mentioned previously, the Italian Embassy and other embassies were attacked yesterday in Tehran. Because of this, Parliament and the Union should also consider expressing their solidarity, formally if possible, with our country and all the countries involved in this attack. We should also send out clear signals, though, and I therefore officially request that Europe should not be present at the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution in Iran and that this should be a clear signal sent by us to the Iranian authorities. I am also saying this on a special day for Italians, because today is the Day of Remembrance. This is the reason I, like many Italians – including you I hope, Mr President – wear this tricolour rosette in memory of the many Italians who were cast out on this day and forced to leave their own lands. Through this act of remembrance, I would like to express our solidarity for those who are struggling for democracy and freedom in Iran. For this reason, I call on our authorities not to go to the celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Republic. Marco Scurria  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in European Union publications and on EU websites, we often say that human rights are the heart of the process of European integration and the key element of its external relations. The countries that have entered into political or trade agreements with the European Union are bound to respect these rights. Baroness Ashton, we ought to ask ourselves whether these requirements still exist in our relations with Iran and whether it really makes sense for us to send a delegation to Tehran without agreeing a programme with the Iranian Government which both sides endorse, one which will allow us to listen to the arguments and voices of the opposition, too. With regard to what we can do, we must, however, be careful even about talking of sanctions, because history shows that economic and trade sanctions have often strengthened regimes instead of weakening them, and that they have, in fact, weakened the people and, above all, the poorest of them. When we listened to certain people as a delegation, and heard testimony regarding the rights of women and minorities in Iran, they told us that perhaps it would be better to impose symbolic sanctions, such as cultural sanctions. In recent days, many representatives and intellectuals throughout Europe have been writing to call for UNESCO not to hold World Philosophy Day in Tehran. I think that this could be a commitment taken on by this Parliament too, remembering that Neda Agha-Soltan was a student with a degree in philosophy, and that this symbol could unite the European Parliament as it calls upon UNESCO to take this action.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to thank Parliament, all the committees, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. We have prepared a report which raises the profile of the voluntary sector. There are 100 million people throughout Europe who work in this field, and each day they selflessly give their time for the good of others and our community. This is the work we have done, increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU-wide activities for the benefit of the associations. I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič and the Swedish Presidency for the excellent work we have accomplished together. I think that this year will mark the beginning of Parliament showing a true interest in this area, which someone called the backbone of our society. Once again, I would like to thank all those who have worked on this important report. Potito Salatto  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not join my Italian colleagues in asking the EU to intervene to protect the two Italian soldiers because I believe that this should instead be the duty of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as it concerns two European citizens of Italian origin. Unless, in this Chamber and our institutions, we do not make the cultural shift that will require the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to take care of our citizens, especially when international rules have been flouted – the most basic of which is that a ship in international waters is subject to the jurisdiction of the flag it is flying – we will never manage to give Parliament a significant role at international level. This would cause serious damage and continue to leave foreign policy to be implemented by individual Member States, rather than creating the supranational state of Europe that citizens are crying out for. I was amazed when Baroness Ashton initially replied to calls for explanations from Italian fellow Members by saying that, ‘We did not receive any requests from the Italian Government’. Moreover, this evening, you, Commissioner, also introduced the issue saying ‘We are acting at the request of the Italians’. This is the wrong cultural and political approach. We are a great nation, a great continent, and we have to take care of our European citizens regardless of their nationality wherever they are, taking action to safeguard them in accordance with international law. I hope that sooner or later, Baroness Ashton will be capable of making this cultural shift. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out quickly to this House that the Bureau gave the green light for the European delegation for relations with Iran to travel to Tehran, subject to a few conditions.

I would ask you to revise this stance. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of what has just been said, I and my Italian colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in the Delegation for relations with Iran are absolutely opposed to this trip to Iran and ask the Bureau, which had decided to give the go-ahead, to re-think this action, which simply gives free publicity to the government in Tehran.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, aside from this issue, I should like to submit a problem to the Presidency. I think some people have not yet fully understood the role of the European Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon. I feel I must point out an underlying problem here: the Commissioner for Transport, Mr Kallas, has repeatedly refused to meet with the board of the Sky and Space Intergroup to discuss the Cost-Effective Small Aircraft (CESAR) project, which affects everyone in terms of the economy, the environment and security. I would urge the Presidency to call Commissioner Kallas to this Chamber to explain the programme he intends to move ahead with in this sector, which is extremely sensitive and important for the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to carry on listing the reasons for our disagreement with the Iranian Government. Since it has not been referred to here, I will only emphasise one of the most serious violations of civil rights, which relates to young people. The Iranian Government, having signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, nonetheless continues to impose capital punishment on minors. After this debate, I would like, firstly, Baroness Ashton, to take on the task of setting out a common approach for Europe as a whole and the European Parliament as a whole on events in Iran and, secondly, the inter-parliamentary delegation for relations with Iran to note that it must change its line. I, together with my friends Mr Scurria and Mr Tatarella, protested to the delegation: in an official statement, it stated that it wanted to visit Iran in any case, even though it had made a peremptory request to have the opportunity to meet and talk to the opposition. From now on, I would like the delegation to start singing from a new hymn sheet and to sustain relations of assistance, support and debate with the exiled representatives of the opposition, not least Mrs Myriam Rajavi, who typifies this situation. This is what the European Union should be doing, rather than imposing sanctions. Potito Salatto  (PPE

Mr President, I have held up my card three times now, and you have not given me the floor, whereas you have given it to Mr Schulz. I shall therefore now address my question to the speaker and to all those who have taken the floor, irrespective of their political group: have they enquired as to whether the centre-left governments have ever issued a law that could prevent the concentration of the mass media in the hands of Prime Minister Berlusconi?

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Ms Jazłowiecka’s report, which lets us take an important step forward in the current debate on the economic recovery of individual Member States. While balancing the Member States’ budgets is a priority on the one hand, targeted social investment is also needed to prepare individuals, families and businesses for the change of economic climate and the demands of the employment market. As well as the sustainability of public finances, the Member States should also be focusing on how to create sustainable, quality jobs, on how to invest in training and updating of skills, and on fighting poverty and social exclusion. Hence the need for, and perhaps urgency of, a coordinated approach to social investment and therefore a Social Investment Pact for the whole of Europe. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of Mr Becker’s report, which provides a better framework for the contribution of social businesses to solving the current crisis. Social enterprises are unfortunately often seen as a sort of appendage to traditional forms of business, based exclusively on the maximisation of profit. Social enterprises, on the other hand, have a fundamental role to play in the development of markets and the European economy. They enable innovative responses to be made to economic, social and environmental challenges, through sustainable development, social inclusion and territorial cohesion. I therefore support the proposal to set up a Social Entrepreneurship Fund, which meets the primary objective of not exposing these businesses to unregulated competition, guaranteeing them adequate financial support and facilitating their market integration.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, at a time when, for some nostalgic nationalists, speaking of closer European integration sounds provocative, we are about to vote on amendments to a regulation which forms the basis for the difficult but necessary process of harmonising and bringing closer together the national legal systems. Allow me therefore to congratulate Mr Zwiefka on the excellent work carried out and his success – after around two years of difficult negotiations – in bringing to a close the process of revising a regulation which has been of fundamental importance to citizens of the Union. Brussels I in fact establishes provisions which are of the utmost importance in ensuring sufficient access to justice and equality of treatment before all the courts which have competence in the European Union. It sets up common standards in civil and commercial matters, clarifying which Court has competence in a cross-border dispute, and making the sentences issued enforceable in the different States. The amendments made to the regulation are required in order to put into practice the wish to create a European area for justice which promotes judicial certainty and predictability of decisions, thus making transnational trade easier and strengthening the single market. That said, I believe that progress towards an ever deeper harmonisation of the standards of substantive law must proceed with the appropriate caution and attention in order to ensure certainty of law and to protect less favoured parties. For this reason, I agree with the approach taken by the rapporteur in favour of consumers, who will benefit from the principle of protection for the weaker party. A basic principle under which, in a legal dispute between consumers and businesses, the consumer will always be able to choose a court in the Member State of his or her residence. Similarly, I share the prudent approach taken by Mr Zwiefka regarding the abolition of the exequatur
: while on the one hand abolishing the exequatur
 would allow recognition of sentences to be speeded up at a later stage, on the other I believe that measures for safeguarding defendants’ rights must be maintained. It is therefore necessary for defendants to have the possibility of contesting a decision if their right to a fair trial has been breached and if the decision goes against ordre public
 in the reference State. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my compliments to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. I hope we shall reach broad interinstitutional and political consensus on a regulation which forms the template not only for cooperation in the civil courts but also for political determination based on the process of European integration.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very satisfied with the report by Ms Bastos, on which I voted in favour. Unfortunately, the severe economic crisis in Europe has had a negative impact on perceptions of the single market’s potential, among both citizens and businesses, and some governments and national political movements. There is a danger that this will cloud our vision of the excellent work done by the European institutions to revitalise and strengthen the single market, for example the wide-ranging public procurement reform and the revision of the Late Payments Directive. I agree that there is a need, as Ms Bastos has stressed, to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation between the European Union and the Member States. Fundamental measures – such as the setting up of unitary patent protection – are all too often blocked or delayed by institutional conflict and national egotism. In a period of crisis like the current one, we need to take a united approach to governance, one which enables us to introduce the necessary legislation promptly, to revitalise the internal market and strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, almost two decades have passed since the concept of European Citizenship was legally established, but still only 43 % of EU citizens claim familiarity with the term ‘citizen of the European Union’. They lack information and awareness of their rights: language barriers and the non-recognition of diplomas, degrees and qualifications are among the most common problems that EU citizens face on a daily basis. I therefore agree with the Commission’s initiative to declare 2013 the Year of European Citizens. I also fully support the rapporteur’s wish to have the scope of application of the Decision widened to focus on enhancing the awareness of citizens in order to allow them to make full use of their rights, and not just their right to move and reside freely. I also hope that the Year of European Citizens will not be another celebratory year but rather provide the foundation for a framework for the future policies, measures and actions needed to reinforce Union citizenship. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Madam President, it is clear that if the European Union wishes to emerge from the crisis, it should enhance the competitiveness of its small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are responsible for the creation of 85 % of all new jobs in the EU. It is therefore necessary to harmonise national industrial polices to a greater degree, while it is also essential to achieve another objective: internationalisation of SMEs. Only 25 % of SMEs in the European Union have been internationally active within the single market. I therefore agree with the actions proposed by the Commission aimed at encouraging the process of internationalisation and the need expressed by the rapporteur for provision of specific information about priority markets together with details of the various support services available. In conclusion, I would underline the need for greater coordination of the various initiatives at EU level. At a time of rationalisation of public spending, we cannot afford to duplicate efforts or policies, risking the creation of pointless administrative and bureaucratic burdens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg and my fellow Members who, through their excellent work, have helped to bring to life one of the key actions of the Digital Agenda for Europe. The directive we are shortly to approve will help achieve two fundamental goals in the development of European copyright. First of all, it will enable the dissemination and enjoyment of works that otherwise would have risked disappearance from our cultural heritage. This initiative therefore fulfils one of the undisputed cardinal rules of copyright, namely, the protection and promotion of culture and intellectual creations. Secondly, this directive will make it possible to modernise and improve Member States’ legal frameworks by bringing existing legislation into line with technical developments and the need for greater flexibility. This will help boost the economic benefits of copyright by ensuring fair remuneration for work and identifying any rights holders under an absolutely solid regulatory framework. Turning to the use of orphan works for commercial purposes, I support the approach taken by this House, which allows commercial use solely in order to pay for the costs associated with the public service carried out by the various relevant institutions. Indeed, the directive does not address issues relating to profit-seeking utilisation of orphan works, but rather legitimate and cross-border access to such works, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity and depth of Europe’s cultural heritage.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we find ourselves debating the political situation of a country that since 2007 has been an EU Member State, and one that has been meeting its obligations under the acquis communautaire
. Among the legal requirements and political objectives that unite and bind together the Members of the Union, the rule of law is an indispensable prerequisite for the democratic organisation of society. That is why it is so important to debate the current situation in Romania, which is taking on worrying proportions as a result of a power struggle and an unprecedented war between its institutions. In this conflict a majority has tried to take over and dominate all the other bodies, including the Constitutional Court, the judiciary and the other institutions, and bend them to its will, while overstepping and sweeping away the balance between the powers, offices and institutions. It is strange that a certain part of this Parliament that always takes an interest in the level of democracy and freedom in the countries that make up the Union appears indifferent on this occasion or is even trying to justify the situation. I think this House and the Commission would do well to keep a very close eye on what is happening in Romania. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr Turmes’s report, which paves the way for adoption of a directive that will finally make it possible to overcome the differences between Member States with regard to energy efficiency. Though it does not change the non-binding nature of the goal of energy efficiency set by the climate and energy package of 2008, the directive imposes on suppliers and distributors compulsory annual saving schemes in terms of final consumption. According to the Commission’s figures, the measure will bring about a total saving of around EUR 20 billion in the costs of investment in energy generation and distribution. This is vitally important and will help reaffirm the Union as a global player, since the future geopolitical balance will be primarily decided by policies on the supply and use of energy resources.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, whom I thank for the excellent quality of his work and for his valuable suggestions. Despite the ongoing harmonisation of standards of protection and asylum, we still have a long way to go before creating that concept of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities enshrined in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Indeed, the Dublin system places disproportionate expectations on those Member States constituting entry points into the EU. I therefore agree with the priorities identified by the rapporteur on practical cooperation, technical assistance and financial solidarity. On this latter issue, I think it is absolutely necessary to make the best use of the complementarities between the different EU funds available, in order to translate solidarity into concrete action, including financial incentives for relocating beneficiaries of international protection.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Ms Comi for her work and for the excellent quality of her report. Standardisation is one of the twelve levers to boost the internal market and will play a key role in helping to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Indeed, the new regulation will enable European businesses to obtain certificates of conformity and safety for their products and services more quickly, using a technically updated, flexible and effective system. This will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular, enabling them to reduce production costs and administrative burdens, and raising their profiles in the single European market. That said, we will need to continue encouraging voluntary consultations between industry, public authorities and other stakeholders, so as to ensure that the development of standards and regulations is transparent and can be updated over time.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to sincerely congratulate the Danish Presidency on its excellent work and on the significant results achieved in the context of the European Semester. In particular, I offer my congratulations on its excellent negotiating skills which helped, albeit in a somewhat convoluted manner, to end the vulgar and absurd diatribe concerning the location of the European patent court. As rapporteur, I agreed, with regret, to postpone the final vote following the Council’s unilateral proposal to amend the proposal for a regulation, but I must point out that this way of operating is unacceptable. It seriously undermines the constitutional balance of the EU, especially in an area and a measure that are fundamental to boosting economic growth in the European Union in key sectors such as innovation. This is a measure in which Parliament took a programmatic, constructive approach. I would therefore like to express my deep bitterness over what happened and call on the Council of Ministers, represented by the Cypriot Presidency that has now taken over, to find a solution with regard to the substance and the procedure as soon as possible. It will not be Parliament that causes a project that we have been working towards for over 30 years to fail, nor shall this Parliament allow the rules governing interinstitutional relations to be unilaterally modified by any institution. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, company law can act as a lever for developing the internal market. In difficult times like these, we now need to work together to find acceptable solutions that can be implemented rapidly. I shall therefore be very clear, Commissioner, as to what this Parliament expects in the coming months; you have already noted certain requirements in your speech. First of all, we hope for a pragmatic and flexible approach to make the legislation clearer and more accessible. To that end, even though a single instrument would offer significant benefits, the directives could alternatively be grouped by sector: for example, by the principles of function, mobility and forms of law. The other priority is to place European company law at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given that over 90% of European businesses are SMEs, the internal market needs to be the natural environment for them to operate in, not merely a potential option. Lately, Parliament has been waiting, with some impatience, for a legislative proposal to set out the measures to facilitate companies’ cross-border mobility. That is all I shall say, because this subject is so huge that it is hard to cover it all in just over a minute. Nevertheless, I believe that there will be no shortage of opportunities for useful discussions. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Scurria’s report which, at the end of the European Year of Volunteering, concretely sets out its objectives and strategies. I fully agree with the aim of increasing the importance of volunteering and promoting cross-border regulation at EU level. Cross-border volunteering is an inexhaustible source of learning and personal growth, contributing to the development of an economically and ecologically sustainable social conscience. To this end, I consider three initiatives proposed in the report to be key: the establishment of a centralised portal on volunteering, the creation of a European Humanitarian Aid Corps and the development of a European Skills Passport. I hope, finally, that there will continue to be a strong common will to invest in an area of such importance that promotes the development of common values and helps the integration process.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully supported the report by Mr Kalfin, whom I thank for the excellent quality of the work he has done, and agreed with the report’s contents. The Internet is a critical infrastructure. Online attacks can cause serious consequences and safety risks for both businesses and private households. For this reason, I agree on the urgency, highlighted in the report, to develop a reactive, flexible framework to prevent cyber attacks. Since virtuality does not have boundaries, it will be necessary to improve international cooperation and regulations in order to make future strategies effective. In this respect, the European External Action Service (EEAS) can and must play a key role in starting a constructive dialogue with third countries, including, where possible, issues regarding Internet security in the scope of its external relations. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported the report by Ms Herczog, who correctly detects the need for a coherent approach to improve regulatory convergence with neighbouring countries. The fact that Europe is a major purchaser of energy on global markets can, in fact, be seen as a weakness. On the other hand, the fact that we are also the biggest importer could be one of our strengths, if only the EU countries were to take a common negotiating position with third countries. I therefore support the approach proposed by our colleague, in particular, with regard to the three objectives underlying the whole strategy; namely, improvement and coordination at EU level, especially in strategic sectors such as research and innovation, the need for increased diversification of energy sources and, finally, the development of sustainable common policies on a global scale.

 Mr President, I voted in favour of Ms Borsellino’s report, which addresses the need for a cross-party, multidisciplinary approach to security. I especially agree with her emphasis on establishing the key areas of the strategy, including the fight against terrorism and organised crime. I do not, however, believe it appropriate to adopt measures to protect intellectual property rights, in that this matter is already the subject of in-depth ongoing debate. That said, it will be essential to enhance EU judicial and police cooperation through Europol and Eurojust, via a proper implementation of the strategy. At the same time, proper and consistent legal instruments will need to be developed to facilitate the investigative process and the use of evidence. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, I welcome Mr de Jong’s report, which seeks to clarify the extension of the new European area of freedom, security and justice in criminal matters. The discussions under way in the Council are proceeding steadily, with two opposing positions: those who warmly welcome developments and those who are cautious about the emergence of an EU criminal law. The operational proposals that Parliament has advanced in response to the Council’s views are on the right track, namely, towards a careful examination of the need for, and the consequences of, adopting EU-wide legislation in this sector. I therefore fully support the request for additional resources to strengthen Parliament’s Legal Service to enable the proposals to be evaluated systematically and in depth. At the same time, in my view, it is essential to promote greater coordination between the institutions on this matter, in order to ensure that future initiatives are based on broad consensus and on Member States’ criminal justice policy requirements.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the priorities and the points Mr Busuttil has stressed in his report. I hope this House will adopt the report by an overwhelming majority so as to further enhance the operation of the single market, which is an absolutely vital part of the policies for EU development. That would send out a strong signal to the individual Member States. The latest results from the internal market scoreboard have shown how Member States are increasingly failing to deliver on the transposition of European legislation. That is why I agree with my fellow Member that we need to increase the power and flexibility of infringement proceedings, while rethinking the role SOLVIT should play as an alternative to seeking legal redress. In that respect, I share his reservations about the danger that we might run into problems with the principle of subsidiarity if the legal basis for SOLVIT is over-formalised. I therefore think the Commission needs to examine all kinds of solutions very carefully so as to make the portal more operational without running the risk of getting bogged down in legal technicalities. Lastly, we must bear in mind the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has redefined Parliament’s role considerably by giving it substantial powers to structure and review EU legislation. In that regard, the conclusions of the scoreboard need to be properly examined within this Parliament’s regular dialogue with the national parliaments, with a view to a more fruitful collaboration with the national authorities.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Ms Wikström on her work, the excellent quality of the report she has produced, and the compromises she has reached. The purpose of this report is to plug what is, unfortunately, a serious and glaring gap in Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 (Rome II), which emerged due to the lack of an agreement on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. This has arisen, in particular, due to the considerable impact of accessibility via the Internet to content that is published and distributed on a massive scale on blogs and social networks. It is therefore a necessary step to facilitate access to justice, ensure the internal market functions properly and deliver an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the right to privacy. I therefore fully endorse the urgency in adapting Rome II highlighted by the report, and I am particularly pleased with the proposal to create a centre for the voluntary settlement of cross-border disputes arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. Considering the high costs of judicial settlement, an alternative voluntary dispute settlement system, which would, of course, be less costly, could meet two needs. It could protect individual rights and personal image, while at the same time ensuring freedom of opinion. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated Ms Hübner’s report, which offers a useful way to stop essential resources for countries in crisis being decommitted. This is a regulation of fundamental importance which, without making any changes to the European Union’s budget, will provide an alternative to the risk of losing funds already assigned under the cohesion policy to Member States involved in a financial assistance programme that have problems with cofinancing. I especially agree with the precise definition of the instrument’s ceiling and the policy decision to favour projects that have generated revenues and those that could contribute to achieving the Member State’s strategic goals in order to improve its chances of economic recovery. I believe that this measure will contribute to balancing the need for investment in development and growth with the excessively-revered austerity solution to the sovereign debt problem.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the agreement addressing the need to strengthen transatlantic cooperation in fighting terrorism after the 11 September attacks. I do not share the intransigent position taken by the rapporteur who, despite the positive opinion of the Commission Legal Service and of the Data Protection Working Party, has continued to assert that the agreement was unnecessary and disproportionate. I am aware of the limits of this agreement and of the room for improvement; nonetheless I believe that its requirements in terms of data protection have greatly improved. The agreement obliges the US authorities to share their data analysis with the judicial authorities of the European Union, explaining in detail its permitted use, namely the fight against terrorism and transnational crime. I therefore believe that it would be unnecessary and detrimental to start new negotiations, at the risk of a rejection of the agreement which might deprive Europe of any law in this field.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this report, through which Parliament is trying to send out an important message on simplifying and harmonising corporate taxation. The existence of 27 different legislations on corporate income tax does not only mean high costs and red tape for businesses operating in different countries, but also the serious risk of tax evasion and tax discrimination. This intervention is essential to reduce the costs for businesses operating in several states and to promote economic growth and economic recovery within the internal market. Finally, the optional nature of this measure, which gives companies the possibility to assess the benefits and costs when choosing the new system, neutralises the reluctance of some Member States that fear their sovereignty in taxation and revenue may be at risk. In the interests of citizens and businesses rather than solely on the basis of calculations of national self-interest, I therefore hope that the Council will be able to reach an agreement without resorting to enhanced cooperation.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Berlinguer, whom I congratulate on the work and the excellent analysis he carried out. The report fully highlights the problems and shortcomings that are obstructing the effective development of the European Higher Education Area. In particular, I am referring to the inadequate relationship between universities and the world of work, to the still unfinished revision of the national systems of quality assurance and to unfair access to university educational systems. Therefore, I share my fellow Member’s calls for the adoption of a common system of quality assurance in order to establish mutual recognition of university qualifications. At the same time, I hope that the next ministerial conference, scheduled to take place in April, will address the sore point of the issue: the need and urgency to move quickly in the process of revising the directives on professional qualifications and their recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are almost 450 000 international successions opened each year in the European Union, for a total value, as has already been said, of over EUR 120 billion. Nonetheless, there are still numerous difficulties for citizens to face to establish which State, and which authorities shall have jurisdiction in matters of succession. To that we should add that most Member States do not allow the citizen to choose the jurisdiction applicable at the time of succession. There are also numerous questions arising regarding the judicial recognition of official notarial acts in a Member State other than the one where they were drawn up. These serious shortcomings, these tangible needs on the part of European citizens, are addressed by the regulation which we are about to adopt, and in doing so, ladies and gentlemen, we are not approving a classic piece of legislation, but rather we are creating an instrument to regulate a crucial aspect of institutional organisation within every society: indeed, the concepts of inheritance and succession as well as the rules governing its effects and individual details have huge repercussions for the organisation of any society. For that reason, I would like to sincerely thank everyone who contributed to this challenging project and in particular Mr Lechner for his work and for his efforts during the difficult legislative process that is now coming to its conclusion. I thank him first and foremost on behalf of those millions of European citizens who will benefit from a tool that fully meets their needs and makes a substantial contribution to the process of European integration.

Your reply at the time maintained that you had written to all the Member States and were waiting for the relevant confirmations. My questions are as follows: what stage have we reached?

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Masip Hidalgo on the work he has done, which recognises the key role played by the defence of intellectual property rights as an indispensable instrument for economic growth in the European Union, in that it creates jobs and protects cultural diversity. Infringements of intellectual property rights effectively do enormous damage to Union revenues and it is essential to strengthen our efforts to combat unlawful acts through collaboration between national authorities, European Union institutions and industry experts. The adoption of this measure answers this need and enables us to lay the foundation for creating a single market for intellectual property rights. Embedding the Observatory within the European Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market will in fact ensure that it has the human, financial and logistical resources it needs in order to carry out its task in an effective manner. We are at the start of a long journey, during which we shall have to monitor and evaluate the Observatory’s activities with close and careful attention. Infringement of intellectual property rights in fact occurs on many levels, requiring different degrees of protection and recognition by Member States. It will be essential to continue to make use of the expertise of national authorities and the many specific representative organisations. This will enable us to strengthen the technical skills of the Observatory, thereby simultaneously ensuring that every intellectual property right is recognised at the EU level without any hierarchical ordering of the level of protection and recognition.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Lechner on the excellent work he has done, which clears the way for a measure that specifically meets the needs of business, particularly of small businesses, and contributes to the process of completing the internal market. The interconnection of national companies registers is of fundamental assistance to firms wishing to open a branch in another Member State or simply do business with enterprises in other states. As well as increasing consumer and user confidence in cross-border transactions, this interconnection will result in saving businesses a potential EUR 69 billion of costs every year. What is more, this measure will increase legal certainty, which will help to solve one of the problems businesses face most often in their cross-border activities. Notwithstanding that the interconnection is of a purely technical nature, and will not therefore also extend to the legal consequences arising from the use of registers, the transparency and the reliability of the information that this will be able to provide and guarantee form the basis on which consumers and information users can exercise and defend their rights. In conclusion, I should point out that a special feature of this measure is that questions of a technical nature cannot be answered exhaustively. In other words, problems and the relevant solutions will arise and have to be developed in the course of the creation of the network. For this reason, the interconnection process will succeed only if, as I hope, the Commission and the Member States work together closely. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted in favour of this directive, which implements measures needed to protect the lives and freedoms of the victims of crime. To give an example: according to some estimates, there are about 100 000 women in Europe who benefit from protection orders. Such measures, however, are currently limited in their effect to the territory where they were adopted or in which the victims live. As a result, there is a legislative gap that this directive fills through the mutual recognition of protection orders in the context of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The instrument to be introduced shortly will, in fact, ensure that a protection order issued in one country will automatically be recognised in any Member State that the victim visits. This is an extremely important result, which, in practical terms, helps to create a European Union area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for in the Treaty. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, I voted for Ms Mathieu’s report since I strongly believe that immigration in Europe is a great opportunity, but that it must be managed intelligently and fairly. Without effective intervention, the labour market would be divided and a host of low-cost workers would threaten to undermine the achievements of the European social model. I therefore think this provision will help to prevent and control such a threat by creating a level playing field for the citizens of our countries and for third-country nationals; I am referring, for example, to access to the various kinds of advisory services that the host country makes available. Similarly, I am pleased with the compromises reached on access to education and training and on the portability and transferability of pensions and acquired pension rights, which will no longer depend on whether or not there are bilateral agreements between countries.

 Madam President, I am delighted at the adoption of Mr Lehne’s report, which at last provides for the exemption of micro-enterprises from pointless and often incomprehensible accounting obligations. That will enable each and every one of them to save an average of EUR 1 000 a year and cut their overheads by 25%. It is, in fact, superfluous and disproportionate to subject micro-enterprises that trade only locally or, at most, regionally to the same financial reporting requirements as large companies. Unfortunately, because of a blocking minority comprising a few Member States, the Council wants another two years to approve this measure. I sincerely hope that the Council will stop taking this attitude and we will not always need a crisis to occur for good proposals to be put into effect, when it comes to making life easier for small enterprises, which are a major engine for growth in Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even though all EU Member States should respect people’s right to a fair trial, national procedures on information in criminal proceedings vary considerably from one country to another. Some Member States provide for accused persons to receive only oral information about their procedural rights, while others provide information – especially if it is technical – only in writing or at the request of the accused. Since over 8 million criminal proceedings are brought in the European Union every year, it is easy to see that an information system that is still so varied and heterogeneous is inadequate. I therefore agree with the content and aims of this directive. I am referring especially to the general rule making it compulsory to provide accused persons with information about their procedural rights before proceedings begin, particularly the right to be assisted by a lawyer and to be able to benefit from official translations if the proceedings are in a different language. With regard to the stage after proceedings have begun, I agree with the two specific rights selected: the right of accused people to full information about the charges brought against them, and their right to access to the case file. These are two essential conditions for determining and challenging the lawfulness of the arrest or detention and for enabling them to put up the best possible defence. I therefore congratulate the Commissioner, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs on their work during the informal trialogues. These have led to the approval of measures that will harmonise the spread and development of fundamental rights, such as the right to a defence and the right to a fair trial.

To work towards achieving this goal I voted in favour of the report by Ms Paliadeli, in which I completely agree on the criteria for identifying the sites, which I think should take place transnationally and on a two-yearly basis, thereby boosting the quality of the process. Lastly, I fully agree with the role given to Parliament, which will be duly involved in the process of selecting the chosen sites. For one thing, Parliament has always supported the development of this label, firstly in the 2007 tourism resolution and then in the 2008 resolution on the European agenda for culture in a globalised world.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the complexity of the process of recognition, which affects an extremely high number of professions, is an obstacle to the circulation of European professionals and has negative effects on growth and competition. Therefore, I share Ms McClarkin’s view which aims to streamline administrative processes by creating registration systems and an online portal containing all the relevant information regarding procedures. I believe that the proposal to extend the Internal Market Information system to professions not yet open to the directive on services is valid and necessary. Finally, I hope for further development of the debate towards other and wider categories of professionals. I refer, in particular, to professions close to the world of business, which currently raises an often unnecessary barrier against cross-border exchanges, as in the case of legal and accounting professions. o o o Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mr Simon’s report since I fully agree with the urgency to bring more clarity and directness to the application of rules on State aid to services of general economic interest. In particular, I believe that there is widespread agreement on the urgency to draw up de minimis
 measures for services of general interest which do not substantially affect commerce between Member States. Having said this, I have some reservations on the approach chosen by the Commission. In fact, I believe that the excessive quantity of texts, between communications, decision and regulation, runs the risk of confusing the normative framework and of making it appear confused and difficult to understand rather than contributing to a genuine and functional updating of existing rules as required.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over 80 million people in Europe are threatened by poverty. The economic crisis has aggravated this situation, leaving the weakest fringes of society exposed. I have therefore voted in favour of Mr Daerden’s report; I particularly appreciated its comprehensiveness and the number of issues raised, making for an effective fight against poverty. I refer specifically to the close examination of cooperation between states, to the definition of common principles to establish the so-called ‘basket’ of goods and services that are essential and accessible to all, and to the fight against child poverty. In the same way, I agree with the lines of action drawn up by the Commission, in particular, the priority of better use of Structural Funds, which could play an essential role in the development of innovative approaches and of specific programmes in the fight against poverty.

 Madam President, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, in the field of innovation, European small and medium-sized enterprises are still suffering from slower growth than their counterparts in the United States and in other emerging economies. In this context, unitary patent protection can provide an excellent opportunity to boost the role of SMEs in the area of innovation and research, and contribute to the relaunch of the internal market at the same time. Therefore, I would like to ask whether you intend to propose, in the medium or short term, specific measures to facilitate the access of SMEs to the European patent market – for example, a European fund with the responsibility and power to pay registration fees on behalf of SMEs – and whether you believe that the legislative procedure under way can help and offers a good opportunity to attain this objective.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ADR (alternative dispute resolution) in civil, commercial and family matters is a valid alternative to the traditional confrontational approach between parties, offering an effective, inexpensive solution to disputes. I therefore support Ms Wallis’s horizontal approach, which extends the benefits of ADR to business-to-business civil and commercial transactions and to family disputes. That said, I hope that the Commission’s forthcoming legislative proposal will satisfy the key points highlighted by this Parliament: above all, the need to ensure a high level of impartiality and transparency of the systems, the application of ADR to electronic commerce by means of an online multilingual platform, and the promotion of ADR as a valid, cost-effective alternative to forms of collective redress.

 Mr President, public procurement can play a decisive role for the EU budget: indeed, public expenditure on works, goods and services accounts for roughly 17% of EU GDP and almost a fifth of this expenditure – approximately EUR 420 billion – falls within the scope of the EU directives on public procurement. I would therefore congratulate Ms Rühle for setting out what I believe to be the red lines of the forthcoming reform of the directive on public procurement: in particular, I am referring to the criterion of lowest price, which can no longer be the determining one for the award of contracts and should be replaced by the criterion of most economically advantageous tender in terms of economic, social and environmental benefits. Similarly, I agree entirely with the urgent need to simplify the rules in order to make procurement procedures simpler, less cumbersome and more in line with the needs of SMEs and small contracting authorities. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis has shown that the Stability and Growth Pact is not working as it should. Six Member States, three of which are in the euro area, are having budgetary problems and risk defaulting on their debt. This is a situation that we must urgently put an end to. It is important, however, that this be done in a way that is sustainable and with a view to the future. That is why I voted in favour of the Goulard report, whose approach of using sanctions I approve of, particularly with respect to manipulation of financial data, falsified statistics or misleading information on the part of a Member State. At the same time, however, future efforts must be directed at what is the heart of the problem, namely the insufficient degree of economic integration within the European Union. Sanctions will have a merely cursory dissuasive effect if we do not reinforce the bonds forged by single economic policies by increasing the number of surveillance missions by the Commission, and in the medium term, the use of Eurobonds. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having regular access to up-to-date and reliable budgetary data is the key to regulating public spending and enabling the swift adoption of corrective measures in times of crisis. I therefore agree on the need to allow the Commission to monitor, with the help of a fiscal body, individual Member States’ compliance with budgetary rules. Having said that, I must point out that, under the Treaty, the establishment of a medium-term financial framework leaves the way clear for newly elected governments to amend the programming decisions that were previously taken. This directive must therefore be applied to the letter, and the Commission must constantly monitor its application. This is to ensure that intervention has a tangible rather than superficial effect and that it helps to achieve the directive’s primary objective: uniform compliance with budgetary discipline as stipulated by the Treaty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Thursday evening, the Bundestag
 will vote on the agreement of 21 July, while in the very near future, we expect to receive the Troika’s report on the situation in Greece. Essentially, Mr Juncker, a number of economists are accusing us, together with European leaders and European institutions, of wasting precious time in saving the euro. We have reached a crossroads for Europe and for our currency. In this light, what can we expect from the meeting of the Eurogroup Economic and Financial Affairs Council on 3 October? Do you believe that a solution is possible? If so, which solution and with what kind of political support? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union continues to move forward at too slow a pace in the area of science, and is not catching up with the United States and Japan, who are the leaders in this field. On average the 27 Member States invest 2% of GDP in research and development, rather than respecting the 3% target set by the Commission. As a result the publication of the Green Paper by the European Commission seems even more opportune, as it enables us to actively revive the discussion, as described by the excellent report by Ms Matias. I second the request made by the rapporteur concerning the establishment of an all-European common fund to promote collaborative research in the European Union and reduce inequality among Member States. At the same time I believe it is essential that any measure is preceded by a doubling of the research and innovation programme budget for the financing period from 2014. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the successful implementation of Directive 2008/52/EC shows that mediation is a viable alternative to the traditional adversarial approach, in that it allows for the amicable settlement of disputes and thus reduces the workload of the courts. This is confirmed by the various initiatives taken by some Member States, which are encouraging, where possible, the use of mediation through financial incentives or legislative provisions. In view of that, I should like to draw attention to certain aspects that I believe deserve further thought and consideration, starting with the issue of costs: we should follow the example of Member States that have tackled this problem by providing financial incentives to use mediation. I also believe that we need to explore other possibilities, such as the use of awareness campaigns to promote the use and understanding of alternative forms of dispute resolution, especially on the part of businesses. In order to achieve this objective, it is necessary also, and above all, to involve members of the legal system, who must see the added value of mediation as something that enhances, rather than competes with, their work. Lastly, looking ahead to the forthcoming Commission communication on the implementation of the directive and, in particular, to the imminent legislative proposal on alternative dispute resolution, I should like to emphasise the way in which mediation complements other reforms of EU law, in particular, the approach to forms of collective redress and to contract law. Indeed, as a preliminary measure, mediation can be an excellent alternative to forms of collective redress and can make an important contribution to the future instrument on contract law, significantly reducing the use of dispute resolution mechanisms.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their excellent work, which offers some interesting points of departure for increasing the quality and effectiveness of European legislative activity. I shall restrict myself to highlighting a number of aspects which I think are especially significant: it is absolutely essential to achieve a 25% cut in red tape, which can only be achieved through greater collaboration between the Commission and the Member States on measures designed to avoid diverging interpretations and the resulting ‘gold-plating’ of transposed legislation. With the same objective in mind, we need to ensure high quality correlation tables between directives and national transposition measures and we need to carry out retrospective assessments of the legislation implemented on a more frequent basis. These are essential measures for ensuring that EU legislation achieves its primary goal, which is meeting the expectations of EU citizens, the businesses operating on the single market, and national and local governments. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, a little less than a year ago, Parliament adopted the new directive to combat late payments. This was a vital recast which, by imposing firm deadlines on payments made by public administrations, satisfies the requests made by businesses and citizens and amounts to a formidable counter-cyclical measure that will also combat unemployment, which is laying waste to our countries. I would point out in this regard that one in four businesses fail due to late payments by public administrations, with the resulting loss of many jobs. Member States must transpose this new legislation not later than 16 March 2013. I would therefore like to ask Mr Tajani what measures the Commission is taking to ensure proper transposition of the directive into the various national legal systems and to facilitate the early entry into force of the directive, as promised by a number of Member States? Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her work and the contents of her report, with which I am in complete agreement. I believe that only an optional instrument to be adopted by means of a regulation can adequately fulfil the objectives of the whole reform of European contract law. Moreover, an optional instrument should neither harmonise nor replace national contract laws but rather work alongside them as an alternative instrument that offers freedom of choice to contracting parties. Therefore, I do not agree with the proposals put forward by those who would prefer to limit the scope of this instrument so that it applies only to e-commerce contracts, as this would create an artificial and, above all, unnecessary distinction between online and face to face transactions. Our task as legislators is not to limit the legal nature of the regulation on the basis of speculation or market projections but rather to ensure legal certainty and to lay the foundations for a common legal language in the field of commerce. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 One necessary component of effective enforcement of judgments is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor’s assets and to freeze them. Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors may evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thus denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market. That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system, by which I mean an additional, autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts. This preventive measure will also provide a further deterrent against payment delays and will force the disclosure of assets in cross-border claims. Raffaele Baldassare,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the Single Market Act lies in its desire to satisfy the needs of the market, facilitating access and participation of all those involved: businesses, consumers and workers. Given this ambitious goal, I am satisfied with the interventions proposed by Mr Barnier and the indications provided by this Parliament. In my opinion, some priorities are imperative for achieving the objectives that the EU has proposed, in particular: improving the access of small and medium-sized enterprises in the domestic market, reducing their administrative obligations and facilitating their participation in contract bidding procedures, removing all obstacles to the development of electronic commerce, and supporting and financing innovation, particularly through the issuance of bonds for European Union projects, especially in energy, transport and telecommunications. Finally, only by connecting development and support for the business world with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy regarding employment can we achieve what I believe to be the aim of this act, namely, to create a social market economy based on growth, competitiveness and sustainability.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your speech and the list of measures announced, and will not enter into the legal and regulatory debate on temporary protection of migrants and the application of Article 80 of the Treaty. As we speak, unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast, their passengers often paying with their lives. Despite the recent transfers, Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria. Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people, while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations. Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow, but we cannot continue to go it alone. We need the European Union, we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration, starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Schwab on the work he has done so far and the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Providing for varying degrees of harmonisation of standards will allow us to achieve important results, which will provide real added value for European citizens. Significant among these are the fourteen-day right of withdrawal and the new rules on information requirements, not only on price but also on the identity and address of the seller. These improvements will increase consumer confidence, especially in cross-border shopping by providing the legal certainties essential for the development of e
-commerce. This directive will also lay the foundation for other complementary measures, from the reform of European contract law to the process of reviewing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This fundamental harmonisation action is an essential condition for the development of an internal market focused on the rights of its consumers and serving the citizens of the European Union. About a year ago, Professor Monti said in his report to President Barroso: ‘Consumers and consumer welfare should be at the centre of the next stage of the single market’. First, the law-maker should reach early agreement on the draft directive on consumer rights, to ensure a high level of protection in an integrated retail market. This provision fully meets the demands, and I am convinced that Mr Schwab will maintain the necessary determination in the complex negotiations that will follow before the final adoption of the text.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this report and I should like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Járóka for the work she has done. She managed to bring together the different positions and establish clear objectives and priorities for the strategy; namely, the provision of specific measures against nomadic lifestyles, guarantees on basic healthcare, equal access to primary, secondary and higher education, and the right to housing. The strategy actually aims at inclusion and not merely integration. It is obvious that the role of the Commission and local authorities will be crucial, above all, in terms of controlling and managing European Union funds. The only limitation of this report is the lack of instruments to check the actual desire for integration amongst some Roma communities and the consequences that are likely to stem from any unwillingness to remain on the territory of a Member State or participate in the treatments, and the aid and welfare programmes, which certainly cannot continue ad infinitum
 without producing results. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although some excellent results have been achieved so far on the road towards European integration, there remain some gaps in fundamental areas for the development of a democratic system and full confirmation of the rule of law. Despite the progress made with the amendments to the legislation on criminal procedures and other primary laws, some aspects are still substantially behind schedule. I refer, in particular, to the urgent need to ensure the responsibility and efficiency of the judiciary, as well as its transparency, not to mention that of the public prosecutor’s office, and their independence from political interference. To that end, substantial changes are needed to the system for appointing judges and public prosecutors, putting an end to the practice whereby their appointments only take place in parliament and within the government. Lastly, (...) to improve access to justice and to free legal assistance. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 The market in services represents two thirds of the gross domestic product and two thirds of jobs in the European Union, but even so, only a fifth of total intra-EU trade. All the same, I can only agree with the priorities enumerated by the rapporteur and, in particular, as regards the completion of the points of single contact and the strengthening of administrative cooperation. As things stand, the first generation of points of single contact exists in 22 Member States. This would appear to afford us some comfort, were it not for the fact that in only 14 of them is it possible to complete the process online. On the contrary, it is essential that points of single contact become an integral part of greater e-government in the EU, making the offering available in different languages. Finally, it is essential to strengthen administrative cooperation so that the whole of this communication-based system can function efficiently. The Internal Market Information System (IMI) has already become a vitally important tool. It supports the work done by administrations, enables different administrative methods to be coordinated and deficient information to be supplemented. In spite of this, monitoring will, in future, be necessary to make sure that this system is not only used but also, and above all, correctly applied. Raffaele Baldassarre,  
on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with exceptional speed and dynamism, this Parliament is about to consent to the first instance of enhanced cooperation that specifically concerns the internal market. The accepted justification for this is that the discussion on a European patent has been on the agenda for many years. We should therefore do well to specify that the draft regulation on the translation regime was not adopted by the Commission until 30 June 2010 and that the Council took note of the lack of unanimity and the difficulty of reaching a unanimous decision in the near future in November 2010. I shall gloss over, then, the pace at which we in Parliament have dealt with the dossier, which I hope will serve as an example for the future, because we have broken records of some significance in favour of a speedy and efficient legislative passage. Nevertheless, since it is not my intention to act solely as a spokesman for the interests of my country, which is currently opposed to enhanced cooperation, and since I believe that the subject of the patent is fundamental to the development of industry and the European entrepreneurial system, I should like merely to raise certain questions that I consider to be important for the exercise by this House of its legislative functions and for the future treatment of regulations on the patent. First and foremost, we should do well to recognise that a vote in favour of enhanced cooperation will systematically legitimise the application to the development of the internal market of an instrument that should instead have the quality of a last resort. We are therefore creating a precedent that could be used in all areas of the internal market. Furthermore, I believe that this Parliament can, when we are faced with other subjects, subsequently state its view in a manner that is exhaustive and autonomous, and that individual proposals are at the centre of users’ and businesses’ interests rather than those of individual groups of countries. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, Mr Leterme, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am pleased to have had a Presidency that has proved able to manage the European agenda in a pragmatic and effective way, albeit at a difficult time. From the adoption at first reading of the recast of the directive on combating late payment in public administration, which is fundamental to the future of the system of undertakings, to the adoption of the financial supervision package, the Belgian Presidency has proved to be both practical and dynamic. I could cite other examples, but I prefer to draw conclusions about what can be learnt from a Presidency that has concluded its term of office in a positive way. Firstly, one has to have a realistic work programme; secondly, one has to be able to negotiate dynamically and reach compromises; and, lastly, one has to fully involve the European institutions, starting with Parliament, and take an approach to outstanding issues that is free from constraints and national interests. I hope that this Presidency will serve as an example to the others that follow it. For now though, I offer it my most sincere congratulations. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly do not intend for my speech to deny the seriousness of a situation that is the inevitable outcome of obvious administrative and political failings, which have been – and still are – in danger of burying an entire city and its surroundings in waste. Mr Søndergaard and Mrs Lichtenberger, the crisis in Campania initially began and then developed so dramatically because of the inability of a regional council and a left-wing Naples city council, together with aldermen from the Greens, to take decisions – including unpopular and brave decisions – to create an environmentally friendly waste collection and disposal system. Irresponsibility, indecision, political gain, sinister collusion and waste characterised a political and administrative phase that is now definitively over. I want to reassure those who tabled the oral questions and the political groups that supported them that the political situation is viable and has completely changed. The national government and the new regional council have shouldered their responsibilities and have the political determination to resolve the crisis. Through a dialogue with the populations concerned and with the necessary resolve, they are overcoming obstacles and objections that are often caused by Nimby Syndrome, or the idea that people do not want others’ rubbish in their backyard. As a result, they have drawn up an integrated waste collection and disposal plan that will shortly provide incentives for separate collection and the construction of the necessary facilities. It would therefore be extremely unfair, counterproductive and exploitative to do as Mr De Magistris is requesting: imposing inhibitory penalties and measures today would harm institutions that are cooperating fully with the European Union as they attempt to close this terrible chapter in the age-old history of Naples and Campania through the efficient use of European and national resources. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, we find ourselves discussing what is a terrible contradiction for the European Union, which aims to ensure full freedom of movement for its citizens and to work for their needs. This contradiction reveals some people’s genuine need for help and the inability of others to offer the help requested. The paradox of the difficulties and obstacles that hinder international adoption translates into a tragedy for thousands of children and families in the European Union. The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption. On the one hand, this is down to the specific provisions of each convention and their exclusive nature. However, on the other hand, the limited efforts made thus far are a result of the intergovernmental nature of the existing decision-making structures and processes. The Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights today form the legal benchmarks and, naturally, the political approach is changing. The protection and wellbeing of children is one of the cornerstones of the rights safeguarded by the Union. This is the basis of today’s debate and the oral question submitted, which forms the backdrop for a broader discussion that should be very dear to the heart of Parliament and should be carried out swiftly and carefully by this Parliament, and followed with the tenacity that Mrs Angelilli has shown. Allow me to recall Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who said: ‘All grown-ups were children once – although few of them remember it’. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating a European identity and increasing citizens’ interest in the European Union and its origins are two challenges that the European institutions must face up to in order to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity. Furthermore, these challenges are at the heart of the goals of the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, Article 3 of the Treaty establishes the EU’s obligation to safeguard European cultural development. If the European dream is going through a difficult phase at the moment, this is not only down to the impasse
 regarding Europe as a political project, or the ongoing economic crisis, but is also due to the difficulties faced by a Union founded on an as yet unresolved identity. In this situation, it is more necessary than ever to reduce the gap between the European Union and its citizens, bringing the multinational yet shared cultural heritage of the European Union to its citizens and, above all, to future generations. This is the meaning and importance of a European Heritage Label: to bring Europe together in its diversity, promoting a shared culture and favouring integration between the places involved within its territory. In order to realise this objective, the new label will focus on the symbolic educational value rather than on the aesthetic beauty of a site, favouring cooperation between sites and supporting joint projects amongst them. I should therefore like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mrs Paliadeli and the rest of the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular, with regard to the procedure for selecting the sites and strengthening the role of the European Parliament during the selection process. I am sure that the Member States’ decision to insert the label within the framework of the European Union will contribute to increasing its visibility and prestige, so as to realise the objectives of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on Mr Szájer’s report tomorrow, we will give the go-ahead for one of the new instruments – on implementing acts – contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. This will simplify the old comitology system. It is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts, regulating methods of control by Member States over the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission. The fundamental importance of the Regulation has made the legislative procedure complicated both at inter-institutional level and within Parliament where, however, because of the involvement – albeit belated – of all committees, I hope it will be possible to adopt the proposal at first reading. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Szájer, for succeeding in achieving the priority objectives for the European Parliament: I refer to the guarantees to align the current comitology procedures with the new procedure, the right to scrutiny by Parliament and the Council, the creation of an appeal committee chaired by the Commission and the inclusion of a review clause that will make it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the procedure. Allow me a final comment on what was the last obstacle to the negotiations: the inclusion of the common commercial policy within the scope of the future Regulation. Although the final agreement will allow the application of a simple majority voting system for the adoption of anti-dumping measures during a transitional period of 18 months, subsequently the measures will be adopted by qualified majority. This solution was the outcome of a difficult compromise but I am convinced that it satisfies both the needs of industry and the European Union executive, removing decisions of a technical nature from the risk of dangerous politicisation.

 Mr President, after the adoption of the Council decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service, we are today called on to make that decision operational by amending the Financial Regulation and the Staff Regulations of Union officials. In that respect, I would like to focus on an aspect of the report that has involved us in difficult negotiations: the issue of geographical balance in the composition of the European diplomatic corps. Some Members would, in fact, have preferred different criteria for the selection of staff, based on country of origin and citizenship. Such proposals have been avoided by means of balanced compromise amendments, which have been able to take geographical and gender balance into account without imposing country-based selection criteria. The selection of country-based quotas would not, in fact, have been a suitable or desirable solution. After over 50 years of European integration, the Union’s first real diplomatic corps is now being created. It has to be put in a position to be able to develop a common foreign policy and serve the Union’s interests on the international stage. For it to accomplish this task, it is crucial that its staff represent the Union and not the Member States of which they are citizens or have been diplomatic officers. That is the line that the Committee on Legal Affairs took yesterday when adopting the Rapkay report, and that is the line that I hope will continue to be taken in the vote in plenary. Raffaele Baldassarre,  
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Mr Tajani, Mrs Weiler, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased and proud to have contributed to the adoption of this directive on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs. It is a vital counter-cyclical measure which provides very real support to companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by laying down definite payment terms and appropriate penalties to encourage punctual payment by both public authorities and private enterprise in the European Union. If everyone involved paid their debts on time, the European economy would receive a cash injection worth EUR 300 billion. Our market will not be common and our competition will not be fair until uniform rules are established that apply to everybody. That is the motivation behind the new directive on combating late payment: it forces public authorities to be more efficient and virtuous in their actions and helps the internal market and free competition to develop homogeneously, to the benefit of SMEs. This House has been able to make a decisive contribution to this successful outcome by overcoming all kinds of pressure and divisions for the sake of the general good of the people and of the European production system.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg’s report highlights a fundamental question for the EU integration process: the need to make simple, clear laws that EU citizens can understand. I cannot fail to agree with the key objectives identified by the rapporteur, in particular respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the importance accorded to the impact assessments and to reducing administrative burdens. With regard to the impact assessments, I am keen to stress that the Committee on Legal Affairs is actively working so that the European Commission can develop mechanisms to provide guarantees and ensure the independence of the analyses carried out. This is a fundamental question: ensuring higher standards for the impartiality of the assessments would give the EU’s legislative proposals greater credibility, and would simplify the process for their adoption. Furthermore, I consider it vital to work towards a clear reduction of the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation. The European Commission would like to reduce these burdens by 25% by 2012, which would entail an increase in the level of EU GDP of 1.4%, equivalent to EUR 150 billion. A substantial part of EU administrative burdens stems, in fact, from the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of administrative procedures implemented at national level. To give an example: 72 EU legislative acts have imposed 486 information obligations, which have led to the adoption in the Member States of more than 10 000 implementing acts. While on the one hand, increased monitoring is required during the transposition of Union law, on the other, greater collaboration by the Council and the individual Member States is essential. To conclude, I think that, leaving aside matters concerning the principle of subsidiarity, closer cooperation with national parliaments can provide a decisive contribution towards making EU laws more effective and ultimately bringing them closer in line with the needs of EU citizens.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new guidelines to promote employment constitute a fundamental step towards economic recovery and growth in Europe. The meltdown has triggered a significant rise in the unemployment rate. In 2010, this figure reached 9.6%, and 20.3% for youth unemployment; in other words, millions and millions of people are unemployed. Yet unemployment is only part of the problem. Indeed, the task is not simply to create new jobs but to improve and preserve the ones that already exist. To achieve the goals set out in the report, we also need a structural change in the economy. In this respect, despite the considerable efforts expended by the rapporteur, Mr Őry, Parliament’s response to the statistics I have just mentioned remains general and unfocused, and this is to the detriment of the European strategy. Indicators and key targets are not enough. It is not enough to use terms such as ‘coordinate’, ‘dialogue’ and ‘collaborate’. A pact between generations is not enough. We need a European policy that meets the needs of its citizens. The limits imposed by budget policies must be overturned by more specific, development-oriented public planning. We must direct the actions we take today towards helping young people and future generations; we need training and education policies that allow for investment in human capital in order to improve its quality and to connect it to the labour market. We need to make choices that will help the production system. To sum up: we need less paperwork, more investment and clearer economic choices. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Interconnecting business registers is an essential prerequisite for promoting integration of the economic area within the EU and for improving legal certainty for businesses and consumers. Mr Lechner’s report picks out very clearly what are the priority measures that are indispensable for making the law more certain and for making cross-border economic transactions more transparent. Firstly, it is vital that interconnecting registers and access to data take place in a single framework. To this end, it will be necessary to strengthen and develop the potential offered by the BRITE interconnection project in order that a single portal can be established through which all our citizens can obtain information on European businesses. Secondly, it will be vital that it is adopted with a view to making integration of business registers compulsory for all Member States, so that all states take part as soon as possible. This is because the success of any project that aims to achieve a harmonious development of the internal market requires the participation of all interested parties so that it can be made compulsory as soon as the technical standards have been fully developed.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Albania is a fundamental factor in the stability of the Western Balkans and in the EU enlargement process. The country is taking important steps to develop democracy, improve infrastructures and transition to an open and competitive economy. However, Albania’s path to the European Union is still blocked by the difficult stabilisation of the party system, due, in part, to the obstructive behaviour of the opposition, which has a negative impact on the development and approval of structural reforms. The economy is still being held back by an uncertain legal framework, widespread illegality, a large informal economy and inadequate energy and transport systems. Italy has played, and still plays, an important role in the stabilisation of Albania: Italy is its main trade partner, main investor and main benefactor – 430 000 Albanians live in Italy. However, these forms of collaboration need to be supported by European action, with cooperation on a macro-regional basis, such as Adriatic-Ionian cooperation, to help pave the way for Europe in the Mediterranean.

rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has confronted us with the evidence that greater coordination at European level is an absolute priority for the development and stability of the financial markets. That said, I shall limit myself here to highlighting one fundamental issue, particularly in the light of the difficult trialogues still ongoing. If giving financial oversight authorities the power to adopt individual, directly binding decisions – as provided for in Article 10 of the regulations – responds to the political desire to react quickly to emergency situations, then in the case of daily supervision, this power conflicts with Articles 17 and 258 of the treaty, which state that it is the exclusive power of the Commission to ensure the application of the law of the Union. Furthermore, in this case, a paradoxical situation would be created in which the Member States, present in the highest body through their own authorities, would be indirectly responsible for applying the law of the Union. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I proposed a compromise amendment which attempts to resolve this discrepancy between the powers conferred on the authorities and the role and competences of the Commission, in full compliance with the treaty. I hope that the contribution of the Legal Affairs Committee can be used as a basis for any further compromises with the other European institutions in order to arrive swiftly at a much needed solution, which is completely in accordance with the law of the Union.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal and the position adopted by the rapporteur leave the Member States free to choose whether or not to include self-employed workers in the scope of the directive. This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules. By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules. Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition. Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost. It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks. In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers’ health and safety.

 The proposal for a draft Framework Decision establishes fundamental obligations based on the European Convention on Human Rights and European Court case law. The right to interpretation and translation is essential for those who must defend themselves in a criminal trial and cannot speak the language of the proceeding. Moreover, under Article 6 of the Treaty, the Union respects the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which upholds the right to a fair trial. The text we are discussing today is a satisfactory and fully acceptable compromise. In the compromise solutions, the Presidency in fact safeguarded the essential points indicated by Member States with regard to costs arising from implementation of the directive and the transposition period. In the light of all this, I am pleased by the results achieved within the Council and European Parliament: interpretation must be offered in the mother tongue of the suspect or in a language known to the suspect, while translation will be offered only for the essential documents and the possibility of drawing up oral summaries of the main documents will be considered.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the creation of the Union and the holding of the summit of Heads of State or Government, we still lack a clear definition of EU Mediterranean policy and a long-term strategic vision for the development and stabilisation of the region. Yet the Mediterranean has enormous potential: one third of global maritime traffic now passes through Mediterranean waters, coming from China, Asia, European countries, India, reaching our waters via the Suez Canal. The coastal countries of the Middle East and of Africa are advanced developing countries and for us, they are vital in certain fundamental areas, including that of migration flows. We must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean, providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects. The key points include agriculture, transport, maritime highways, transnational corridors, renewable energy and the Solar Plan. In the words of Paul Morand, a French diplomat and writer, the Mediterranean is, above all, the anti-desert civilisation. Let us reassert these words. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last two years have left millions of unemployed people in their wake, have been the cause of further national debt that will remain for many years still, and have put renewed pressure on and new tears in our social cohesion. We must react in a timely and incisive manner, and, in order to avoid making the errors of judgment that the Lisbon Strategy succumbed to, Europe 2020 must be extremely realistic in its objectives and balanced in the goals it sets itself. Three of these seem to me, Commissioner, to be priorities. The first is certainly a stable currency and stable national budgets, which, however, must not be divorced from development and economic growth. We need investment in research and innovation to make our industries ever more competitive and our products of the highest quality. We must support SMEs and new industries, such as IT and sustainable energy and, of course, our infrastructure. Let us raise the overall level of education, yes, but chiefly we must mould training to the needs of the labour market and production. It is a paradox that businesses are still demanding specialisms that the market is in no position to offer. It is clear that every target should be related to the national context, but within the framework of a broader European strategy. I shall conclude by saying that the Greek crisis and the economic and employment crisis in the whole of Europe testify to the fact that in order to safeguard social cohesion, development and stable national budgets, we need strong and solid economic governance at the European level, to enable European institutions, including Parliament, to take effective and preventive action.

– Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Szájer for the outstanding work delivered in so little time. The delegated acts will be of paramount importance for Union law and the interinstitutional balance in the EU. Therefore, it is fundamental that they are developed and decided upon in a fully transparent manner which effectively enables the Parliament and the Council to democratically control the exercise of the power delegated to the Commission. To this extent, as advocated by the Szájer report, some issues will be of utmost importance and require our stronger commitment. These include, inter alia, the possibility for the European Parliament to revoke the delegation at any time and to make sure that Parliament and Council are conferred the same rights concerning their involvement in the process of delegation. Finally, I would like to stress that it should be a priority for the Commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis
 to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291, including the acquis
 in policy areas which, pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty, are now subject to the codecision procedure. Raffaele Baldassarre,

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, needle-stick and other sharp injuries are among the most common risks faced by healthcare workers in Europe, and they therefore represent a serious problem both for the healthcare sector and for society in general. The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers’ Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions. The main aim of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or pointed objects used in medicine. This agreement therefore represents an important step towards an increase in safety within the hospital sector. As we all agree, the consequences of sharp injuries can be extremely serious and can cause the spread of diseases such as viral hepatitis and AIDS. That being said, I must stress the need for an integrated and, at the same time, realistic approach to this problem. In this respect I believe that the administrative, financial and legal constraints deriving from the agreement should not be excessive and therefore should not be such as to harm the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the healthcare sector, or else these enterprises could have serious difficulties in complying with the terms of the agreement. Just as commendable, moreover, is the anticipated – to ‘anticipated’ I would add ‘desirable’ – option for the Member States to adopt more effective provisions and measures than those contained in the agreement with the aim of protecting workers. Lastly, I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament, which often focuses on this issue, so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the microfinance facility for employment is part of a set of initiatives that have been adopted at European level, and it gives the unemployed an opportunity for a new start and opens the door to entrepreneurship for some of Europe’s most disadvantaged groups, including, of course, the young. The new facility should extend the range of targeted financial support to new entrepreneurs in the current context of a reduced credit supply. Individual entrepreneurs and founders of micro-enterprises will also be assisted by way of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building, in addition to interest-rate support from the European Social Fund. It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis. Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment. It is, however, necessary that the transfer of Progress funds remains unchanged, in the sense that we cannot give the signal to divert resources from the Progress programme. These resources need to be found from other sources and, above all, need to be associated with other European initiatives, so that we project a strong image and make a strong effort in favour of the unemployed in Europe.

The Treaty of Lisbon substantially changes the institutional balances that were originally outlined by the Treaty of Maastricht concerning police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by including, though with substantial exceptions, the ordinary legislative procedure relating to the area of freedom, security and justice. It is therefore necessary for any amendment to the measures implementing the Europol decision to be adopted within the new legislative framework envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Europol cannot be strengthened unless Parliament is able to express itself properly on regulations relating to measures that are not purely technical but political, such as the transfer of personal data. Allow me to add a thought concerning the European Union’s increasingly outward-looking stance and the increased synergy between internal security and defence. Even if the treaty has no immediate effect on the development of security and defence markets, it paves the way for the development of a more integrated and consistent security market, which requires legislative actions that are coordinated and therefore interinstitutional. It would therefore be all the more inconsistent, if not indeed harmful, to adopt ‘political’ amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision that do not follow the legislative procedure envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon. Raffaele Baldassarre  (PPE

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both proposals fully transfer to the Commission the powers which, until now, have been held by the Council. With the impending entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the consequent abolition of the pillar-based Community structure, the legal situation will be profoundly different and significantly modified. Therefore, the evaluation mechanism will have to be based on a consistent allocation of the tasks currently shared between the first and the third pillars. This is why I feel it is essential that the proposal provides for greater involvement of the Member States – I do not believe, Mr Barrot, that the involvement of experts is sufficient – and, above all, true involvement, true participation of the European Parliament within the coordinating group of the mechanism to monitor and verify the proper application of the Schengen acquis
. Furthermore, in my opinion, we should determine and better define, by means of more comprehensive, more precise criteria, how to use the migratory pressure parameter, which pinpoints the areas of greatest risk where unannounced visits should take place. Lastly, the proposals should be treated as a single package and not separately, since they both represent common aspects of the same issue and have the same shortcomings. This is also because, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the applicable procedure will be codecision. I therefore fully support the position set out by Mr Coelho and the calls on the Commission to withdraw these proposals and submit other, better ones, which take into account what has come out of this debate.

‘Finning’, or the removal the fins of sharks on board vessels, with the remaining parts of the animal’s body being thrown into the sea, has been banned in the EU since 2003. In order to put an end to this practice, it should be made mandatory for sharks to be landed with their fins still naturally attached to their body. Many fishing boats in the Mediterranean Sea practice finning since the sought-after shortfin mako and blue shark are both common, although these species might soon be listed as threatened with extinction. Illegal fishing is on the rise in the Mediterranean, in part due to the high demand for shark fins and the prices that they command. This type of non-sustainable fishing causes serious damage to the marine ecosystem, especially in recent years in the Mediterranean, where there is evidence that a number of shark populations have been affected by the practice. Greater cooperation is required in order to combat this illegal practice on board fishing vessels. To this end, the Member States must step up controls both at sea and in port, preventing the bodies of sharks from being thrown into the sea. Finning must be made transparent, controlled and above all regulated, so that it can be considered a sustainable and non-invasive form of fishing. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Enlargement represents the future of the European Union in order to ensure cohesion and integration. The recent financial crisis has highlighted the interdependence of national economies, both within and beyond the EU. It is therefore important to consolidate relations, especially in the economic area, with candidate and potential candidate countries. It is essential to create a climate of harmony and conciliation between different nations and peoples, encouraging economic cultural and religious dialogue. The peaceful resolution of conflicts and the establishment of good neighbourly relations between European countries are essential to sustainable peace and stability and contribute substantially to a genuine European integration process. It is important to give adequate priority within enlargement policy to the building of an efficient, independent and impartial judicial system, effectively fighting corruption, money laundering and organised crime. Enlargement must remain a credible policy, based on democracy, human rights and reconciliation. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the ‘better law-making’ initiative we discussed back in September served as a basis for this second sympathetic report from the rapporteur. The Treaty of Lisbon has undoubtedly given Parliament additional powers at an important time for European integration. Nevertheless, law-making, in concrete terms, remains out of kilter with citizens’ expectations. All this clearly requires careful monitoring and increased cooperation, based on the confidence demonstrated by European institutions in individual Member States to guarantee the uniform and homogeneous application of EU law in all 27 Member States. Law-making must be clearly informed by clarity, transparency and coherence, with respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, but at the same time it needs to challenge the fact that some Member States are somewhat unwilling to support this integration process, which is particularly significant from a legislative perspective. We therefore need workable tools that facilitate the transposition process and allow further judicial cooperation, on the assumption that the infringement procedure is the symptom of a pathology that must be cured by force. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that better legislation is an ongoing goal both of Parliament and of the institutional bodies that contribute, through colegislative powers, to giving a sufficiently clear and orderly framework for the more than 500 million EU citizens that expect clear, accessible and consistent laws. Indeed, consistency is not just a political issue but must translate in real life into legislation that meets this fundamental requirement. It is important to highlight that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, this requirement is best met by close cooperation with national parliaments. We need appropriate criteria for assessing the correct application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and, above all, we need the will to work out whether eight weeks are enough time for Member States to give the opinion it is their right to express. Institutional websites providing information for citizens are helpful, but we also need greater engagement from local bodies and regional levels of government. Lastly, evidence-based policy making may be combined with impact assessments on the legislative process to measure its effectiveness. All of this contributes to building a properly simplified framework to avoid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing more costs than they do already and ensures that the gap between Brussels and Strasbourg, and between Member States and citizens, is reduced. A Europe of citizens with the EU institutions genuinely at their service is what Parliament must aim to make into a reality. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, the four reports that have been adopted today clearly demonstrate Parliament’s desire to make a decisive contribution to supporting the fisheries sector, which is currently beset by major difficulties. I voted in favour because I feel there is a vital need for coordinated action, just as I also believe that an approach involving regionalisation is absolutely essential in order to tailor this action to the needs of individual areas. We need to trim down the industry, expand market opportunities, enable fleets to modernise and ensure that there is real modernisation and growth in the sector, in which environmental sustainability must go hand in hand with economic profitability. We await the framework regulation and finally the implementing dossier on the funding for the further acceleration that we think is needed. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 – (IT)
 Mr President, I voted in favour of this dossier because I believe that the issue of energy efficiency, together with sustainability and competitiveness, can certainly be an essential instrument in a particularly difficult process, such as this one. We need sustainable growth that has to involve small and medium-sized enterprises and that can be used as a virtuous cycle, including through innovative green technology. All this must be achieved through a culture of design that makes the best use of these resources, channelling them towards building refurbishment, which, in particular, requires the full and appropriate use of EU cohesion funds. One third of buildings in Europe were built after 1973, which is clearly significant. It is possible to act within this context, including by means of better training and design that is consistent with the aims of the provision. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 I voted in favour of Mr Färm’s report because I consider financing infrastructure projects in the field of transport and energy to be of crucial importance in achieving the objectives of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, as laid down by Europe 2020. As highlighted many times by the Commission and by Parliament, developing the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), trans-European energy network (TEN-E) and telecommunication infrastructures is part of the overall and necessary framework to relaunch EU employment and investment. Therefore, adequate support for financial resources guarantees the project will go ahead, and so acts as a catalyst for private investors, for whom uncertain risk perceptions and the ceaseless advance of the global economic crisis block the flow of finance. The construction of new modern and integrated infrastructures is fundamental if Europe is to remain a competitive, central player on the world stage and a leader in the post-crisis international economy. Building new infrastructures will create an enabling environment for a striving and competitive European private sector, stimulating growth, creating jobs for young people and engaging future generations in the relaunch of our economy, thus addressing some of the most pressing challenges our continent is facing today.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for and have supported this measure, because I think it is in line with the overall strategy to develop a sector that is still really struggling and is affected by huge market volatility, environmental challenges and the need to ensure environmental safety. I would say that the limit on aid to individual farmers is right, that the incentives for greening to help these new processes develop and inject competitiveness into the sector are good, and that so is the support for young people. This is an important, meaningful programme that also affects small entrepreneurs. What we really need is development. Simplified, leaner procedures that ensure direct payment are vital, to ensure that a sector that finds itself in great difficulty has a chance for real development. That is why I voted in favour and why I have supported an intervention that also allows for direct payments to young farmers to give them a chance and an opportunity to take the initiative and develop their business, which could bring significant results in terms of employment that the European Union cannot ignore.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure also falls within a wider context of a joint strategic framework on agriculture. It is an important intervention that ties in with the others also adopted in today’s sitting. We have, however, observed – including in light of the information provided by Mr De Castro – that the Council’s stance on opposing delegated acts constitutes an unwarranted removal of Parliament’s competences and powers. Inter-institutional dialogue would, instead, force the Council to take a more flexible stance. Simplification on EU funds and the possible use of the Structural Funds are important issues, as are the preservation of ecosystems, better organisation of the agri-food sector, improved attractiveness of farmers for investment and better development of skills tied to the results achieved.

Mr President, Commissioner, the new Cyprus Presidency – we wish you success in your work – ladies and gentlemen, what we have heard today has made it very clear that there is a vast gulf between the position of the Council, which considers the Schengen issue we are discussing today simply to be a legal issue, and, on the other hand, the clear and coherent position of the Commission, which suggests quickly returning to the codecision procedure. The Council deprived us of our say on 6 and 7 June and we are relying on the Council recalling its sense of joint responsibility in this particular case. Schengen is a product of civilisation, a real and, we would say, inalienable achievement: 40 000 km of land borders, almost 800 km of maritime borders, 25 countries involved and 400 million citizens. Citing the supposed problem of public safety is not enough to call into question something that remains an extremely valuable achievement. Schengen, like the single market, is among the few accomplishments of the European Union which we can now say is responsible for there being even partial European citizenship. What is needed is more cooperation, more cooperation in policing and judicial terms, responsibility and solidarity. Parliament wants an open and integrated Europe, where everyone fully plays their part and that is another challenge that we want to achieve with the decisive contribution of the Commission and with a Council that restores solidarity in its relations with Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that a report on the evolution of macro-regional strategies is extremely important because the frame of reference is certainly not just Africa, but all the continents that look out over this crucial area. It is an area that needs resources, infrastructure, partnership and cooperation, through an integration policy that must be developed further in light of what has happened in the area bordering on southern Europe – the so-called Arab Spring, with all the undeniably genuine freedom movements that have not always led to what we would have wished. Lasting stability is still required, however, and could be achieved through a partnership aimed more at young people. Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes with a Euro-Mediterranean focus will provide those areas with a further opportunity for growth and enable many young people to develop work there.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at such a complicated time of spending rationalisation, restraints and restructuring of expenditure, defining a reasonable balanced budget, as our rapporteur Mr La Via has done, is a clear sign of how we can do well even in a context of great difficulty. That said, as the LIBE Committee, we take note of the information that, once received from the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), was then tangibly transposed into positive assessments. I am referring to Frontex, as well as to the question of the Refugee Fund. However, when it comes to the safety of citizens, we believe that in 2013, the bridge year for the next financial perspective, something more tangible needs to be done. I refer, in particular, to that list of political priorities which, Madam President, leaves no reasonable doubt as to the efficacy of the fight against organised crime. In this area, more can probably be done, and we are confident that the same indication can later be drawn up by the Committee on Budgets. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 – (IT) 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of this document, as well as the other document with which it forms the ‘two-pack’, because I believe that they could be important in creating both stability and growth. However, these alone are not enough. In any case, we believe that at a time of serious crisis such as that which the European Union is facing, Parliament should take on an even more courageous role than it has so far, and we believe that development, employment and the labour market go hand in hand with a mechanism for surveillance of the budgetary policy of each Member State, because discipline is extremely important. The European debt redemption fund could prove to be a useful tool, as could the annual coordinated public debt issuance framework. The European Investment Bank has a greater role in order to achieve budgetary, political and fiscal union, which are the essential objectives for growth and development, the need for which we are fully feeling and noticing at the moment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the future of European company law will undoubtedly determine the future of the European Union itself. One need think only of the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a sector that has gradually grown stronger but that now, more than ever, needs structural reform. The single European market will surely profit from the perspectives of a European company law with a vision. Clearly, this vision must be imparted by the Commission, and it seems to me that the Commissioner’s comments are heading in this direction. We need an action plan with clear, accessible rules, where reducing red tape is given a high profile, and where company law is there to serve SMEs and business in general. At the same time, we also need to look at other important issues, in particular, data protection, which must be updated and continually monitored and which could add to the burden on business. We need action for SMEs, extra safeguards for businesses to guarantee their rights, and cross-border mobility for companies, which must also be guaranteed and supported through an overarching approach aimed at meeting the requirements of company law, SMEs, healthy enterprise and, indeed, the employment market. We therefore trust that Mr Barnier’s proposals will bring company law in step with the times. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Madam President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that this appointment is an extremely important event or that the European Union should look after the weak and the vulnerable if it wishes to be even more real, authoritative and charismatic. There can be no doubt that choosing a Special Representative for Human Rights is an extremely valuable thing to do. My congratulations of course go to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on the outstanding work he has done. Solidarity, accountability and cooperation: the Member States that put these qualities into practice need to be consistently supported, and we also need to impose conditions favouring those third countries that show particular interest in, and pay attention to, the protection of fundamental rights. That is with regard to trade relations. On the subject of immigration, we still have a number of unresolved issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights for people who flee their native countries because they can see their interests and needs being trampled on there. We need to treat these people with great respect as well. It is a question of natural rights, rights that are inherent to the individual and closely linked to the growth of his or her personality. The European Union must therefore ensure that this role is fulfilled as effectively as possible. The person who is chosen must have two qualities: charisma and courage, and must believe wholeheartedly in the job he or she is appointed to do. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that at this time of great difficulty, with such an overwhelming financial and economic crisis, the Commissioner might feel there are other policy priorities to debate and discuss. Because otherwise, the issue of multilingualism, the issue of cultural wealth, the issue of democratic participation should already have been effectively resolved, but they have not. The European Union undoubtedly has union at a monetary level, while it does not yet at a fiscal or political level, and there is no doubt that the denial of rights of citizenship includes denial of the right to participation and information. What should consultation be for, if not to provide a procedure, a tool to help citizens understand what is happening and, through the occasional heated exchange of ideas, through proper debate, to come up with concrete proposals for the decisions that will then be taken by the European institutions? Standing between the goal and the procedures that have been identified, there is probably a strong political will on the part of the Commission. Yet there are a number of innovative opportunities, including websites, there are a number of tangible opportunities that could ensure that the cultural wealth – which should be encouraged – has a tangible opportunity for growth. Otherwise, there will not be much point in further extending the boundaries of the European Union, and it will not be possible to guarantee the social cohesion that is created through an open challenge towards the territory. It is true, we must combine the instrument of political consultations with the effectiveness of parliamentary activities in the best possible way, and we still need to make optimum use of resources in a context where they need to be used rationally. Nevertheless, Madam President, if Parliament really wishes to be the home for all EU citizens, much more needs to be done and we call upon the Commission to make a great effort in this direction.

Mr President, I take note of the speeches by Mr Gerbrandy, whom I congratulate, and the Commissioner. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I can only welcome the inclusion in the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of many of the suggestions made in our report from the Committee on International Trade. There is no doubt that, in the context of the EU’s external dimension, trade in environmental goods and services is an instrument of particular significance for economic and social development. In particular, the opening up of the markets to highly energy-efficient goods and services plays a role in Europe’s conscientious growth in terms of exports, the creation of new jobs related to the spread of new green technologies, and innovation and competitiveness for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. In our opinion, we have reaffirmed the importance of some essential elements in future European bilateral, multilateral and regional agreements: the reduction or removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade in environmental goods and services; the inclusion of a section on sustainability; the inclusion of tariff preferences for environmental goods and services produced within the Generalised System of Preferences; not to mention the simplification of procedures. The European Union must maintain its global leadership in protecting the environment and promoting, through trade, the use of green goods, services and technologies in third countries for truly sustainable global growth. We must, Commissioner, particularly in relation to third countries, encourage the conclusion of trade agreements consistent with the proposed energy efficiency measures, thus ensuring deliberate, smart growth within the European Union.

OECD data on youth unemployment in the EU, which stands at around 22%, contrast with the provisions of Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets out a number of actions at European level regarding young people, their education, employment and vocational training. Initiatives for growth, in this sense, are fundamental factors in the coordinated and harmonious development of the EU single market. Intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth are three main objectives for developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation and, at the same time, fostering a high-employment economy delivering social and territorial cohesion. These objectives are pursuable only through effective and efficient use of EU funds, in particular, the Structural Funds, of which EUR 82 billion remains unspent, much of which could be aimed at young people, in particular through small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby contributing to the creation of employment opportunities. I am therefore in favour of a future policy providing opportunities for young people by identifying further and more ambitious funding sources to help them to cope with high youth unemployment. I also consider it essential to allocate significant resources when drawing up the 2014-2020 financial framework, focusing on young people who are not in employment, education or training. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, the European Union’s internal security strategies are undoubtedly a fundamental reference point for protecting citizens. It is equally clear, however, that if this section is not allocated sufficient resources to enable these important objectives to be enacted, then security will remain – as it has thus far – a possible but somewhat indefinite option. Recent events show that security must be guaranteed not only through significant resource allocations but also through strong cooperation based on trust between Member States. The fight against organised crime and terrorism requires strong solidarity between Member States, safeguards for the licit economy, and robust law enforcement against all transnational threats. This demands a prevention-based approach, including border protection and effective enforcement measures to combat organised crime, mafias and terrorism. It is a challenge which, together, we can win. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, I have supported the de Jong report because it takes account, above all, of a valuable principle: that of the specific character and history of each nation and thus the substantive criminal law of each Member State. It is also concerned with protecting fundamental rights, respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and – in a European Union intent on dealing a real and fatal blow to organised crime, terrorism and corruption – allowing the judicial rulings issued by one Member State to be recognised in the others. In addition, it talks about the goal of harmonisation, with all the premises stated thus far, the definition of offences common to Member States and those guarantees for accused persons, especially under cross-examination, that may become the symbol of a common criminal law in the EU.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction plays a crucial role in respect of a priority which should perhaps be supported more strongly and incisively by the European Parliament, and that is the battle against drugs and drug addiction, at a time when addiction is not limited to drugs and psychotropic substances, because there are other addictions that should and could be better tackled through a list of actions that the European Union should support. To go back to the assessment, we found that the financial management was properly carried out, and we believe that in the financial perspectives for 2014-2020, more resources should be allocated to a context in which adolescence is often subject to serious attack. Information sharing on the web is important, as are Facebook and the Internet, but these, too, can sometimes lead to specific types of addiction. The monitoring centre could propose improvements for supporting multilingualism and we believe that it can improve its work, which is extremely positive, still further by introducing flexible measures in organisational terms. Stronger ties, which, in actual fact, already exist, with other agencies and with the Member States would allow us to confirm that the prospects for growth in this delicate area exist, based on a principle and value which is that of an overall strategy on addiction, and therefore not just on addiction to drugs.

on behalf of the PPE Group.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight months have now elapsed since we went to Lampedusa, in Sicily, to note and observe at first-hand what had happened during a year of increasing migration flows. However, the tragedies that have taken place in this period have not come to an end one little bit; quite the contrary. Even now, and already since April, other tragedies are being played out: 10 refugees have died en route
, which is a worrying sign from which we can clearly deduce that not everything that might have been done up till now has been done. We have a priority, which is to ensure that this House and the European institutions are seriously committed to three values – solidarity, responsibility and also courage. The Council, no less than the Commission, should probably have been much more courageous. To begin with, this is the case in the negotiations that must deliver more resources in the 2013 budget and the new 2014-2020 financial framework precisely for the protection and security of the EU’s territory, and in the meantime, in cooperation with third countries, remembering the good work done by Frontex, which can and must be improved. There are priorities that cannot be asked of others: bilateral agreements with border countries cannot be put in place by individual Member States. We should like to know what stage the agreement with Libya has reached and whether progress has been made with Tunisia and Egypt. What is more, when it comes to readmission, we need to ensure that readmission, wherever possible, can take place in the territory of origin. The Mediterranean is a thousand-year-old area where the bonds of peace have always existed between the countries on its shores. Now more than ever, however, we have a prospect in which individual Member States cannot cope with an emergency that is European. It is Europe that must take on the burden: strongly, enthusiastically, passionately, immediately and without delay. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE
),

 The tendency shown by the European Commission to focus attention on major hub airports is in complete contrast with the need for connection of areas such as islands and outermost regions, which need full accessibility and territorial integration due to their physical and natural characteristics. Equally, it is important for the European Commission to review Decision 2012/21/EU on the application of Article 106, in order to better understand the vital importance of the impact of these investments on territorial cohesion and social and economic development, especially in regions where other forms of transport are lacking. Furthermore, EU cofinancing by the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), cohesion and regional funds would allow regional airports to play a leading role in the creation of a wider European Common Aviation Area and therefore, during its review of the TEN-T, the Commission needs to recognise the vital link between regional air services and economic regeneration. I therefore remain convinced that future trans-European network policy must guarantee the mobility of people and goods and make regions, including peripheral regions, more attractive, as a practical contribution to revitalising investments and employment in the Single European Market. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, human trafficking is without doubt a heinous crime, but it is also a crime of transnational proportions. Eradicating it requires international cooperation between Member States and third countries, with a pre-eminent role for the EU institutions. We must overcome the exploitation inherent in prostitution, illegal labour and micro-criminality. However, talking about human trafficking without talking about organised crime would be to take a partial approach to such a worrying phenomenon, since human trafficking is very often controlled by organised crime. In the last few days we saw the establishment of the Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering (CRIM), of which I am the rapporteur. One of our guiding principles and political priorities will no doubt be to make the very most of our work so as to achieve greater collaboration and cooperation with third countries, because we think that regular and legal migration should be encouraged, while illegal migration should be countered strongly and – if we can manage it – eradicated. We therefore need bilateral agreements between the EU and individual third countries on regulating migratory flows, protecting basic freedoms through strong guarantees, and the involvement of Europol and Frontex in particular. All of which must be done in the pursuit of two principles – solidarity and responsibility – without which there is no way there will be any progress. That is also the overarching direction that we will be giving to the CRIM Committee, and the fact that a directive shortly to be transposed in all the Member States is an essential tool in the fight against human trafficking tells us just how much difference a strong European approach could make to this worrying and ongoing phenomenon.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes a year after another, essentially identical debate. One year ago Lampedusa was overrun, as was the case in Greece this year and in previous years. Mr Busuttil made the point not long ago: 60 000 people came to Lampedusa, but certainly had no intention of staying there. These migrants – economic migrants – arrive in Italy, Greece and Malta, not by any means to stay there but rather to move on to other EU Member States. The answer to this is more Europe, more responsibility, more solidarity and enterprise. Negotiations have been opened on the funds for this area of action over the 2014-2020 planning period and might I suggest that Ms Malmström steps in there, just as the Council is pushing for a more enterprising approach. There is no doubt that there are some obstreperous Member States. What we need to do is overcome this attitude, otherwise Europe will not make any progress in this regard. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE
),

 Education means using intelligent methods to give expression to each person’s intrinsic potential. Increasing education, training and research is a cornerstone of growth and modernisation in higher education. However, the success of tertiary education also depends on policies to improve the social inclusion of minorities, gender equality and cutting the number of school-leavers. On top of these goals, there is the aim of encouraging institutions to systematically integrate mobility for education purposes within their programmes. Suitable funding is, however, required in order to achieve this: currently it is just 1.3% of gross domestic product, compared with 2.7% in the USA. Language skills are, moreover, in high demand among businesses and good skills in this area improve job prospects. Also connected to this is the equally important subject of e
-learning: the fusion of education and computer literacy, which provides innovative ways for teaching new generations. Europe’s future strength in this area will depend on putting higher education at the heart of innovation, creating jobs and employable skills, and on the ability of higher education institutions to play a full role in the knowledge triangle: connecting teaching, research and business to boost excellence and regional development.

 I voted in favour because I firmly believe that Europe must support the winds of freedom blowing through the Mediterranean, with a strategic commitment to promoting democracy, by means of urgent, concrete help. In this regard, I believe that establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy could be one of the most tangible responses by the European Union to the challenges of democratisation in our neighbourhood. The Arab Spring showed Europe the great aspirations towards democracy of the Mediterranean populations, as well as the urgency of addressing the instability generated by undemocratic regimes in the EU’s neighbourhood. In particular, the events we have witnessed have been surprising for the role played by civil society and the power of popular protest. For this reason, I am very much in favour of the bottom-up approach that will guarantee direct support to civil society. However, this instrument will only be able to operate effectively if clear and transparent rules are adopted for the distribution of funds, inspired by an across-the-board involvement of civil society and pluralistic support for parties and associations.

 Free movement is one of the EU’s most cherished achievements, which is also confirmed by the fact that 88% of European citizens (interviewed) recognise it as the most familiar of the four freedoms introduced by the EU. The programmes relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with increased synergy with other EU programmes, can undoubtedly help to give new impetus to the concept of European citizenship and to dismantle the obstacles that are still restricting it. Accordingly, the proper functioning of the single market is based on dismantling the obstacles to economic and social cohesion in the EU, which can be achieved, as the Commission has reiterated, by updating Directive 2005/36/EC in order to allow for the swifter, less bureaucratic recognition of professional qualifications. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must represent an additional opportunity for Europe to dismantle the further obstacles that still prevent European citizens from fully enjoying their rights as European citizens, and help to build a single market at the service of citizens. Finally, it should be emphasised that while EU citizenship is often considered secondary to national citizenship, it can be used as a ‘preparatory citizenship’ for non-EU citizens who meet certain conditions, such as ‘good conduct’.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, though it may have taken a long time to reach an agreement, there is no doubt that this programme constitutes an instrument of great solidarity and for this reason its success must be warmly welcomed. We are of the opinion that joint resettlement is a great opportunity of redemption for many desperate people looking for protection, people who come from extremely difficult situations and who deserve a willingness on our part that is not just formal but tangible and substantive. There must be a responsible contribution from Member States, given that this is on a voluntary basis. Eurostat has in recent days announced the data: over 300,000 applications. I am pleased to note that the country that ranks first in accepting applications for humanitarian protection is Italy, a country which once again needs the constructive backing of the European Union because, as you will know, landings in Lampedusa have started again on a massive and significant scale. The Italian Government must do a lot, but this tangible backing from the European Union also needs to be there. We are of course opposed to illegal migratory flows, which must be firmly opposed because they are often in the hands of organised crime syndicates, and we are looking at a time period of 2013, and then at 2014-2020, in order to ensure that resettlement programmes may become a real and tangible goal. We would like to acknowledge the rapporteur, on the one hand, and Commissioner Malmström, on the other, for working so hard on this matter. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a joint motion for a resolution on a subject of particular importance – that of discrimination, of aversion to those who must in fact be integrated and welcomed where there is clearly a chance of work or reuniting a family – is undoubtedly helpful. European citizenship is a subject of extraordinary value. We certainly need to be conscious of it; we need to give new life to the theme of reception and integration; we need to bear in mind that there are directives – Directive 2004/38/EC, which is essential in this respect – and while we are working on celebrations for 2013, the designated European Year of Citizens, all this is why we need to remove every obstacle that hitherto has specifically caused these difficulties. In the meantime, the Internet, while it is a key means of knowledge, must definitely be linked to a series of essential requirements to which its users should adhere. Thank you.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important requirement and one that must be supported, just as we must support the advancement of the status of women, not only in the workplace. Important progress has been made in recent decades, including through absolutely cutting-edge EU legislation. Sixty per cent of our graduates are women but there is no doubt that accessing the world of work is tricky when women choose family life as well as work. The family needs to be safeguarded and protected, while the gender gap definitely has to be significantly reduced through well-defined social policies, greater working flexibility and, of course, by protecting vulnerable women. Let us remember that when it comes to trafficking in human beings, it is often women who are the victims, which is also an important subject to which yet further attention must be paid. Salvatore Iacolino,

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have listened carefully to the indications from the Commission about reinforcing judicial training. There is no doubt that this is a top priority, because we believe that the judicial training of magistrates and judicial practitioners serves not only to bring the various legal systems closer together – though they must remain distinct due to the typical characteristics of each – but certainly this mutual tangible cooperation can certainly facilitate what, today more than ever, is the transnational dimension of the law: lawyers, judicial practitioners, who must be supported by a common and consistent judicial training sector, possibly through exchanges via Erasmus, so as to set out an area of freedom, justice and security in which each component can make its own voice heard in a common European market in which competitiveness and sustainability are closely linked to a system of free movement of professions, in which it is important to have high quality assurance standards. For this reason, it is important to have a European professional card, a sort of European accreditation, in a context in which trust – as set out in the Stockholm Programme between the various Member States – should be based on a tangible mutual recognition of judicial orders, so that entry of young judicial practitioners onto the labour market can be facilitated and so that those who have the ability to use more than one language ​can be taken into account. There is still a role for the most important agencies in a context in which the financial perspectives of the 2014-2020 budget will have to be characterised not only by important and significant pilot projects, such as the one that has just been mentioned, but by appropriate and adequate resources so as to expand the number of people benefiting from this programme. Thank you. Salvatore Iacolino  (PPE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that family reunification is an issue of substance, one that is serious and concrete. The welfare of the family must take precedence over anything else, even if it is, of course, undeniable that this right must be subject to rules. In my opinion, the 2003 directive contains useful rules, though they must be applied uniformly and homogeneously within the territory of all Member States. For this reason, the Commission has quite rightly initiated a serious debate by publishing a Green Paper, in which it sets out a clear vision: to introduce concrete measures in support of a process of family reunification which, in my opinion, simply has to be taken into account. I am the rapporteur of a document on information and communications technology, on the transfer of workers who are third-country nationals to establishments located both in third countries and in Europe. In this particular case, a more favourable exception clause was carried in committee to ensure family reunification at a practical level, which is definitely a political priority for the European People’s Party. Of course, language is important, and we must ensure that the European agenda on migratory flows – again in this case we are speaking of legal immigration – takes account of this directive, which is absolutely correct and practical. The Commission’s goal must be to urge Member States to adopt rules that can and will be applied in practice and, at the same time, ensure that the right to be together is truly recognised, one to which no one can object. The PPE’s aim is to ensure that the 500 000 individuals who are potential beneficiaries of this rule are given due consideration by Member States. Susy De Martini  (ECR

 I voted in favour of this report for which I was shadow rapporteur for the ECR Group. However, I believe that it fails to adequately balance the importance of strong bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia and the EU with legitimate concerns over the Kingdom’s human rights record. Instead, the report is almost entirely dominated by the latter. In fact, the report does not adequately recognise progress made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in some aspects of human rights and equality, in particular with regard to the role of women. The report also does not properly consider the important role played by Saudi Arabia in counter-terrorism or EU-Saudi trade relations. I therefore feel that, while I am able to vote in favour of the report, I also consider it to be a missed opportunity to engage positively with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, stressing our existing relations with it as a key strategic partner in the region, proposing measures to strengthen EU-Saudi links, and also to work constructively with them to improve their human rights record.

Madam President, I must say to Baroness Ashton, as a physician and a human being, that I have a specific concern, namely about so-called ‘Cuban health diplomacy’. Cuba is sending out doctors under government-to-government cooperation agreements. This practice has now become Cuba’s biggest industry, bringing in USD 6 billion. In Venezuela alone, there are more than 30 000 Cuban doctors, traded for oil; in Brazil there are 6 000 of them. The host countries pay for each doctor about USD 5 000 per month, while the doctors themselves receive only USD 25. These bilateral agreements clearly violate a number of International Labour Organisation conventions. One of the escaped Cuban doctors recently stated, ‘We are the highest qualified slave labour force in the world.’ Are we sure that we should continue to finance Cuba, with EUR 30 million each year?

 Madam President, I am new here, and therefore I thank you twice for giving me the opportunity to speak for the first time. I will now switch to my other mother tongue, Italian. Signora Presidente, l'Iniziativa dei cittadini europei, particolarmente importante in questo momento di sfiducia nei confronti dell'Europa, sembra avere qualche problema di comunicazione e burocratico, com'è già stato rilevato dalla signora Commissario e da altri colleghi. Faccio un esempio pratico su tutti, che riguarda proprio il mio paese, l'Italia: l'Iniziativa sull'acqua pubblica ha raccolto, dopo nove mesi, poco più di 25.000 firme sulle 54.000 necessarie per l'Italia, mentre sullo stesso soggetto, a livello di referendum 
nazionale, erano state raccolte nel 2011, quindi poco fa, in pochi mesi più di un milione di firme. Questa discrepanza di successo fra l'iniziativa di un singolo Stato e quella europea non può essere spiegata se non con le esistenti difficoltà di comunicazione e di ordine burocratico. So che è stata presentata un'iniziativa per semplificare questo diritto d'iniziativa. Sembra un gioco di parole, ma è una realtà che mi fa venire in mente questa frase "Un cammello è l'esatta descrizione di un cavallo fatta da un burocrate". Spero proprio che la Commissione possa porre un veloce rimedio a quanto sta accadendo.
