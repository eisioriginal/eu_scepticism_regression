 Madam President, I join all my fellow Members in expressing my satisfaction at today’s debate and I would like to focus my speech on territorial cohesion. I would say that it is never too late to do the right thing, but nonetheless, a great deal of time has been lost in making territorial cohesion a key political objective for the European Union. There have of course been institutional problems, soon to be removed, I hope, as well as, if you will excuse me Mrs Hübner, the Commission’s extreme caution in this area. We should note, however, that throughout this whole parliamentary term, since 2004-2005, Parliament has constantly tried to get up steam, because we consider the principle of equality in the treatment of all EU citizens, wherever they live, to be extremely important, and believe it is vital that we move forward together. The Green Paper has arrived at last, and we are pleased. It suffers slightly from a lack of ambition, I feel: we would have liked the Commission to set out a definition and clear objectives rather than making very open remarks on the subject. We are nonetheless making progress even if, I believe, we will again be somewhat hampered by the disproportionate link made with the Lisbon Strategy, during implementation of the previous generation of Structural Funds. Consultation is now under way, and I hope it will come to the conclusion that we must increase resources, perfect our tools – these plans are for 2013 onwards: we have time, but it will soon fly by – strengthen financial means, develop cooperation at the different levels, have an integrated vision of development, in particular with regard to this issue of sectoral policies we are debating, and coordinate the common agricultural policy and regional development, and so on. We need the White Paper as soon as possible, Commissioner. To conclude, I would like to emphasise the urgency of promoting territorial cohesion in all the regions of Europe, because spatial equality is essential to ending the crisis and achieving economic recovery, and above all to encouraging our fellow citizens to participate in European projects.

 According to OECD figures, between now and 2020 we will produce 45% more waste than in 1995. Therefore, the European Union urgently needs to define a new waste management strategy allowing all types of waste to be seen not only as a source of pollution to be reduced, but also as a potential resource to be exploited. The compromise adopted at today’s plenary will help to shift the focus towards prevention and recycling – with the aim of stabilising the volume of waste produced between now and 2012 and meeting the recycling targets of 50% of household waste and 70% of construction and demolition waste by 2020 – with separate waste collection schemes being mandatory by 2015, at least for paper, metal, plastic and glass, and tighter regulations for hazardous waste, mainly through separate collection and traceability. Separate waste oil collection will also have to be arranged, as well as distinguishing between incineration operations aimed at the ultimate elimination of waste and those that recycle through energy recovery. Therefore, by applying an energy efficiency formula, only the most energy-efficient municipal waste incinerators will be classified as recycling plants.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are discussing two parliamentary initiative reports, but I feel both of them are extremely important for a number of reasons. Firstly, we are considering the Commission’s Fourth Report on Social and Economic Cohesion. This is a truly remarkable document, much better than the previous versions, and it constitutes a firm basis for all manner of reflections on the future of cohesion within Europe. It is also important because the brand new Lisbon Treaty establishes territorial cohesion as one of the EU’s main objectives. As we know, new and formidable challenges are now looming together with those we are already aware of, and cohesion policy must make a major worthwhile contribution to their consideration, to allow us to move forward to the Europe we want to see: that is, an effective, solidarity-conscious Europe. What does the Fourth Report show us? That social and economic convergence between the Member States is moving in the right direction, with a definite reduction in discrepancies in terms of income and jobs over the last decade, but also that there are still considerable disparities between regions, and occasionally within regions, with a frequent tendency to become more acute. Development is real enough, but is plagued by far too many imbalances. It is here that the new concept of territorial cohesion comes into its own, and this is where it must take centre stage in the continuation of regional development throughout the EU alongside economic and social cohesion. Implementing this will require an integrated approach among sectorial policies, and genuine multi-level governance. Here we await with interest, and I must say with some impatience, the Commission’s Green Paper in September. There is an obvious need for a common language on this issue, as emerged from our discussions in the Committee on Regional Development. The teachings of the Fourth Report project our thoughts to after 2013, since operational programmes for 2007-2013 are now in place at almost all locations. One of their main features is a credit earmarking system to channel the basic essentials of resources towards the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. While we wish to stress the close relationship of priorities between the Lisbon Strategy and cohesion policy, we feel the latter must forge beyond this sphere and take up a position within a broader perspective. Our report firmly states that convergence on different levels is a prior condition for long-term competitiveness in the regions, and that in years to come complementarity of the two policies will be necessary to reconcile effectiveness and solidarity. Periodic assessment over the 2007-2013 period, which we are calling for, must allow us to confirm the appropriateness of the process, or to implement any adjustments that may be necessary in a properly informed fashion. Questions must also be asked as to the dissociation implemented over the current scheduling period between rural development and regional policy. Its relevance does not appear to be well established on the ground, and we feel that maintaining this separation after 2013 may pose a problem. Our report emphasises the new challenges to be faced by the EU and their substantial territorial impact. There are problems such as population ageing, climate change, energy, urban concentration etc. We feel that necessary and urgent convergence and an appropriate territorial approach for these challenges call for enhanced political and financial cohesion policies after 2013. In this perspective, Parliament will staunchly oppose, as it has always done, any attempt to renationalise the policy. I wish to finish, Madam President, by thanking the shadow rapporteurs, who were of great assistance to me in this task, for the large number of compromises we were able to achieve. I also wish to emphasise coherence with Mrs Kallenbach’s report. I think it would be good if a fully coherent whole were presented in the House today.

Mr President, I will be brief. First of all, in relation to the observations made on the amendments submitted by the Committee on Fisheries, I must say immediately that fishing is an issue dear to my heart as a coastal MEP, but unfortunately we did not manage to add the committee’s amendments to the text that is about to be put to the vote. We regret this, but I feel it does not mean any less attention ought to be paid to a sector so important to certain EU regions. I would also like to say that cohesion is a major European policy. I also think it was portrayed as a major theme in the House this morning. This is an important point, particularly in relation to future tasks. The Commissioner said earlier that we are dealing with a report, but obviously it is the future that interests us. She realises expectations are running high with regard to territorial cohesion, and what this represents once it is taken up in the Lisbon Treaty. We might say that the ball is now in the Commission’s court with, of course, our assistance and support, Commissioner. The job must be done, and it must be done well, on a joint basis. I wish to add that the fact that regional policy as a whole will now be a matter for codecision by the Council and Parliament will help us move forward together, to make this clearer for our fellow citizens, also a point I feel was solidly made this morning, and also to implement genuine solidarity to the benefit of regions which need it most. Both these concerns were pointed out most firmly this morning. A huge task therefore awaits us. We welcome a policy that is essential to the European Union.

The PPE-DE Group’s French delegation welcomes the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012. Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency’s activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully. The French delegation, following the group line, rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma. It did so not in order to express their opposition to this legitimate and justifiable goal, but because these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency’s thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities. We welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens.

Mr President, this is an important, complex and tricky subject that we are debating today. Combating the pests that devour and damage crops is a necessary challenge in terms of both food security and the protection and improvement of our environment. Sensible recourse to pesticides is therefore unavoidable. It is essential, however, that the associated risks should be assessed in a balanced way, particularly with regard to human health, and that measures to scale down pesticide use should be properly planned. The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is, in my view, a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face, and I should like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Irena Belohorská, and to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that went into the drafting of the text. Certain comments are called for: the core problem of risk management is inseparable from the question of how much pesticide is used. The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle. In respect of other pesticides, we have to apply subsidiarity. Working within a common European framework, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to set their own national targets, timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used. National action plans will also facilitate adaptation to particular circumstances in each country. It is extremely important, too, to protect the aquatic environment and we must be rigorous here by establishing buffer zones fixed in accordance with local conditions. Finally, I would point out that the system we wish to implement is a logical follow-on to the REACH directive. With regard to pesticide quantities, the thrust of our argument should be ‘as little as possible and as much as necessary’.

Organic farming now represents 1.4% of the agricultural production of the 25 Member States and 3.6% of the utilised agricultural area (1.8% of the agricultural land in Brittany). Consumer demand continues to increase, and the arrival on the market of these products, which have all manner of labels and which are produced even outside the EU, presents new problems where control, certification and labelling are concerned. Furthermore, the subsidies and standards in this area are very disparate from one country to the next, and this creates distortions of competition for those organic producers who receive the least assistance. I therefore welcome the adoption in plenary of the opinion of the European Parliament addressed to the Council calling on it swiftly to adopt the regulation on organic farming. This new regulation must make it possible to clarify the Community framework relating to organic food production, which dates back to 1991. Parliament requests that the national inspection systems be strengthened so that products can be traced at every stage of production. If it is compulsory to use the European logo (for foodstuffs containing 95% organic ingredients) and the ‘EU-organic’ indication, then it must remain possible to add other private logos. Finally, the use of GMOs must be prohibited in organic farming.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like first of all to pay tribute to the very high quality of the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Pleguezuelos Aguilar. I should also like to say what a pleasure it was for us to work together on drafting this report. I believe that the rapporteur has covered all the main points, as has Mrs Griesbeck, with whose remarks I wholeheartedly agree. I should like, however, simply to draw your attention to four points. Firstly, we need to evaluate the situation properly and, to that end, indicators, which have just been mentioned, seem crucial. At the moment, we only have GDP, which is really not enough. Secondly, we also need to integrate properly the new territorial challenges that we are going to, and that we already, face. I am thinking about the ageing of the population, energy, climate change and also agricultural policy, which unquestionably influences cohesion policy. Thirdly, the EU structural policies will very soon represent the first EU budget. That is why an integrated approach not only with the other EU policies, but also with those practised in each of the Member States, is extremely important. As for the fourth point, Commissioner, I believe that we need to discuss it seriously: it concerns the structural policy and the Lisbon Strategy. Of course, the structural policy must contribute to the practical expression and success of the Lisbon Strategy, but let us be careful to ensure the balanced development of the territories. It seems entirely obvious to me that, in itself, the Lisbon Strategy does not make for balance: I believe that we must be very mindful of that. Very soon we will have a further opportunity to speak about this matter: when Parliament receives the fourth report on cohesion and when we carry out our work on this subject with the aim of knowing how to develop this policy in the future.

Territorial cohesion in Europe aimed at reducing inter- and infra-regional disparities is a major objective of the European Union. I welcome the adoption of this report today. It raises the issue of the European Union’s absorption capacity and specifies, in particular, that, given the current state of the Union’s own resources system, any further enlargements could not be funded without the effectiveness of the current cohesion policies being harmed. From this perspective, regional expenditure needs to be rationalised. An institutional, financial and political reform is desirable as part of a revision of the Community financial framework. Furthermore, it is impossible to have an honest and effective cohesion policy without the European Union’s budget being increased.

Mr President, no doubt like all of our fellow Members here, in this House, I feel that we need a clear European framework in order to overcome the major challenge of responsible waste management. I also believe that we all share the view that the new European strategy on waste must show that waste, in all its guises, is not only a source of pollution to be reduced, but also a potential resource to be exploited. That is why I have no hesitation in supporting the process under way, and I welcome the remarkable work that has been done by our rapporteur in terms of modernising the laws that have been amassed for 30 years on this subject. It is therefore crucial, as many Members have also pointed out, to clearly re-establish the five-stage hierarchy in descending order of priority: prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and disposal. This should be done by maintaining a minimum level of flexibility, with account taken, in particular, of the economic aspects that affect the sectors. It has also become apparent what the cost might be of seeking exemptions from these kinds of constraints, which are imperative. I should like to reiterate that I fully support the amendments aimed at consolidating the definitions, not least those on the end-of-life of waste, on producer responsibility and on prevention. Finally, I believe that it is important, as many of our fellow Members have also pointed out, to enhance the legislation on hazardous waste, not least by imposing the requirement for this waste to be collected separately and for there to be a reliable way of tracing it.

It is very important for the European Union to have a harmonised system for registering, authorising and controlling chemical substances. One Member State on its own cannot establish an effective system. This system must make it possible, on the one hand, to reduce the risks to our health and our environment, and, on the other hand, to promote innovation and support for economic activities that are non-polluting. The compromise voted on today successfully rises to the challenge of an ambitious piece of legislation, the principal aim of which is to create an effective system for protecting individuals, without hindering economic development.

With a maximum sum of EUR 500 million granted to it each year, this European Fund is intended to soften the blow of globalisation for employees affected by restructuring. This is not a new form of aid for businesses, but extra assistance aimed at helping to find new jobs for employees who have been made redundant following changes in world trade. The fund will be introduced on three conditions: there have been at least 1 000 redundancies; they have had a serious impact on employment and the local economy; and they are linked to a disruption in world trade. The fund can therefore only be used in the event of ‘major changes in the structure of world trade leading to a serious economic disruption’, such as a huge rise in imports, a gradual decline in the EU’s market share in a sector, or a company relocating to a third country. I welcome the adoption of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which will enable Europeans to gain a response to their worries concerning the negative effects of globalisation and will help establish more economic and social cohesion within the European Union.

The Services Directive has just been adopted, by a clear majority. This is to the European Parliament’s credit. This is a victory for the European Union. Why? Services represent over half of the European economy, and are the main source of jobs. The free provision of services features among the founding principles of the Union, and the creation of a genuine internal market in services is key to economic growth in Europe, and thus to the creation of jobs. The text adopted today in Strasbourg commits us to this path, while providing the necessary guarantees regarding the safeguarding of public services of general interest and the continuity of our social acquis 
and of our labour law. By excluding the country of origin principle, it prohibits social competition and constitutes an effective barrier to social dumping. It does away with the unjustified protectionist obstacles, while permitting the Member States to apply their national rules when the public interest warrants it. The scope of the text has also been reduced, with the exclusion of sensitive sectors such as the audiovisual sector, the health sector, part of the social services sector, the gambling sector and even the notary sector. This is a good compromise, which will take Europe forward in line with the interests of its population.

 I welcome the adoption at first reading of Mrs Lienemann’s report on the ‘Marine Strategy Directive’, an essential document that is in line with the Framework Water Directive (FWD). However, I would like to say that I am not convinced of the feasibility of the timescale that has just been adopted. Indeed, we do not yet have sufficient knowledge of the marine environment in order to reach a true assessment of the environmental situation of European seas within the shortened period. As we are witnessing with the implementation of the FWD, the preparation and analysis phase is always difficult and longer than anticipated. Moreover, the marine environment is by no means characterised by rapid change. I therefore feel that the timetable proposed by the Commission is already sufficiently ambitious.

Mr President, Commissioner, we are hardly in any doubt as to the outcome of tomorrow’s vote on the strategic guidelines, which will probably gain the support of virtually all of our Assembly; I, like many others in this House, believe that the work of our rapporteur has got something to do with that. It is, however, as everyone knows, quite late in the day to be talking about this, here and now. The drafting of the operational programmes is already well under way in most countries. Obviously, it is the result that interests us. What will the Union’s regional policy, which represents almost 40% of the Community budget, really be of use to: the Lisbon Strategy, territorial cohesion, or indeed both? We hope that it will be of use to both. It seems to me, at any rate, that the principle on which Parliament was not consulted – earmarking, which mainly concerns the old Member States – is one of the most technocratic and, in my modest opinion, undoubtedly one of the least intelligent ever thought up in Europe. It is the combination of two technocracies, that of the Commission, whose skill in this area is renowned, and that of the Member States, which is as varied as it is developed. What will come of this? We can still hope for the best. To do so, we shall have to wait for the Commission to examine the operational programmes submitted by the Member States, a process that will take months. I hope that these programmes will respond first and foremost to the needs and to the will of the urban populations, and of the rural populations, to which they apply. We know that you are paying attention, Commissioner, to these well-founded concerns. Let us hope that you can convince your interlocutors and colleagues of this.

 Mr President, in the words of the President of this House, this debate may be prosaic, but it is important, because what we are discussing is more than 35% of the EU's budget, and I think it would have been worthwhile to devote the whole morning to such a subject. That would also have avoided the situation that some Members find themselves in, of having just one minute to deal with a mission impossible. I myself have two minutes, and I am grateful to those who allowed me this time. Regional policy is vital for the new Member States, as we know. It is also important for the others, but it is now the implementation that counts, as our general rapporteur Mr Hadzidakis, and the Commissioner, said just now. This implementation must, of course, take place, but it need not necessarily be uniform: the regional priorities must be as variable as the barriers to development. We all subscribe to the Lisbon Strategy, but the means to make it successful – which it has not yet been – can certainly not be uniform over the whole territory. That is true for all the Member States, not just the newest ones: accessibility for the peripheral regions and the enclaves continues to be a prerequisite for competitiveness and, therefore, for enabling us to get them to meet the EU's general objectives. That is why a strict application of the earmarking of appropriations, with the associated risk of exacerbating still further the disparities between and within regions, would, in my view, be a mistake. It is vital for regional policy to be visible to and popular with our fellow citizens, in order to avoid further disappointments when they are asked about the future of the Union: in simple terms, we need them to feel involved in the progress of regional development. In this regard, we still have much to do.

 Mr President, like all my fellow Members who spoke before me, I would pay tribute to the quality of the work done by Mrs Krehl, and I should like to join with her in emphasising the major importance of the objective of territorial cohesion, which I think is crucial to the future of our European Union. In my view, this is not made clear enough in the Commission’s proposal. What is more, the earmarking of appropriations under the Lisbon Strategy, which has been introduced surreptitiously by means of an annex to the Structural Funds General Regulation, is in danger of further exacerbating inter-regional or sub-regional disparities which, I believe, have in no small measure contributed to the constitutional deadlock in which we at present find ourselves. That would, moreover, particularly be the case in countries and regions in which a premium is placed on the objectives of competitiveness and employment. Indeed, the obstacles to development vary, and are different, according to the geographical situation of the regions. In particular, I should like to emphasise that accessibility remains an indispensable prior condition of the more or less peripheral or isolated regions becoming competitive and, therefore, of their perhaps subscribing to the Lisbon Strategy. Earmarking, under the terms of the annex I mentioned, would, if applied rigidly, hamper these regions by preventing them, in particular, from funding vital transport infrastructure. What is more, we are talking here about highly technocratic arrangements which, I believe, would make the EU’s regional policy still less transparent and still more incomprehensible to our fellow citizens. Is that really what we want? Obviously not. That is why, Commissioner, it is important for it to be clearly confirmed to us that there will be acceptance of the necessary flexibility, both in the National Strategic Reference Frameworks and in the regional operational programmes. Having discussed the matter a little with Mrs Hübner, I got the impression that she was alert to this issue, but, really, I should like the Commission to take due account of it.

Mr President, the phenomenon of relocation worries the European Union as a whole but, more specifically, the old Member States. Moreover, we know the reasons why, as they have been pointed out by our fellow Members: economic globalisation, distortions of competition both in social and in fiscal terms and so on. It is clear that this issue has had an unquestionable influence on the recent constitutional debate, and we, in our country – France – are aware of the consequences. This report is therefore very timely, and I, for my part, should like to pay tribute to the work done by our rapporteur, as well as to the improvements made by the Committee on Regional Development. We now have a balanced text. It can genuinely enhance the measures designed to combat relocations and to prevent the negative effects that they may have. I, for my part, should like to emphasise a particular point, and we are clearly talking here about regional development: the report stresses the importance of properly using the Structural Funds in order to prevent the risk of short-, medium- and long-term relocations. We are mainly concerned here with the aid granted directly to those economic sectors in need of support, but it is clear that one crucial factor in danger of inducing companies to relocate has to do with the isolated location and poor accessibility of production units. It is therefore important that the new generation of Structural Funds allocated to competitiveness and employment gives priority to, among other areas, improving the accessibility of regions that are at a significant disadvantage in this regard. This would be the best way of ensuring that economic activities continue in these regions. I, for my part, hope that, in addition to considering the requests and recommendations contained in the report, the Commission will also welcome this specific appeal, which will most certainly be forthcoming when the new regional development programmes are drafted.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in common with all Members of this House, I agree on the objectives of the new rural development funds and on the need to strengthen the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. I should like to add my voice to the congratulations offered to the rapporteur and welcome the input from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I am particularly grateful to Mrs Attwooll for helping to clarify a text that strikes me as decidedly overladen and not always easy to understand, not least by those who will have to implement it on the ground. The experience of the ongoing Leader programmes is a salutary lesson in the dangers of an excessively fussy, nit-picking set of guidelines. I personally wanted to emphasise the need to take territorial cohesion into account. In order for this to become a reality, a balance must be struck between territories in line with the principle of equality among all citizens of the EU no matter where they live. Rural areas must not be defined in terms of the difference between them and urban areas. On the contrary, the relationship between the urban and rural environments needs to be strengthened by developing, inter alia
, public services and in particular complementarity and transport accessibility. The quality of life required to sustain an active population in the rural sectors entails cooperation and the joint implementation of essential financial resources. Lastly, new territorial indicators are required to improve the process of evaluating and deciding upon measures to strengthen territorial cohesion. In addition to gross domestic product, there is also a need to include employment rates, the decentralisation index and the level of public-service provision. We await the Commission’s proposals in this regard, and not solely from you, Commissioner.

Mr President, animal welfare is undoubtedly a noble cause; we subscribe to it and we also pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Berman. I will simply add that the farmers’ welfare is also a noble cause and, in our view, a high-priority cause. This sector is already seriously threatened by non-European competition. I heard one of my fellow Members say a short while ago that there had been no farm closures, but that is incorrect because this is already a widespread phenomenon across the European territory. I will simply mention my own region – Brittany – which represents 35% of the French production of broiler chickens and which, above all, accounts for 18 000 jobs, 11 000 of which are in the agricultural and food industries. This is a region in which farms are currently being closed. Clearly, if the current – and already very serious – distortions of competition increase, then we will witness a massive influx of products from third countries, coupled with a fall in our exports. Of course, it is all very well being told ‘produce high-quality goods’, but we know that adapting and restructuring are very risky, and in any case require a great deal of time. A great deal of work has been done on this matter, but there are nevertheless some real shortcomings in the justifications of this text. I will mention the thresholds, which seem to give rise to a virtue contest, with the thresholds being set at the lowest levels possible; next, the assessment indicators of the ‘breeding contests’; and lastly, and above all, the impact study of the repercussions in terms of the elimination of farms and jobs in the sector. To conclude, I should like to pose a question to Commissioner Kiprianou. Commissioner, in the current context of the threat of avian influenza, which is approaching Europe, or even already in Europe, how should one go about tackling the paradox between, on the one hand, high European standards in respect of animal welfare and, on the other, the necessary national measures for keeping poultry indoors? We should be grateful to receive your reply.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to spend a few minutes presenting my report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development. It is worth pointing out that there have been repeated and insistent calls from a large number of European regions over many years for this concept to be taken into account in EU policies. The accession of 10 new Member States, which has manifested itself in a worsening of regional disparities and the emergence of new territorial inequalities, has singularly amplified the calls for this major necessity. The draftsmen of the draft Constitution for Europe were well aware of this, since Article 3 of the draft Treaty refers to economic, social and territorial cohesion among the essential objectives of the EU. The problematic fate of the Treaty could lead some of those responsible for regional policy, particularly within the European Commission, to show extreme caution against even referring to the necessity for territorial cohesion. We do not consider this attitude to be justified and I hope, Commissioner, that you will share our viewpoint. Indeed, the tremendous geographical, human and cultural diversity of the territory of the EU, within what is, when all is said and done, a relatively limited area, represents a unique asset on this planet, but, if we are not careful, it contains the seeds for major imbalances that are unbearable for those who view themselves as the victims. This was demonstrated beyond all our fears, unfortunately, during the referenda in France and the Netherlands on the draft European Constitution. It is probable that popular referenda organised on the same basis would have produced the same result in several other Member States. That is why I wanted my report to contribute to finding answers to the questions raised. How can we reconcile the citizens to the European project? What is the future for Europe? For our Europe. One of the answers is provided by the cohesion policy, this policy of solidarity that is the original model for the EU and that sets it apart from a simple free-trade area. Besides ensuring that it has the necessary resources, which assumes that it will be taken properly into account in the financial perspective 2007-2013, it is important for it to integrate the territorial dimension into all its aspects. That is how territorial cohesion will come to represent a clear basis that all Europeans can understand for increasing cohesion within the territory of the EU. More particularly in relation to the realisation of territorial cohesion, I will mention a few specific principles and measures. The principles are as follows: the principle of equality between citizens throughout the territory, which in particular implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest; integration of the territorial aspect into the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; multicentric development of the European territory; the role of small and medium-sized towns and their connection with rural areas; strengthening all aspects of territorial cooperation; supported decentralisation to the regions, which are best acquainted with the needs and potential of their territories; multilevel governance, and the participation of non-public partners. One of the concrete proposals that we are presenting to the Commission relates to the implementation of three instruments. First of all, we are proposing a mechanism for cross-fertilisation between sector-specific policies with a major impact on the development of the EU’s territories and regional development policy. Next, new territorial indicators, in addition to gross domestic product, are needed to measure the development of a region and to assess objectively the obstacles to this development. Finally, we need a system for assessing the impact that various Community policies have on territorial cohesion. Another proposal relates to the drafting of a White Paper on the objective of territorial cohesion and in particular on how this objective is to be incorporated into the national strategic plans that the Member States are currently in the process of drawing up. I hope, for my part, that tomorrow’s vote will translate Parliament’s broad support into an ambitious territorial cohesion policy.

Mr President, the Commission’s Communication on the financing of Natura 2000 lists various possibilities for dealing with the needs that will arise during the 2007-2013 period. It concludes, as the Commissioner pointed out, that the creation of a new financial instrument is not the appropriate formula. I completely agree with this point of view, even though it has not been expressed a great deal here this afternoon. The Natura 2000 areas proposed by the Member States are eligible as priorities, in the majority of cases, for the Cohesion and Structural Funds, and could be priorities for benefiting from Life funds for the costs of managing and monitoring the programmes. Why, therefore, should we want to distinguish the funding of Natura 2000 programmes from the funding of regional or rural policies? The actions in both cases are very much linked, whether the objectives are related to local development, protecting environments or maintaining biodiversity. There would be a huge risk that Natura 2000 would become completely disconnected from everything that was done elsewhere in the areas concerned. The obstacles encountered during the long – or even very long – period of defining the Natura 2000 areas would be multiplied, and the isolation of this mechanism, which is supposed to be exemplary, would be even greater. The other risk would be that it would be excessively complex to implement and manage programmes. This would result in an increase in operational costs and create the impression of a monumental technocracy that would be rejected by the populations concerned. Finally, it should be pointed out that the forecast costs of the programmes are very variable depending on the country and the Natura 2000 areas chosen. Intelligent use of the Structural Funds, to which additional funds under Life could possibly be added, would, in my view, enable us to respond to them much better than with a specific financial instrument.

 Mr President, the rise in fuel prices affects many sectors of the European economy, and in particular transport-related sectors. Yet it is clear that the primary production sectors, such as agriculture and fisheries, are facing the most acute problems. This illustrates the unsatisfactory nature of our debate, in which we have bitten off more than we can chew. We should therefore focus on these two subjects. It is the fisheries sector which faces the most serious difficulties, and there are one or two extremely simple reasons for this. Within a little over one year, fishermen have seen the price of diesel oil double, with approximately one litre of fuel needed to catch one kilo of fish. This is why, together with the other Members of this House, I was quite literally shocked and appalled at the statements made by the Commissioner for Fisheries, in which he said that one need only pass the rise in the price of fuel on to the price of fish in order to solve the problems. This is of course impossible, and it is an example of the very kind of flawed reasoning which will dissuade consumers from buying fish, the very food we wish to promote. In my opinion, one of the lessons learnt from the crisis of 1993-1994, which caused a widespread breakdown of structures, was that extremely rapid action will be needed. The proposals we have just heard, in particular those put forward by Mrs Fraga and by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Morillon, include placing a ceiling on the cost of diesel oil, reducing financial, social and tax costs and, most importantly, providing monetary advances which correspond to the needs of fishermen experiencing very serious problems, of whom there are already a large number. This is why we look to the Commission to adopt a position which is both easily understood and which is designed to prevent the breakdown of structures in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing. In other words, there is a need for both measures taken at European level during crisis periods and national measures adapted to local situations.

Madam President, I would like first to thank Mrs Reding, our Commissioner, the French Presidency, which in December came to a very intelligent common position, and then the Czech Presidency, which has just achieved its aim. I would also like to thank and congratulate above all our three rapporteurs, Mr Harbour, Mrs Trautmann and Mrs del Castillo Vera, who have done a magnificent job. The package that we are voting on today includes provisions that go absolutely in the direction one would wish for the development of the telecommunications market, in an orderly fashion and for the benefit of everybody: a European regulation entrusted to a Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) with mixed financing, without a veto; a balance between competition and the need for new investment – functional separation is limited to exceptional cases; a desire to focus attention on public services in spectrum management; new services; new freedom of access; and, thanks to Mr Harbour in particular, a considerable increase in the rights of consumers. I am just sorry that ‘must carry’ has been rejected. For France, this text is perfectly balanced, it is a good compromise, and here I mean that, with regard to those infamous controversial amendments, what has been proposed in the end is intelligent, in my opinion, because it makes it possible to implement intellectual property rights on the Internet without compromising freedom of access to the latter. The Internet must apply the law in this field as in others. The virtual world is not a lawless world and it must not submit only to the power of advertising brought in by operators and Internet access providers. That is why I share Mrs Trautmann’s point of view. The compromise puts the rights of employees, of artists and of Internet users on an equal footing, and that is a good thing.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would refer to the working document of Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Wallis. For the benefit of the next Parliament, it asks the questions raised by this proposal for maximum harmonisation and highlights the risk that some countries perceive of a weakening in the protection of their own consumers. On the other hand, the Commission is right to want to expand cross-border trade, which is abnormally low for an internal market. I will not therefore go over the background again – as Mrs McCarthy has already done so – but would give the Commission some advice, if you will permit me. Firstly, I hope that Mrs Kuneva will continue her work, and I hope that she can get a draft horizontal directive adopted. However, you will only achieve this if, firstly, you very precisely assess the impact on all national legislations, which has not been done; secondly, if you position this proposal very precisely in relation to existing and proposed regulations, directives and agreements at Community level, which has not been done; thirdly, if you very precisely stipulate that some rules of principle, such as on hidden defects, are safeguarded, which has not been done; and, fourthly, if you indicate – and this is the most important point – what level of protection will result from implementing the directive, and not just what the provisions will be. In this respect, the proposal is not what you would call a clear document. Yet that is what we need: harmonisation which increases the level of protection. In short, Commissioner, you have been rather hasty. My advice would be to take some time – your time – and, with this time, to present all the arguments that will allow you to totally convince the governments and this European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal being submitted to you is a positive measure for artists, for art and for culture, and our Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will support it. Indeed, what is before you now is a compromise that strives to take account of the various points of view and the various interests and which – and this is the interesting part – is liable to be adopted by the Council, which so far has come up against a small blocking minority. This compromise improves the Commission’s proposal. It makes the relationships between producers and performers fairer thanks to a clause that permits performers to exercise their rights where they are not exercised by producers. It guarantees fairer conditions for session musicians in relation to soloists. Session musicians will benefit from a permanent 20% levy. Under the Spanish Presidency we are going to give thought to extending the proposal to the audiovisual sector, that is, to producers and actors. In terms of broadcasters, I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for the declaration you just made, and I believe that a very precise declaration should in fact be attached to the Council’s common position so that matters relating to the radio broadcasting of music are not jeopardised. We are talking here about real revenue; session musicians are going to see their income tripled, to reach up to EUR 2 000. Consumers’ interests are not harmed since extending the term of protection does not increase prices. Libraries’ interests are not harmed since libraries do not pay royalties to performers or record producers. They pay them only to authors, and, even then, there are many exceptions. This is why I am profoundly grateful to Mr Crowley, Mrs Gill, Commissioner McCreevy and the Commission for all of this work. It reflects the state of the world, increased life expectancy and new uses for works, and this is why we must adopt this text – to try to ensure that it is made definitive at first reading.

 Madam President, I would like to welcome the discussion and the adoption of this European private company statute and I would like in particular to praise our rapporteur, Mr Lehne. I think that the text that will be adopted by this House will, in a way, carry his name and the European private company will be known to posterity as the Klaus-Heiner Lehne company. I would just like to comment on one point. I share the view that Mr Becsey has just expressed. I believe that the provisions for worker participation proposed in the compromise run counter to the agreed objective, in other words run counter to the ease and effectiveness of this statute for small and medium-sized enterprises. I think it is a mistake to introduce worker participation at such a level, in other words in such small companies. I understand perfectly well the attachment to a system of social and economic management which has proven its worth. I think that, in this case, we are losing some of the effectiveness of the statute we are proposing and that is going to be adopted, by imposing worker participation systems on small companies when such systems, I feel, are only suitable for large companies. However, aside from this reservation, I think that this text is excellent.

 Mr President, I would like to add my support to the line taken by Mr Schwab a few moments ago. I would say that adopting this directive today is a major decision and we owe it to the very remarkable efforts of our rapporteur, Mr Lambsdorff, our shadow rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, whom I thank and naturally, the French Presidency who, at the end of last year, made great efforts to achieve a compromise. In fact, what we are doing today is to finish a cycle which has been remarkably fast, that is to say a few months, which includes both the directive on the internal market in defence products, adopted in December, the Code of Conduct for exports, which became law at the same time and, finally, this directive reconciling Article 296 of the Treaty with the common rules on public contracts. In fact, this whole set, so to speak, commits us to what I will call ‘communitisation’ of the defence economy. This might, of course, appear to be inimical to the desire for sovereignty or even to the very characteristics of defence policies. In fact, this translates a desire for integration of state sovereignties. The same thing will be noted in the field of justice. Throughout the French Presidency and since the Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies, enormous progress has been made in yet another field in which national sovereignties wished to block any agreement or cooperation. In fact, ladies and gentlemen, by adopting such a text, I believe we are helping to bring an end to the ideological debate on the nature and form of the European project. It is an area and a power, and it will be increasingly recognised in the fields of defence and foreign policy.

Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, our coordinator, Mr Lehne, and our shadow rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, for their efforts to arrive at a position that I consider to be extremely effective and reasonable. Indeed, we are well aware that we need to adapt our rules to the specific circumstances of small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is why we very strongly support the plan for small and medium-sized enterprises that has been proposed by the Commission and endorsed by the Council. Nevertheless, I would add that we must not do this, as it were, by regarding these small and medium-sized enterprises as sub-enterprises, by putting them in a kind of ghetto where there would be so many simplifications and so few rules that they would no longer provide the guarantees that enable them, in particular – and especially in the current crisis – to obtain the credit they need in order to operate and grow. This is why I, like Mr Gauzès, very strongly support the resolution proposed by Mrs van den Burg and adopted by our committee, a resolution that is about asking the Commission to submit a proposal that would enable the Member States to exempt businesses that are characterised by their very small size – a balance sheet of less than EUR 500 000, a turnover of less than EUR 1 million and a staff complement of less than 10 people – and that have only local or regional operations in a single Member State, from having to comply with the directive. This will therefore enable the Member States to adapt their legislation, as Germany has done, but at the same time to treat small and medium-sized enterprises like the others – that is very important. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not develop separately; Europe must take action to ensure that they are not at a disadvantage with regard to the others.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister of Justice, it is precisely in this capacity that I should like to address you at the end of this debate. Indeed, with the Portuguese Presidency, the Slovenian Presidency and, today, the French Presidency, that is, Rachida Dati as Keeper of the Seals, I truly believe – and I say this in the light of my experience as a former justice minister – that we in Europe have passed a milestone and that we will not go back. Today, an attempt is being made to have the legal and judicial systems – which are, however, by nature suspicious of one another – come closer together, recognise one another and harmonise. There is even, on certain points, a move to embark upon legislation that is wholly or partly Community-based, such as, for example, legislation on maintenance obligations. It follows that, even beyond what we have done when the need dictates, for example in relation to security, criminal law and the fight against terrorism, we are now addressing those who need rules and dispute settlements that apply throughout Europe, because they live, by definition, in their country but also elsewhere, because they work and because they have relationships with everyone across Europe. This point must be stressed, Mr President. It is without doubt the hallmark of the French Presidency. All of my fellow Members have said so, but it must be emphasised that this is without doubt an historic milestone that has been passed, with regard to cooperation and legislation in the field of justice. Europe, I believe, will no longer be the same if people genuinely feel that the European judicial area is something more than just fine words.

On Monday evening Mr Verheugen gave a very precise account of the content of the three declarations that Mr Barrot has provided. This was merely a formal deposition of these declarations. As Commissioner Verheugen said on Monday evening, we can and must vote; this is our responsibility towards European consumers. (Applause)

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, counterfeiting is an economic, social and health menace of a size that, in my view, is often underestimated. Some people estimate that a third of the goods docked in containers at Antwerp or Rotterdam are counterfeits. I did say ‘a third’, and these are estimates produced by official departments. I would like to say very clearly, and I am not going to beat about the bush, that I am truly disappointed by the European Parliament’s proposals and by the debate this evening. For once, I am more disappointed by Parliament than by the Commission or the Council, since in this sphere, the Council and the Commission have done their work. The action plan of 25 September, the seminar held on 25 November and the proposals which Mr Barrot has just set out on behalf of the Commission are real actions, not fine words. Commissioner, what I would simply like to say to you is that I would really like the observatory, for example, to be made operational during the first half of 2009 and for the regulation on market surveillance adopted by the Council to be adopted in this Parliament. As far as Mr Susta is concerned, I am not speaking here of his alternative proposal for a resolution, which unfortunately we are not going to debate. I am speaking of his report. It is much too weak, much too timid, and says nothing on indications of origin, says nothing on the observatory and is timid and reticent regarding the protection of intellectual and industrial property. You talk of ACTA and say that we need to adopt it, but you say that we should not use the means that would be effective in enforcing it. In addition, I must say that I was staggered by the comments made by my two fellow Members from Sweden, who give the impression that the danger comes not from counterfeiting but from the fight against counterfeiting. Ladies and gentlemen, we are completely mistaken if we do not take more resolute action. We are dealing with this subject as if it were a marginal economic activity, no more than that, whereas it could mark the end of our industries, it could signal widespread exploitation of workers from the emerging countries, let us not forget, and finally, could amount to widespread lack of safety for consumers. We must take action!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to emphasise, in this matter, how capable the Community institutions are of reacting in order to effectively resolve the problems of our fellow citizens. It was in summer 2007 that a number of scandals occurred. Parliament called for measures to be taken. The Commission made efforts and, today, we are in a position to adopt this directive on the safety of toys, which marks a considerable step forward. Naturally we owe this first and foremost – this ought to be emphasised – to our rapporteur and to the work that has been done to reconcile what were, at the start, conflicting positions. Today, we have an effective and balanced text that, for example, will make it possible – and the Commission has just committed itself to this – to re-examine the standard that applies to children’s books and that deals in a very balanced way with the fragrances present in a number of toys. This is the perfect example of legislation by Europeans for Europeans, and it must be said that this House has played a crucial role in it.

Mr President, I am really delighted with the adoption of this draft directive, since, for the first time, a Community instrument is going to simplify transfers between Member States in an extremely sensitive area, that of defence-related products. This is a real step forward for the internal market in defence equipment. We owe it both to the work of Parliament, and, in particular, of our rapporteur, Mrs Rühle, and to the efforts that have been made by the Council and the Commission since our discussions, a month ago, since we voted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. This text has a twin objective: an industrial policy objective – and this is excellent for the arms industries in Europe – and an internal market objective, which is to facilitate the movement of these products while taking account of their specific characteristics. Indeed, we have struck a balance that enables us to guarantee that the Member States’ security interests will be preserved, since continuing reference is made to Articles 30 and 296 of the Treaty, and that the Member States will be able to pursue the intergovernmental, letter-of-intent-type cooperation that is under way. This text goes a long way to increasing the mutual confidence between the Member States, with regard to transfers, thanks to certification and to the development of general and global licences. Exports to third countries are very clearly excluded from this text, and a clear distinction is made between the first pillar, relating to the internal market, and the second pillar. And actually, I believe that this directive should be welcomed all the more since, at the same time, that is, last week, 8 December, the Council adopted the common position on the code of conduct, and it made this code of conduct binding, after it had been at a standstill for three years. This was a request by Parliament, and today it is fulfilled. In the same way, this text is part of a revival of the European Security and Defence Policy, which the European Council just decided on on Friday, and, for example, we shall succeed in achieving this famous objective, 60 000 men in 60 days. It is clear that we are making both good savings and good external policy.

 Mr Jouyet, when Nicole Fontaine was putting her question, the Council was already answering. That is rare enough to be worthy of note. In fact, 48 hours ago, the Competitiveness Council examined and supported the plan put forward by the Commission in July, while our Parliament is still considering it. That is an undeniable success for the Council under the French Presidency and I would like to thank you, Mr Jouyet, and pay tribute to the good work that you and your colleagues have done, in particular Mr Novelli. The Council’s success is particularly notable because the Commission’s plan meant that you had to add an action plan, taking the principles it contained and setting goals for the next 3, 5 and 10 years. I understand that, in practical terms, what we have to do now is to consider small and medium-sized enterprises first in every piece of legislation and in every measure. We will do this with the European private company, with the late payments directive, with, I hope, cuts in VAT rates, and so on. I would simply like to say, however, to conclude, that above all SMEs must not be ghettoised, in other words the SME regulations we introduce must not be so singular that they end up forming a handicap. I agree with what Mrs Vlasto just said. It is obvious that in the current situation, when these businesses are in such need of funding and obtaining finance is so difficult, we must not take measures on their behalf, for example accounting guarantee exemptions, that cut their credits and therefore prevent them from having the means to operate. It is for this reason that small and medium-sized enterprises are not sub-companies. They must be companies like any others, vital to the European economy.

 Madam President, this question is central to the future cultural economy of Europe. Despite the existence of the Directive on copyright in the information society the situation in terms of the collective management of copyright and related rights for online services is extremely complex, particularly because of the territorial nature of copyright law and the absence of a pan-European licensing system. This situation has been made even more complicated by the lack of a coherent policy on the part of the European Commission, with the Directorate-General responsible for the single market and copyright, on the one hand, and the DG for competition policy, on the other, often acting for their own account and without any overall view of the sector concerned, especially as regards the interests of the creative talents of Europe. In fact, by refusing to legislate and also by ignoring the different resolutions adopted by Parliament and opting instead to attempt to regulate this sector by way of recommendations and administrative decisions the Internal Market and Services Directorate-General has created a climate of legal uncertainty. Against this background we now have the Directorate-General for Competition starting legal proceedings against a player in this sector that was only trying to act in compliance with the Commission recommendation of 2005. Thus the Commission took this decision against CISAC in July. It did not impose financial penalties but rather sought to change the way that CISAC and its member associations operated. This situation reflects the fact that the European Commission chose to ignore the warnings that had been expressed by Parliament, particularly in its resolution of 13 March 2007, which also contained concrete proposals for controlled competition as well as for the protection and encouragement of minority cultures within the European Union. Moreover, since then we have seen a whole series of initiatives, only one of which has been legislative in nature: a far-fetched appraisal of the recommendation on collecting societies, an assessment report and Green Paper on the 2001 Directive, questions about home copying, free access by way of a decision of the Directorate-General for Research to 20% of the calls for tender under the Seventh Framework Programme, a time extension to the rights of performing artists, for which a directive is to be considered, and so on. This is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has posed the following question: does the Commission not think that it would be preferable to make sure that any changes imposed, for example on CISAC members, should be subject to a broad consultation of all the interested parties so as to put an end to the incongruity of the present legal situation that has resulted from the divergent positions adopted by the Commission? Does the European Commission intend to reconsider its policy in this sector in the light of Parliament’s resolution of 13 March 2007 so that a global approach may be found that takes into account not only the interests of the users but also the interests of the licence holders and of the creative community? We are convinced that the CISAC case demonstrates that the approach the Commission has taken by adopting non-mandatory provisions, or ‘soft law’ as it is called, or by way of purely administrative decisions, is inconsistent and contrary to the principle of legal certainty because the parties affected by it have no means of appeal or discussion. Tomorrow the Commission intends to continue with this ‘soft law’ approach by adopting another recommendation, this time on creative content online, which will also deal with the issue of multi-territory licensing. This will not be a recommendation under the codecision procedure. Does the Commission plan to involve Parliament in drawing up this recommendation in an effective manner? Or, in this sector that is so crucial for the future economy and culture of Europe, is the Commission once again going to ignore those who represent the Member States and their citizens? For this reason I have two suggestions to make. Firstly, as it has done for home copying, the Commission should put in place a platform for all the stakeholders so that this dossier can be opened and examined by all those who have a need to know. Parliament, for its part, will give its opinion either way. The Committee on Legal Affairs has now set up an ad hoc
 working group on copyright issues with a remit to present all the stakeholders with a clear long-term global vision of intellectual and artistic property and of its role in the knowledge and cultural economy. This group is to hold its first meeting tomorrow morning.

 Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this work has been outstanding. The result that has been achieved by our committees is a balanced one, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you were quite right to want to take it fully into account. I should just like to congratulate my colleagues, Catherine Trautmann, Pilar del Castillo and Malcolm Harbour, on their work. That being the case, I have no problem telling Mrs Trautmann that I do not agree with her view that we should exclude completely any reference to intellectual property rights. Over and above the platforms and channels that we are discussing, especially in her report, what is of importance to us all is what these platforms and channels allow us to access, in other words, content. Mr Guardans, Mr Medina and Mr Mavrommatis have made that point very well indeed, and I agree with them. In the Commission text, two references had been made to this issue; it would have been better to have retained them. The debate is now focused on a reference made to the 2001 and 2004 Directives on copyright and on cooperation among the various stakeholders. To what end? To promote legal offers – in other words, content that will enable our industry and our cultural diversity to prosper. The criticisms that have been levelled at these texts – some of which I have heard repeated even here in this Chamber – have, for example, raised the spectre of the Olivennes Agreement. However, the model that we should follow is the Memorandum of Understanding that was adopted on 24 July by the UK Government, OFCOM and the various stakeholders. As far as I am aware, they do not support bureaucracy or Internet dictatorship. The point is not to prevent laws from being enforced in the Member States, to ensure reconciliation with fundamental rights, and not to prevent new technologies and the new economy from acting for the benefit of our cultural diversity, our cutting-edge industries and the intelligence and talents of European citizens, for these are our most important weapons and our greatest assets in global competition.

 Madam President, I must reiterate what Mrs Buitenweg has just said. The question raised by these texts, as by all the progress made in this area in the last 20 years, is very simple: in the European Union, as stated by my colleague Jean-Paul Gauzès, do we first of all take into account the interests of the people, in particular honest people, or do we first of all take into account the interests of the States and the mechanisms of State? It is clear that European construction – and this may be regretted but it is a fact and a positive fact in today’s world – involves ensuring that the mechanisms of State of the 27 Member States cannot, as they have done for too long, prevail over the interests of the people and in particular the interests of security. This is the whole purpose of the European project, otherwise there is no European project. The Council and these three proposals must therefore be supported.

 Mr President, our colleague Mr Meyer has correctly indicated the challenges of this issue. I should like to say to the Commissioner that I do understand your technical answer on the translations, but what Mr Meyer said on this subject absolutely embodies the real issue: how do you go from university work to a political decision and a legal decision? I believe it is absolutely vital that everyone understands this because this draft Common Frame of Reference (CFR) that was presented to you at the end of last year must be considered in relation to all the work done on this issue, and not just the draft presented to you. For example, it is clear that a choice must be made between the law of obligations and the law of contract. There are several schools of thought on this but this is the choice that we must make and, to do so, there must of course be several proposals on the table. Likewise, will the content of the CFR be restricted and therefore binding or will it be general and therefore much more indicative? As a result of all this, we need a range of information and it is of course essential that Parliament can do its work, and that it can do this at a very early stage. That is why – and I will conclude on this very practical point – it is very important that many Members participate in the hearing that the Commission will organise with experts at the beginning of October and in the conference that the French Presidency of the European Union will hold in Paris on 23 and 24 October. This subject merits open and transparent debate that goes beyond the experts and involves those responsible for the political decisions.

 Madam President, the report by our colleague Ria Oomen-Ruijten is thorough, honest and courageous at a very testing time for Turkey, and I wish to congratulate her on this. The report, however, forms part of a genre that I feel is becoming increasingly unreal. Parliament and many other institutions are carrying on with their pretences, as though our tireless teachings can change Turkey. This, in fact, is the crux of the matter: the contradiction between this country, this nation, this great people, its evolution and the project we wish to operate together. Turkey is a nation-state, one of the last of its kind, one of the strongest and one of the most aware. Its unity is a nationalist unity, and this is clearly discernable in relation to the acknowledgement of genocide in Armenia. Its policy is increasingly inspired by a single religion even as it backs away from the secular aspects that form the very basis of its constitution. It manifests its desire for independence, while here we wish to implement a principle of integration and delegation of powers and sovereignty. This is nothing other than a head-on collision between both parties. Let us be under no illusions, let us refrain from telling the Turks anything and everything, and having them believe we are willing either to accept their accession without actually meeting the Copenhagen criteria, or reject it because of them, when what is actually at stake is us, and what we want our European project to be. Furthermore, let us define a durable partnership structure that uses a win-win approach to allow Turkey to take up its role as a regional power, and the EU to continue the construction of its world identity.

By voting against the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the situation in Turkey, the French UMP Delegation wishes to state that the Commission, the Member State Governments and the European Parliament are wrong to continue stoking the illusion of Turkey’s accession. The UMP is not opposed to Ria Oomen-Ruijten’s report, which is an excellent piece of work, but to a refusal to take into consideration the reality of Turkey and its policy, at odds with our project for European integration.

 Commissioner, it is true that we are extremely disappointed to see how the freedom of provision of services is being applied in case law. One might be forgiven for thinking that, in some interpretations, the ECJ has sought to establish the pre-eminence of articles 43 and 49 over every other consideration. However, I am wary of Manichean analyses of these case-law decisions, which, as you all know, are first and foremost test cases. I believe that the question we need to ask ourselves is how to guarantee the social acquis. More specifically, we need to answer two questions. Firstly, what wage level must companies be subjected to under the national laws of the host country? Secondly, to what extent can we restrict the collective action of trade unions intended to ensure equal treatment of national and posted workers? In answer to these questions, I do not believe in a change in the Posting of Workers Directive. I even think that we would be taking a huge risk in attempting this. Conversely, I find the European Trade Union Confederation’s proposal for a social clause more interesting. I think that this is quite simply, as Mr Brok said, a case of applying the treaties, both old and new: Article 3.3, Article 6.1 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is now substantive law. We also need to enforce – and the national parliaments could supervise this – the principle of subsidiarity in all that concerns the right to work, workers’ rights and the right to strike in particular. In the more immediate future, the French Presidency is about to launch the Social Agenda. For you, Commissioner, the Commission must go further than the point that you made and the minimum administrative recommendation for a more political text, taking full account of the uncertainties arising from case law.

 Madam President, colleagues, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I should like firstly to applaud the quality of the work done by our colleague Alexander Stubb, with whom – I would add – we enjoyed close cooperation. I am pleased to see that, in line with our proposals, clear definitions have been included of what constitutes a technical rule and of the exclusions, and I am particularly glad that the tricky problem of language has been resolved. We are all aware, too, that the primacy of the General Product Safety Directive has been recognised in one of the recitals, and I will touch on that in a moment. Moreover, in the Brie report, we have an assurance that industrial products can be made as safe as possible. With regard to reversing the burden of proof, which is the basic principle of the text on mutual recognition, we have also succeeded in placing responsibility on certain economic operators, and not just on administrative authorities. Lastly, in relation to the deadline for making the regulation applicable, I think that nine months is a sufficiently long time. Those are the main points that have been taken on board from my opinion. Considering the three texts as a package, I would say that – thanks to the three rapporteurs and to very thorough discussions in all our committees – they successfully reconcile opening the internal market, in other words removing barriers, with the concern for safety which has become so evident especially since last summer. With regard to mutual recognition, intelligent solutions have been found in relation to precious metals and to weapons, both of which had been problematic. With regard to surveillance and product marking, the possibility of revising the General Product Safety Directive in the next five years is, in my view, essential, as are the insistence on rules for national marking and the call for a study of European marking. I believe that what we have before us, Madam President, is a first-class legislative package.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution on relaunching the Lisbon Strategy is very much in line with the report which Parliament adopted last October, on my proposal, on the future strategy for the Single Market. I should like first of all to thank Marianne Thyssen and Klaus-Heiner Lehne, along with all their colleagues in the Coordination Group, for having drafted a resolution which is both well balanced and in step with the political, economic and social reality in the EU. I should like to draw particular attention to the proposals concerning the importance of social rights and reconciling economic competitiveness with the social model: what I would say is that we must, of course, go much further here and adopt the provisions on services of general interest. I would also underline what the report says about intellectual property. This is a major weapon for the EU and for SMEs. The international dimension which the resolution introduces is something new, and very necessary. The Single Market is what puts Europe’s 500 million citizens in a position of strength in a globalised world. Lastly, I would just like to say a few words on the question of method. I am not sure that the open method of coordination, which is the method currently used, is the most effective. I personally think that in a number of areas of the Lisbon Strategy we need to move on to genuinely common policies, Community policies, if we want to be successful in the future.

 The vote on the draft directive on consumer credit denotes significant progress in the eyes of French MPs from the UMP [Union pour un Mouvement Populaire/Union for a Popular Movement]. Indeed, thanks to the contribution made by the European Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, the final text encourages the opening of borders in an important area of daily life, while preserving the existing rights of consumers, notably French consumers. The transposition of the directive will therefore make it possible to offer better credit conditions in future, and to limit the risk of people taking on too much debt.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal intends to allow companies other than manufacturers to produce spare parts, on the basis that this will reduce the price of parts and insurance. This is the idyllic presentation we have heard from the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services. There is nothing to show that there will be any real benefit to consumers. The countries that have already removed protection have not observed any obvious progress. The Commission’s own surveys confirm this, as our rapporteur Klaus-Heiner Lehne has just told us. Removal of intellectual property for designs and models in many industries, not just in the car industry, however, conflicts directly with EU economic and commercial strategy. This means opening the door to forgeries, and offering the chance to dangerous competitors such as China or India to embark on furious production of these items. This is the total opposite of the Lisbon Strategy which wanted to make intellectual property the weapon of competitiveness and innovation. We would certainly be giving our competitors the wrong message with this strategy, and it would be contrary to EU interests within the context of globalisation. Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal is outdated. It is inspired by an ideological attitude which, in 2007, is precariously balanced, since we are now engaged in a crucial battle with new economic giants in order to ensure the survival of our industry. It is hardly the time to throw down our weapons. Commissioner Mandelson goes to Beijing to force the Chinese to respect intellectual property, while over here we are now calling this into question. This proposal ought to be simply abandoned as unrealistic and irresponsible. Now that we are debating the issue, we must behave as good legislators. That is why, at the very least, we lend our support to the rapporteur’s compromise and call on the House to vote for the amendment as signed by 53 Members for a transitional period of eight years.

 Prime Minister, I will limit my remarks to the issue of immigration, a major concern for the future of Europe in relation to which you made some consensual proposals. It is true that nobody can teach any lessons in such a difficult area, but it is also true that nobody can feel they are exempt from the solidarity required in a unified space. Opinion polls show that certain countries have a more economic approach, and others a more cultural approach. In countries that place economic interests first, of course it is convenient to secure essential labour by adapting the laws, and hence the regularisation measures occasionally adopted en masse
 by national governments, without worrying too much about the concern that this causes, while the other Member States attempt to control migratory flows. We could mention, for example, your government’s operation to regularise hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. France expressed its regret and disapproval at the time. Our President was quite candid about it. There must be no repetitions of this kind of operation in the future. All the more so since Spain legitimately receives EU funds to deal with the dramatic situations on its African borders. The PPE advocates policies based on individual processing of applications for regularisation, and therefore refuses to accept en masse
 regularisations which do nothing but increase concerns. Along the same lines, the French Presidency will propose a European immigration pact. Moreover, Prime Minister, in the years to come, the Lisbon Treaty will provide the means to act in unison and refrain from implementing go-it-alone policies. This is in the long-term interest of the European Union, Spain and all the Member States.

In line with the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I believe that the Commission has exceeded its brief here and that the European Union does not need to issue new instructions to the Member States. It is a matter of national responsibility. I see it as an artificial exercise to seek to issue identical prescriptions to countries with extremely diverse legal traditions and environmental circumstances. The Commission should therefore review its proposal and identify specifically those situations where European legislation is called for.

 The purpose of Mr Dumitrescu’s question is to remind the Commission of its responsibilities. Through its recommendation of September 2005 and its decision to call into question the territorial competence of CRMs, the Commission has upset the relationship between rights-holders and national collecting societies – and this has happened outside the context of any legislation or harmonisation measures. Under the guise of adaptation to the digital environment, the Commission has introduced confusion into the European system of author’s rights and related rights. That in turn has encouraged concentration and a format-based approach, to the detriment of artists and to the advantage of industrialists and other economic operators. The Commission urgently needs to stop taking random initiatives without serious assessment of their impact; it needs to examine the situation in all the arts and cultural sectors, in conjunction with all the stakeholders, and to adopt a comprehensive policy that will reflect the requirements of cultural diversity, as well as Europe’s values and the Lisbon Strategy objectives based on the knowledge and innovation economy; and it needs to present Parliament and the Council with coherent draft directives respecting the principles that I have mentioned.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an own-initiative report suggested by our political group which, after several months' work, is supported by a very large majority in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I must welcome that very wide support, because if it is confirmed by Parliament in plenary we shall be able to participate fully in the work currently being done by the Commission on drawing up a communication for next autumn on internal market strategy for the twenty-first century, and to influence that work to the full. The internal market has been the main achievement of the European Union in over 50 years. It is at the heart of European integration and now the Lisbon Strategy. It is, however, a constantly evolving process and we need above all to approach it from a political standpoint. That is, in my opinion, the most original feature of the report I am submitting to you. Europe is going through a very unsettled period and it is important to realise that the internal market cannot be developed if it continues to face widespread scepticism and indeed hostility from the public, who often see the internal market and competition policy as the root causes of many of the social problems our citizens are experiencing. Any internal market strategy must therefore be aimed at turning that lack of belief and that hostility into confidence in the internal market, partly by drawing attention to its benefits and partly by, at the same time, pursuing the aims of openness and competition and of social cohesion with its various components: the environment, employment, culture, access for the vulnerable. In our report we have tried to strike that balance and I think that the reason it has received such wide support is that it has largely succeeded. That is the main recommendation we want to make to the Commission: the internal market cannot be extended and developed if our fellow citizens do not support the policy. So we have suggested three approaches: restoring confidence, reducing burdens and, finally, placing our internal market policy in an international context. That is why we have placed an emphasis on all the aspects, such as the environment and consumer protection, that affect the quality of life of our fellow citizens. We have asked that the national parliaments should be more closely involved in our work in that respect, that they should have a better understanding of the advantages of the single market. An important amendment that I have drawn up, which will, I think, meet with general approval, is the revised Amendment 12. In that amendment, which is based on the European Council decisions of 21 June on the mandate given to the Intergovernmental Conference with a view to including a paragraph on public services in the new amending Treaty, we call upon the Commission to clarify the position of the public services, SGIs and SGEIs, because we believe that those services play a very important part in a successful internal market that enjoys public support. We already realised that when we were discussing the directive on the internal market in services. We have also placed a great deal of emphasis on SMEs and on vulnerable persons, especially the disabled. As regards the development of the right to consumption, we note that there is very little cross-border consumption, around 6%, which is obviously too little. We are naturally including energy policy and action against global warming in the internal market policies, as well as the opening up of network industries. One of the main – and controversial – proposals is to incorporate an Internal Market Test in any new legislation. That was all I wanted to say in my brief speech. If we are successful in combining the inherent strength of the internal market and the commitment of producers and consumers to this policy, I think that will be a real boost for prosperity, employment and preservation of the European social model and will, at the same time, give Europe a strong economic position in the world.

Mr President, we are dealing with a text which, from a technical and legal point of view, is of great practical importance, because it is actually about preserving the possibilities for recourse for candidates for public contracts by establishing a period suspending the awarding of the contract, in other words a period between the contract being awarded and the contract being signed, in order to enable unsuccessful candidates to lodge an appeal, in the knowledge that it is much better to try to object to a contract being signed than to win damages once the contract had been signed. This proposal also establishes effective measures for combating the illegal direct awarding of contracts. The discussion with the Council was based on the excellent report by Mr Fruteau, mainly on the issue of penalties to void contracts that have been awarded in violation of the standstill period, which we achieved at the end of the trilogue. The Member States therefore have the opportunity to establish substitution penalties for violations of the standstill period, and this proposal has our support. It is a good compromise. The ineffectiveness penalty for violations and the possibility of applying other penalties, and therefore of leaving some room to manoeuvre for the national courts in the event of violation of the standstill period, is a good formula, and we approve it.

Madam President, Mr Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection recommends that you adopt the Council common position, modified by some amendments: an amendment comprising a safeguard clause at the end of the transitional periods, a provision encouraging the extension of unit pricing, a system for guaranteeing that British bread can continue to be marketed in its current sizes and, finally, a declaration by the Commission that can explain and guarantee exactly the phasing out of stocks of bottles that are off-specification. However, the heart of this directive is, on the one hand, freedom in sizing and, on the other, mandatory sizes, for five years, for milk, pasta, butter and coffee and, for six years, for white sugar. That is what is proposed to you. How have we reached this point? At first reading, on the basis of its own study, the European Parliament retained mandatory sizes for a number of products, in permanent derogation in relation to the general liberalisation of sizes that was proposed by the Commission. The latter, in a position of principle, set out a revised proposal that was totally opposed to Parliament’s text. It was then that I was able to resume talks with the Commission and the Finnish Presidency of the Council. The latter succeeded in achieving the adoption of a common position that took up some of the derogations requested by the European Parliament, but only for a limited period, a transitional period. I proposed accepting the main points of this position, provided that it was accompanied by two additional guarantees. Firstly, that the Commission can propose continuing to keep certain mandatory sizes for certain mass-marketed products if consumers experienced disruption at the end of the transitional period and, secondly, that the Member States should be encouraged to extend unit pricing to local shops. That is what the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection decided on on the basis of my proposal and it is also what we agreed with the Council and the Commission at the end of two trialogues held over recent weeks. Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, I shall draw three lessons from this legislative procedure. Firstly, on this occasion, we have, for the first time, carried out an impact assessment. We commissioned this assessment from an independent body, and it was the first time that Parliament had used this procedure, which has, I believe, a great future. Secondly, what we are doing means that better lawmaking does not necessarily consist in doing away with all legislation because - and this is the third lesson I have drawn - through this debate, we have strictly taken into account the needs of consumers, and, in particular, the most vulnerable consumers. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I propose that our Parliament vote tomorrow for the three amendments that have been adopted by the Commission on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.

Mr President, we all want to make progress and successfully clamp down on counterfeiting, which is economically, socially and culturally unacceptable, and Mr Zingaretti has worked hard to come up with this compromise proposal. However, I am struck, in this debate, by the great confusion among those who, in defending consumers, scorn the rights of creators and performers and those who, at the same time, defend Community competence and want the national judiciaries to remain sovereign entities. I believe that there are some real problems there that deserve to be looked at in more depth. I have clear ideas about one point, anyway, and that is the cultural impact of this text. I am referring to the amendments to Articles 2 and 3 that were adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs. They propose definitions of intellectual property rights. That is not the aim of the directive. They propose a restrictive wording of intentional infringement and commercial scale. This goes against the discretion of the national courts and, above all, in fact, it falls short of making peer-to-peer file sharing a criminal act. The result is that the provisions, on the one hand, go against the acquis communautaire
, particularly the 2001 Directive on copyright, and, on the other hand, present a considerable risk for creation and cultural diversity, by undermining the national laws that curb such behaviour, prejudicing as it does the rights of authors and performers. That is why, in this instance, I support the wording of the original proposal by the Commission and, in any case, in our debate, Amendment 30 tabled by Mrs Bowles. We are on very serious ground as far as cultural diversity is concerned.
 Jacques Toubon (PPE-DE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Lévai and Mr Mavrommatis for their excellent proposals. This report is timely because intellectual and artistic property is now being called into question in the European Union. On the undoubtedly legitimate grounds of the technology revolution, which is profoundly changing the way in which we access artistic creations and cultural assets, the Commission has been proposing for some months to reduce the pay of authors, composers, performers and all rightholders in general. It fully supports the view shared by manufacturers and consumers that online distribution can be free of charge. I condemn this deadlock, this illusion of free online services. If creators and performers are no longer paid by copyright and related rights, one day there will no longer be any creation, any new music, or any new films. What will we put on the network then? We were able to stop the draft Commission recommendation, which attacked the system of compensation for private copying, but it is still on the table. In each of our countries, we have transposed the 2001 Directive and safeguarded the status of rightholders. The Commissioner for Competition has decided to put a stop to the territorial scope of national collective rights management societies. The recommendation on the collective cross-border management of copyright and related rights for online music comes under the same dangerous concept. It has also had a harmful impact, since the German and British societies have created one joint society to which a very important record producer has entrusted the exclusive rights to its international catalogue. Mrs Levai is therefore right to challenge the Commission option, which relies more on an inadequate consultation process. Her proposal, which safeguards local repertoires, does seem to us, however, to be a little too favourable to distributors and thus carries the risk of dumping, to the detriment of rightholders. However, I hope that this report, in its current form, is adopted so that the Commission knows that, where very sensitive areas are concerned, the European Parliament refuses to see European law escape the legislator and wants all points of view to be taken into consideration without bias. This is also what is meant by cultural diversity.

Mr President, the European institutions are finally getting down to the main points. What is the European Union? What does it want? Who can be part of it? I hope that, thanks to the Stubb and Brok resolutions, our European Parliament will clearly help to abandon the pretence and stop forging ahead with the enlargement strategy. Integration capacity is very well defined by the three elements that appear in paragraph 8 of the Brok report. As far as we are concerned, priority must be given to political projects and not just to the institutions. We are against enlargement leading to the dismantling of common policies. It is true that integration capacity, as rightly defined by Mr Stubb, does not constitute an accession criterion, but a condition for moving on to accession. For the time being, we believe, like Mr Stubb, that a further enlargement cannot take place without new decision-making mechanisms, without new resources and without new representation of the Union. That is the conclusion that we currently draw from the unfortunate comparison between the accession to the Union of the 12 new Member States, which is a success, and the Treaty of Nice, which, for its part, is totally inadequate. Let us be as clear-sighted in our reasoning regarding Turkey. The General Affairs Council has noted the consequences of Cyprus’ situation, which is, of course, intolerable, but are we not just talking here about another diplomatic deception? The suspension is in danger of being ineffective and of doing nothing to change Turkey’s attitude. Our position must be reaffirmed; the Union is in no position to integrate Turkey, but must implement a privileged partnership with this country, which is crucial to Europe. Let us stop pretending; this is a question of interests and of Turkey and of the European Union. Enlargement is not an end in itself; it is a means of building Europe's political project.

Mr President, allow me to table a procedural motion: as is inevitably the case, there are many small problems, many slight contradictions between language versions in this text. I support what Mrs Hieronymi just said: that we did not want to raise these problems. We believe that, in such an important debate as this, the vote must be as simple as possible. I would like it, instead, if, when the Commission hands over this text to the Council, these linguistic contradictions were removed: that is why I would like them to be recorded in our Minutes and to be taken into account, because every word counts in such an important matter as this.

Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Groote, Mrs Weisgerber and Mr Callanan, as well as the Finnish Presidency. They have done a remarkable piece of work on this issue with the aim of reaching a satisfactory compromise position, both within the Council and with all of the MEPs. The Euro 5 standard will do a great deal to help further improve air quality. In laying down harmonised rules for the manufacturing of motor vehicles with regard to their air emissions, the Euro 5 standard is part of a more general strategy aimed at dealing with the harmful effects of air pollution on people’s health and the environment. This is an important step. The timetable for applying the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards, with 2009 and 2014 respectively as the dates on which they will enter into force, is certainly demanding, but it is also manageable for the economic sector, and the introduction of a one-year extension for adopting the implementing measures will mean more flexibility for industry, which I welcome. As for access to vehicle repair information, which is an issue for manufacturers and SMEs, I am pleased at last with the compromise reached on this subject as well as on the subject of recourse, in the first instance, to the OASIS standard. I note, in particular, the opportunity provided to review the provisions on access to technical information and to consolidate them as part of the review of the directive on the approval procedure: we owe this to Mrs Weisgerber. Finally, I believe that we should remain vigilant regarding the issue of renewing the cars on the road in the Union. I would like Europe to act as the driving force and to encourage emerging countries, where the number of vehicles on the road is constantly increasing, to gradually catch up with regard to the Euro emissions standards. We now want an agreement at first reading on the basis of this compromise.
 Jacques Toubon (PPE-DE

 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech will, on this occasion, be devoted to a short assessment and a few tributes. The European Parliament has joined forces in order to draw up the directive on the internal market in services. It bears its hallmark. This is a victory for the European Parliament, a victory over European moroseness, a victory over fixed ideas, a victory for the European model, which is all about balance: the balance between necessary reforms and the preservation of the acquis 
that bring us together. The directive actually opens up the internal market in services and makes it compulsory for the Member States to do away with any obstacles to the free provision of services. This is a major prospect in terms of growth and employment for all. At the same time, the directive preserves existing Community laws, does not permit any breach of social rights, rules out the liberalisation of public services and takes account of the public interest. This compromise – as I can testify, insofar as I have followed its development since summer 2004 – stems from the proposals made by my political group and from the agreements concluded within the group between what, at the outset, were differing national and ideological positions. The statement that Mr Szájer made just now testifies to this. This directive has its origins in dialogue, which is the very substance of our parliamentary life. That is why I should like to begin by thanking not only our principal overseer, Mr Harbour, but also Mrs Thyssen, with whom I worked hand in hand, Mr Karas, Mr Szájer and Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Gebhardt, who has mastered the matter from start to finish and who has been so kind as to take me, the inexperienced MEP that I am, into consideration, and Mrs McCarthy and Mr Whitehead, whom I should certainly not like to forget. Outside Parliament, my thanks go to Mr McCreevy, who has fulfilled his promises to Parliament since the start, and also to Mr Bartenstein, who has played a decisive role. I did nonetheless hear some incredible remarks made just now. Ladies and gentlemen, it is better to let well alone. The common position represents 95% of our text. Mr President, would we really be exercising our power if we entered into a conciliation procedure, which we know will result in our having no directive? The role of Parliament, our right, is, on the contrary, to shoulder our responsibilities. That is why the French members of the UMP are going to vote in favour of the common position, by choosing what is truly important.
 Jacques Toubon (PPE-DE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, I am going to try to be both quick and slow. This report is timely, and I might add that I consider the remarks made just now to be positive. Everyone would like the European Union to intervene using methods other than simple case-law. This issue does, in fact, involve a range of businesses and services: casinos, lotteries and other games of chance via traditional means or via the Internet. Therefore, this goes far beyond simple online sporting bets, which is the subject of Mrs McCarthy’s question. While it is normal for these services to apply the principles of the internal market, Commissioner, freedom should not go hand in hand with the law of the jungle! For reasons to do with the general interest, health, morality and security, these services need to be regulated and controlled. The Member States must be able to authorise and control public and private operators in the context of fair competition. The importance of ‘cross-border’ games does, however, require us to go beyond the national framework. In this regard, the recent decision taken by the United States is the demonstration that, if those who play and who make others play cannot be controlled, then it is better to take too many precautions than not enough. That is why, Commissioner, I consider the Commission’s current approach, which is based exclusively on the Treaties and on the Court of Justice, to be inadequate and dangerous. It is clear today that the idea that the national laws are compatible with the Treaties is an unsatisfactory one. Commissioner, you must work alongside Parliament to establish complementary legislation that can organise this extremely important sector, both politically and economically, in a sound and rational manner. Let this sector develop, but let it do so in complete safety for the people and for the Member States!

Mr President, many of us abstained from voting on the Eurlings report, and we did so for the following reasons. We would have voted in favour of this report because, as I said yesterday, it is the most critical report ever adopted in this Parliament on the subject of Turkey’s behaviour towards the European Union. Unfortunately, Parliament, by means of its vote, has rejected the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession and, in spite of our vote and that of a number of our fellow Members, has also adopted a provision that implicitly provides for accession as the only outcome of the negotiations. We disagree on these two points. Nevertheless, that does not mean that we wanted to oppose the efforts made by Mr Eurlings and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. They have sent out a very strong signal on behalf of this Parliament, and that is why we abstained from voting.
 Jacques Toubon (PPE-DE
). 
 – (FR) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is excellent. We endorse it, because it marks a turning point in terms of Parliament’s becoming aware of the reality of the relations between Turkey and the European Union. The report is the most critical of all those that have been produced in this House over the last few decades. In particular, it includes three points that are of decisive importance to us: the reference to the European Union’s absorption capacity as a criterion; the crucial need for Turkey to treat Cyprus, a full member of the European Union, normally; and the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession. I must point out to my fellow French Members from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that that was part of their programme for the 2004 European elections. The adoption of this report – and we do want to see it adopted – must have political consequences. I would begin by asking the Commission to stop playing hide-and-seek and to produce, on 8 November, an authentic report and not a children’s story, as it is wont to do in this area. I would ask the Council of Ministers to take a clear-sighted and courageous approach to the situation and to think about breaking off negotiations, as they make no sense these days to the average person. Aside from the case of Turkey, it is the entire enlargement process that is at stake. From now on, no further enlargement should be embarked on until we have provided the European Union with effective decision-making mechanisms and with a sufficient budget. Pressing on in a state of illusion and hypocrisy would compromise the European project, that is to say the construction of a political union, and would further widen the gap between the common sense of the people and the blindness of the leaders.

Mr President, Mr Winkler, your Presidency can already boast of a positive track record. We congratulate you on it. As for the European Council that is due to take place, it is not in a position to take major decisions, but it may have a decisive influence on the future fate of the European Union. Paving the way for a revival or endorsing a failure: that is the challenge awaiting you. You will have to determine the strategy for future enlargements. I call on you to stop forging ahead regardless, an approach further illustrated by the opening of detailed negotiations with Turkey, even though the latter does not fulfil the political conditions and is making no further progress with regard to integrating the acquis communautaire
. From now on, we must regard the European Union’s absorption capacity as a key parameter. There can be no further enlargement without an improvement in the decision-making mechanisms, without a sufficient budget, without new resources and without a genuine agreement on the nature of the European project. This is what it is basically about: constructing a political Europe by setting out the timetable for implementing the main reforms contained in the Constitutional Treaty, which we refuse to forget about. The Convention obtained a result that cannot be overturned. We must go beyond Nice. What should the content of the European policies be? We do not want Europe to devote the bulk of its decisions to improving the internal market, that is to say, to creating a vacuum. We want a Europe that builds. We want the governments and our Parliament to draft the policies that we need: on immigration, energy, economic coordination, research, security and foreign relations. Contrary to what is claimed, Europeans want more Europe, but they want a Europe that creates forms of solidarity, that guarantees security, that makes an impact on the world and that does not just police the market. They want a Europe, too, that respects its most sacred commitments: Strasbourg as the seat of the European Parliament. A great deal of lucidity and courage will be required. We trust that you will provide evidence of this at the end of June.

I should like to pay tribute to our Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to its late chairman, Mr Whitehead, to its rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt and to the draftsman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Van Lancker. I should like to thank those at the helm of our group, to whose work we owe the draft we are debating today: Mr Harbour, the shadow rapporteur and coordinator of our group; Mrs Thyssen, our vice-chairman; and our indefatigable secretariat. I should also like to pay tribute to the work of Mrs Descamps and of Mrs Bachelot, who are both members of the French delegation. Thanks to all these men and women, we have made a significant breakthrough: the compromise is a new text. First and foremost, it establishes the internal market in services. This draft takes away from the Court of Justice the de facto monopoly it has been exercising for the past 50 years with regard to implementing the principles of the Treaties. The internal market in services is based on mutual confidence and entails administrative cooperation, the simplification of administrative procedures and the abolition of protectionist obstacles, in terms both of the setting up of service companies and of the temporary provision of services. The draft applies to services of general economic interest only where the freedom of establishment is concerned, while it excludes many essential services such as audiovisual services and the cinema, gambling activities, health care and the legal professions. The compromise therefore proposes that Parliament vote in favour of a framework act geared towards economic growth, innovation and employment. That is what the nations of Europe want. Yet the compromise also respects our model and our national collective preferences. Will the directive lead to the dismantling of our social standards? Will it cause a levelling down effect? With the Commission’s first proposal, the risk was plain to see. That is why we rejected it. The compromise proposed to you, however, constitutes a barrier to social dumping, is based on subsidiarity and adopts a sensible and restrictive approach to implementing the freedom to provide services. It is made absolutely clear that the compromise excludes social standards and labour law. Competition in the social sphere is prohibited. Many national rules are respected where freedom of establishment is concerned, and the freedom to provide services is accompanied by the guarantee that Member States can apply their national rules when doing so is justified by the public interest. This is a true compromise: it is the subject of criticism from both sides, which clearly shows that we have found a happy medium. On behalf of my French colleagues, I therefore hope that you will support the compromise by voting in favour of it by a very large majority. Doing so would be a victory for the European Parliament and it would be a victory for the European Union.

Mr President, I should like simply to point out that the Commission proposal that consists of retaining mandatory packaging ranges for a number of staple goods, in the interest of consumers, is a coherent one. On the other hand, the position that consists of accepting the Commission’s plan to retain certain mandatory sectors, while rejecting the Commission proposal, is not coherent. In the interest of consumers, and in accordance with the independent study commissioned by the European Parliament for the first time in its history, I therefore recommend voting in favour of the entire set of amendments tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which adopted them by 28 votes with one abstention.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report I am presenting on behalf on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has substantially changed the Commission proposal. It was adopted by 28 votes in favour, with one abstention. I propose accepting the deregulation of sizes, which is the Commission’s chosen solution in taking account of the case-law in the Cidrerie Ruwet 
case. The Commission also proposes retaining mandatory ranges in some specific sectors: wines, spirits, soluble coffee and white sugar. The Commission calls for this derogation to be restricted to a period of 20 years. The members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection immediately questioned the relevance of the proposal and the quality of the impact study on which it is based. I was therefore led to propose that other basic products be subject to mandatory ranges. They are coffee, butter, rice, pasta and drinking milk. The ranges I propose are quite extensive in terms of intervals, not to mention the fact that, below the smallest size and above the largest, there are no restrictions whatsoever. I also propose that it be possible to review the arrangement in eight years’ time, and not in 20 years’ time as the Commission proposes. Why is the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection presenting you with this proposal? Firstly, to protect the consumers, particularly those most vulnerable, such as the elderly and the partially sighted, who have far from fully understood the unit pricing laid down in 1998. Next, to take account of the independent impact study commissioned by our committee and confirming that deregulation would carry risks for the consumer and that it would not lead to greater competition between producers and distributors. Finally, because better lawmaking does not mean no lawmaking at all. As Lacordaire said in the 1830s: between the strong and the weak, it is liberty that oppresses and the law that sets free. You will see that this apparently insignificant and technical text enables us to ask important questions. To conclude, I will highlight three factors: an impact study that is funded by Parliament itself and that depends neither on the Commission nor on pressure groups, which is a first; a concept of ‘better lawmaking’ inspired only by the interests of our fellow citizens and not by an ideological attitude; and a concern to retain our national cultures, because our nations are very attached to their food traditions and to their consumption patterns.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the UK Presidency opened with a speech made by Mr Blair that was full of allure and ambition. From now on, we know that the only significant decision to be taken in this second – and yet altogether crucial – half-year of 2005 will be the opening of the negotiations with Turkey. Such a decision is the height of pretence and of diplomatic correctness, shows indifference to the opinion of our populations and is inconsistent with the European integration project. It is, above all, this project that we are talking about. The European Union that we desire is not the one that Turkey’s presence would force us to create. There is an incompatibility between our political Union and the destiny that this great Nation State, which we respect, wishes to pursue on a sovereign and nationalist basis. Since 15 December 2004, the situation has become even more perilous than what we have known in the past. We can clearly see that, when it comes to freedoms, rights, the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide, the situation in the region populated by the Kurds and, finally, the refusal to recognise Cyprus, the negotiations will be conducted under Turkey’s, rather than Europe’s, terms, which is a state of affairs that we have always criticised. How can it be said that, after the decision taken by the Council at the end of last year, we have now more adequately met the conditions for opening the negotiations? That is why, ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative for this Parliament, which represents the people, to give a strong signal by postponing the decision on the Ankara protocol and by saying that the negotiations cannot be opened under the conditions that there is a desire to open them under today.

 Commissioner, thank you for your very precise answer. I would simply like to stress that you have not denied the facts contained in my question and that it is precisely those facts that are particularly concerning. Even if the Swiss Institute for Comparative Law’s study is just a preliminary study on all systems, it is quite clear that contracting all the economic aspects to a university centre with companies such as Stanley Leisure, Gala Group, London Clubs International or the Camelot Group on its administrative board is nevertheless, in my opinion, far from being as objective as it should be.

 Mr President, Commissioner, we are in favour of the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. The speed of the accession process depends solely on the candidate countries and we respect the efforts currently being made in Sofia and Bucharest to this end. With regard to the admission of observers to Parliament, however, I would echo precisely what Mr Nassauer said. We must step down from our ivory tower and consider the consequences of the decisions that we, and in particular the authorities of this Parliament, are taking. It is quite clear that we cannot accept observers prior to the Commission’s report, and that we cannot accept them for Romania and Bulgaria earlier than we did for the other accession countries, that is a year before the proposed date of accession. That is why we formally support the motion tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We consider it to be extremely opportune in both political and legal terms. I would add, Mr President, Commissioner, that in general I think that, given the crisis that Europe is currently experiencing and the distrust and suspicion that many people are showing towards the European institutions, now is the time for consolidation and reflection, not a headlong rush forward. That is why I said myself that I was astounded at the way in which the Commission prepared the negotiating mandate with Turkey. I think that the European institutions are living a thousand leagues away from the reality of the European people. We must rejoin the reality of the European people, and to do that, Commissioner, we need to re-examine the negotiating mandate that you prepared with Turkey and, in order to re-examine it and to give us time to do so, we need to delay the opening of negotiations. Consolidation will mean more Europe. A headlong rush will mean a dispersed Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to return to what President Barroso said, I would first of all like to say thank you to Mr Juncker and his team. I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on having been, for almost six months, a good Presidency, I could say a full Presidency, without a moment’s rest, a committed Presidency, a political Presidency and an effective Presidency. True, the last Council did not give the results we were hoping for, but Mr Juncker has given us a clear explanation of the content of the negotiations, of the British rebate and of the funding of the common rural policy, which represents, I would remind you, just 0.4% of the EU’s GDP. We were a few millimetres from agreement, when the Presidency and the Commission had succeeded in getting most of the delegations to move kilometres, and that is really something to regret. I think that there is one subject on which the Council has been particularly discreet, to a certain extent appropriately, and that is the subject of enlargement. I, though, would like to be a little less discreet by saying that it is clear that this Presidency, up to the end of June, and the next one will have to ask themselves whether, with regard to the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, we can make it seem that, and act as if, nothing had changed since December 2004, as if Turkey had not slackened its efforts, as if Europe had produced a Constitution and as if it had produced a budget: it has no Constitution, it has no budget and Turkey has slackened its efforts. Therefore, I would say very clearly that I think that, at the moment, we are not meeting the Copenhagen criterion on the ability of the EU to take on new members without losing momentum, and I would simply say, Mr President, that it would send a very strong signal if we said to the people: Europe is taking its destiny back into its own hands by being able to state where its borders are.

 Mr President, the situation that we are now facing is called crisis. It would be futile and dangerous to deny it. Being clear, however, does not mean making gestures. We must not give up so easily. Each country has to decide on the Constitution according to its own constitutional rules. In the meantime, we must reflect on the consequences of the apparent absence of unanimous ratification so as to establish as quickly as possible a new consensus for a political Europe, which we must not give up on. Nevertheless, what Europeans have expressed by their vote or by their attitude needs close analysis and it calls first for changes in European politics and in the way they are conducted. Europe has to get out of the somewhat schizophrenic state in which it operates on a daily basis. Decisions are made at supranational level but debates are exclusively at national level. Henceforth, the debate in each country should focus on the common issues and on European interests, as was the case in the French referendum campaign. For the time being, Mr President, the European Council has to bring stability to the system as it is and show that it has clearly heard the message. For me, that means, as a priority, persuading the Central Bank to lower its key interest rate, as this is essential for growth. Otherwise, we risk collapse because of monetary inflexibility. Then we need to reach a political agreement on the financial perspective and to cut back some projects for legislation that are not meeting any real need. We need to put in place real policies for industry and research and move from discussion to decisions and from decisions to action on asylum and immigration, on justice and common policy. We need too to postpone the start of negotiations for the accession of Turkey in order to introduce into the terms of negotiation the notion of a privileged partnership. Mr President, we can overcome the crisis and move forward if we act democratically. Let us make the European policies that the people demand of us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by simply saying bravo to Mr Juncker, the President-in-Office of the Council, to Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, and his colleagues, without forgetting the Heads of State or Government. Thanks to you, I believe that this Council of 22 and 23 March has been decisive in terms of moving Europe forward. In terms of its content and its form, it has probably been one of the best Councils I have experienced. This Council has provided solutions to several issues which have been facing us for a long time. First of all, an intelligent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. I believe that in politics, including European politics, intelligence is required. Secondly, improvements and new orientations to ensure that the legislation under way is balanced. I am thinking of the directive on services, of REACH. Thirdly, the environment, at a time when Kyoto is being implemented. And finally our relations with China and European effort in the field of research. On this subject, I would like in particular to stress the historic decision taken on the launch of ITER. From this point of view, I hope that the European Union will not have to wait too long for the good will of Japan; that we negotiate with the Japanese, provided, Mr President, that the draft is launched on 14 July, because this is an essential issue, essential for Europe, for the future of energy and for young people, that is to say for those people who will be living here in 30 or 50 years’ time. This is why I fully support the joint resolution that expresses Parliament’s positive view of this extremely important and extremely positive Council.

Mr President, Commissioner, an internal market for services needs to be created, but the directive that you are proposing needs to be significantly changed, and we congratulate you for understanding this. What we want now is, first of all, for the scope of application to be reduced, and in particular for everything connected with cultural diversity and social rights to be excluded from it. We want the Community method to be applied, in other words harmonisation above all other principles. Finally, we want existing Community laws to take precedence over the new directive, in particular private international law for contractual and extra-contractual obligations and everything connected with workers rights. This, Commissioner, is how you can regain the confidence of the European Parliament. Work with us! You said yourself that we are going to amend your proposal. We are going to significantly change it. I challenge you to accept what we are going to propose. That is your mission if you really want an internal market for services.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the task of European integration has brought about the world’s largest area of law and economic freedom, but the organisation of our continent cannot stop there. Europe must become a political player, a political unit endowed with democratic power and diplomatic clout. We want a Europe of states and peoples and, consequently, we wish to strengthen people’s confidence in the European Union. That is indeed what is proposed by the Constitution signed in Rome. I again congratulate our rapporteurs, Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, and would emphasise the progress made through the new Treaty. The rapporteurs are sending out a clear message to our fellow citizens: the Constitution is fine, with the best possible wording. It proposes a more integrated, more efficient and more political Europe which is more attentive to people and stronger both internally and externally. The Constitution, as such, does not increase the competences of the EU. It prevents the emergence of a centralised superstate, it sanctions the legal personality of the EU and it gives the EU a human face in the form of a long-term President and a Foreign Minister. It also guarantees all our fellow citizens protection under the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The European Parliament is gaining ground on the European political stage. Finally, the Constitution facilitates recourse to enhanced cooperation, making it possible to face up to what will be at stake in the future. The destiny of a European country is now inseparable from the affirmation of its European personality. The Constitution represents the best way for our Member States to confront the future, starting from now. For them to be united around a document that they have all approved is very ambitious. What now will turn this ambition into a reality is the will of politicians and, in the first place, of ourselves.

 Mr President, for the French members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the question is not about Turkey. The question is: ‘What kind of Europe do we want?’ We have always wanted a political Europe in tune with world affairs, a Europe of integration and not of differentiation, a Europe of common policy and not of variable geometry. Turkey is a great country, a great people and a major civilisation. It would be unrealistic, patronising and even degrading to seek to absorb, realign and weaken the historical greatness of that world. To accept Turkey’s accession to the EU is to accept the risk of Europe becoming a society of nations, a preacher unable to practise what he preaches; of Europe dissolving into a strategic alliance that used to be against Communism, and will in the future be against terrorism; of Europe being transformed into a kind of worldwide Euro-Asian trade organisation. In other words, there is a risk that Europe will become wide open and bereft of power. The Europe that we want is not diversity at the expense of unity; it is unity in diversity, in the words of the draft Constitution maxim. This about the European Union’s Project; jumping the gun is not a project! The EU is no longer accepted by its citizens. Europe must be built by working with the peoples, not by ignoring them. It is this concept of common interest between Europe and Turkey that led us to submit essential amendments to this House, in collaboration with our German friends. I shall not detail them here, but I shall merely say that it is only by means of a privileged partnership that we can create strong ties between the futures of Turkey and Europe, without compromising either the European Project or Turkey’s historical role between Europe and Asia. Ladies and gentlemen, we must be resolute: let us dare to fight together through the fog of diplomatic conformism, to stare reality in the face and to propose to Turkey a fraternal relationship of equals with the political Union of Europe.

 Mr President, Mr Zalm, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French contingent in our Group feels that the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the pillars of the European economy and currency. We want it to be implemented in practice, so that we can keep control of public spending, combat excessive deficit and ensure sound management of Member States’ public finances. This is precisely why we support the Commission’s proposal and why we are pleased with the Council of Ministers’ positive reaction. Taking on board what has been learnt from experience, the Commission’s proposal consists, purely and simply, of making the rules of the Pact fully and intelligently enforceable, without changing the two main criteria: deficit percentage and debt percentage. The communication of 3 September builds on principles of which we approve: enabling the Commission to issue early warnings, placing the emphasis on the level of debt, establishing budget surpluses during times of economic growth to allow room for manoeuvre in times of economic slowdown – the squirrel strategy – being responsive to exceptional circumstances – a concept that the Council of Ministers should incorporate thoroughly – and, finally, coordinating the main objectives of economic policy with the decisions made in national parliaments. This proposal therefore places greater importance on economic developments and makes strenuous efforts to avoid the risks to which dogmatism is in danger of exposing business and jobs. If France can make a major contribution to growth in Europe this year, for example, it is clearly because the Pact has not been applied to it like a hatchet. We also welcome the appointment of a permanent chairman of the Eurogroup in the shape of Mr Juncker, which is a step in the right direction. In the future, budgetary policy will make a greater contribution to growth and will, accordingly, play a decisive role in achieving the Lisbon objectives, which determine the prospects for competitiveness and prosperity in the EU.

 Mr President, one moment just to tell you that this is an important report because it introduces a European regulation on rating agencies, and is therefore an element of the response to the crisis. I wish to tell you that, this morning, COREPER adopted the compromise text that has been tabled for your vote. For Parliament’s vote to comply, it is better for you to reject the amendments, except in the case of the votes on Amendment 172, corresponding parts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the resolution that it will adopt tomorrow, Parliament will welcome the positions taken on credit rating agencies, which aim to increase transparency and to strengthen cooperation between the national supervisory authorities. In this respect, this very day, Europe has shown the way forward. This morning, COREPER adopted the compromise reached between the Member States, the Commission and Parliament At noon today, Parliament, in turn, adopted the compromise by an overwhelming majority of 569 votes to 47. Therefore, the regulation proposed by the Commission and amended by Parliament will quickly come into effect. I would like to stress that this regulation lays the foundations for European supervision in the spirit of the proposals in the de Larosière report. The CESR will be the single entry point for registering agencies and it will initially play a coordinator role. The Commission has undertaken to propose, in the next few months, a legislative initiative that will enable the finishing touches to be put to a truly European supervisory system. Before concluding, I would like to stress that the return of confidence, which is the real objective of all the measures taken, obviously hinges on better regulation, especially of the financial system. However, we must also take into account the fears of our fellow citizens and respond positively to them. We should give them realistic messages of hope. Unless we improve the morale of our fellow citizens, we will not restore consumer confidence, without which economic recovery will not be possible The information provided to our fellow citizens has to be balanced and honest and not encourage defeatism by hiding the progress, the successes and practical consequences of the recovery plans, whilst taking into account the timescales necessary for them to produce their effects.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on rating agencies with which I have been entrusted has been particularly interesting to draft, and I am delighted, above all, that we have been able to reach an agreement with the Council and with the Commission so that this report has a chance of being adopted at first reading. Analysing the various causes of the financial crisis has shown that there was an urgent need to enact legislation on rating agencies. The proposal for a regulation submitted by the Commission has been examined very carefully by Parliament in order to ensure that European legislation is at once exemplary, effective and pragmatic. The recent conclusions of the G20 have further strengthened this determination. The compromise reached by the Commission, the EU Presidency and Parliament adheres to the guidelines sought by Parliament on the essential points of this regulation: the scope, the ratings of third countries, and the prevention of conflicts of interest. Above all, however, I am delighted that this text has been able to lay the foundations for European supervision in the spirit of the findings of the de Larosière group’s report. Indeed, Parliament has kept to the idea that the CESR should be the single point of entry for the registration of agencies. We knew that, given the current state of the law, there was not much more that could be done, but by acting in this way we have laid the foundations for this future European supervision. Over the coming months the Commission will propose a legislative initiative that will enable the guidelines of the de Larosière report to be implemented, so as to create European supervision that is effective and coordinated. As a stop-gap measure, and in anticipation of the Commission’s legislative initiative, the regulation will be overseen under the coordination of the CESR by a college made up of representatives of the competent authorities of the Member States, the legal force of the decisions being guaranteed by the competent authority of the place in which the agency is registered. I should like today to point out how appreciative Parliament was, during the second stage of negotiations, of the very constructive and very cooperative attitude of the Czech Presidency. This has meant that, through intelligent discussion, we have been able to develop a number of rules that should make it possible to guarantee this necessary transparency and to remedy the problems and the shortcomings that have resulted from the absence of legislation on rating agencies. This result is therefore most satisfactory, and for this reason a global amendment reproducing the text on which the Commission, Parliament and the Czech Presidency – that is to say the Member States – have come to an agreement will be presented tomorrow to Parliament. I believe that in this way the European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency will have proved that, when faced with a crisis on an unprecedented scale, the European institutions were very resourceful. I hope that, in the same spirit, we will be able to adopt the other provisions of this financial package, and in particular the recast of the Directive on the capital requirements of banks, also referred to as Basel II. During this period in which Europeans are questioning Europe’s effectiveness, it seems vital to me that we be able to prove that Europe is capable of tackling the crisis.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall limit myself to two or three brief remarks. The first is that there has been fairly broad agreement in this House concerning the report on rating agencies, and, of course, European legislation will evolve over time, but I believe that, for now, it may serve as a model for an international agreement. Finally, allow me to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Klinz, who have worked hard alongside me, the teams from the Commission, the Presidency and, of course, the secretariat of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the experts, without whom this work could not have been concluded so successfully.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of our fellow Member, Mr Toubon. I should like firstly to thank Mr Popa, who has done an excellent job of trying to reach a compromise that is acceptable to us all, despite the extreme positions adopted on this issue by some members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The report raises the important issue of finding a balance between security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet. Indeed, while for many this new technology is synonymous with progress and opportunities, it is not without its risks. For example, it is essential to guarantee freedom of expression and of information on this new medium, while ensuring at the same time that respect is shown for other fundamental freedoms, such as the protection of people’s private lives and of personal data, and for intellectual property. The rapporteur, Mr Lambrinidis, who has done an excellent job, has thus taken into account the new types of Internet crime and the dangers they pose, especially for children. Unfortunately the report remains more ambiguous and even dangerous on other points. The aim of the amendments tabled by Mrs Hieronymi, Mr Mavrommatis and Mr Toubon, is to make it clear that attacks on fundamental freedoms should not be supported in the name of freedom of expression and of information. The Member States and Internet operators should keep some room for manoeuvre so that they can find the best solutions for ensuring that the rights of some do not completely prevent those of others from being exercised. Laws must apply to the Internet as they do everywhere else. The Internet cannot be a virtual space where an act that constitutes an offence in the real world is deemed permissible, and even protected simply by the effect of technology and the way in which it is used. The rule of law in our democratic societies is at stake.
 Jean-Paul Gauzès  (PPE-DE

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in these times of crisis, our fellow citizens are expecting much of Europe. Europe must not let them down. Of course, if we are being realistic, we have to acknowledge that European financial resources are limited, and we need to look at how they can be improved. However, Europe will come more to the fore and will have more success if it shows greater political will. This involves firstly, of course, acting as a catalyst for the actions and efforts of the Member States, but also taking a coordinated approach at European level. The recovery plan is essentially a toolbox to promote restructuring. The role of the EIB must be strengthened. Europe must act to define a clear, innovative economic strategy. Economic operators need prospects and legal stability. It is important, first, to put financial services in order so that the banking institutions can play their main role, which is to finance economic development. The texts currently being prepared for directives on the capital requirements of banks and insurance companies, and the regulations on rating agencies, must contribute to this task. The text on rating agencies must implement the lessons learned from the proven shortcomings. There is an equally urgent need to provide for European supervision of regulated financial activities. The report by the de Larosière group makes some useful and timely proposals that should be implemented quickly. Europe also needs to be given a proper, effective, modern industrial policy. In this respect, we need to reconcile the needs for sustainable development and the requirement for a high-quality industrial base to produce wealth and create employment. In these times of crisis, it is preferable not to hamper those sectors that are operating normally by producing rules or regulations whose effectiveness has not been properly shown. For example, in the automotive sector, which is today experiencing severe difficulties, it is important to extend the regulation exempting vehicle distribution, which expires in 2010. We must also be vigilant, for example, when negotiating the bilateral agreement with Korea, as it could be very conducive to our industry.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, much has just been said about what has become of this Payment Services Directive for which I was Parliament’s rapporteur and which was adopted at first reading in 2007. The purpose of this directive was, among other things, to give the various banking institutions, grouped within the EPC, the legal instruments necessary for the implementation of SEPA. A European regulation has therefore been adopted for bank cards, credit transfers and direct debits. SEPA is an integrated market for payment services in euros where there will be no difference between cross-border payments and national payments. This situation will have benefits both for the banking sector and for consumers. As you said, the Commission has committed itself to ensuring that migration to the SEPA instruments does not result in a more expensive payment system for the citizens of the European Union. Since the adoption of this report, migration to SEPA has progressed very slowly, much too slowly. On 1 October 2008, only 1.7% of transactions were made by way of the SEPA Credit Transfer format. That is why, today, we are approving the European Parliament resolution calling on the Commission to fix an end date for migration to SEPA products. This date must not be later than 31 December 2012, after which date all payments in euros should be made using the SEPA standards. Before this migration can take effect, however, the sensitive problem, the sensitive issue of multilateral interchange fees, needs to be resolved. These fees should not be abolished. Payment services are a commercial activity. It is legitimate to cover costs and keep a profit margin for participants. On the other hand, opacity or arbitrariness should be avoided. It is therefore appropriate for the Commission to lay down guidelines with respect to the application of these interchange fees. In order to have more legal certainty, these guidelines must be known before the SEPA system for direct debits is launched. Without this legal certainty, banks in many countries might not launch the direct debit system, and this could bring implementation of SEPA to a halt. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have tabled very similar amendments along these lines for tomorrow’s vote. Obviously, we hope that they will be taken into consideration.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fear, unfortunately that the message just delivered cannot surely be a message of hope intended to restore confidence. Commissioner, I approved your last but one paragraph on what the car industry should be. Unfortunately, I fear that the proposals made are not up to the mark and in particular they encourage some Member States to manage all alone when Europe is unable to coordinate. What are our fellow citizens expecting today? They are expecting a great deal from Europe, certainly much too much, but they are expecting us to do something else. The car industry, as you said, employs 12 million people in the European Union and is equal to 10% of GDP. In France, that means 2.5 million jobs or 10% of wage and salary earners, and 15% of expenditure on research and development. The car industry today is experiencing an unprecedented crisis characterised by a drop in demand, by a need for finance for manufacturers and subcontractors but also consumers, and by a structural competitive challenge for companies facing ever-increasing competition worldwide. If I did not fear being politically incorrect, I would add that the requirements placed on the car industry and the encouragement not to use vehicles are also contributing to this situation. A coordinated response at European level is essential and urgent to take over and enhance the actions already taken by various governments. It is essential, in the first instance, that the banking system lends normally to the car industry, that is to say at normal rates and conditions and at volumes corresponding to the needs of that industry. Despite the efforts of the EIB, we know that credit still has not started to flow again. Therefore, Europe should make a significant response. Secondly, it is not only a matter of limiting the impact of the crisis but also of providing the car industry with a new future. A genuine industrial policy is essential. We must enter tomorrow’s world and speed up the necessary developments with regard to the protection of the environment and the requirements of sustainable development in particular. We must develop a science-fiction culture. It is imperative that the drive for innovation is not made to the detriment of the crisis and that public aid enables action in this domain.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me first of all to salute the remarkable work accomplished by our rapporteur, Wolf Klinz, who has managed to find broad agreement within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and negotiate a completely satisfactory compromise with the Presidency. The Committee on Legal Affairs, when asked for its opinion, made known its views and these were taken into account. The original UCITS Directive was the key to development for European investment funds. In June 2007, the assets managed in UCITS represented EUR 6 000 billion and UCITS accounted for around 75% of the investment fund market in the European Union. The internal guarantees provided by UCITS explain why they are recognised by investors well beyond Europe’s borders. However, the regulations must change to promote the development of these funds. The changes made in 2001 opened new investment areas for UCITS but they left behind several bottlenecks. The Green Paper led to a public debate. In 2005 it was followed by a White Paper. Today, we can welcome the major advances in efficiency offered by the proposal that we have before us. The most significant progress is the recognition of a European passport for management companies. The proposed provisions will allow the implementation of this passport for management companies, whilst guaranteeing adequate protection for investors. It is a complete passport and we welcome it. The supervision measures it includes will certainly be effective in removing any doubts which might have been expressed. The proposal also makes major technical improvements, for example, notifications, cross-border mergers and the grouping of funds via master-feeder-structures. The harmonisation which will be thus achieved will also guarantee equitable competition conditions across the European Union, provided, as our rapporteur has stated, that actions are taken at a fiscal level to avoid distortions.

 Mr President, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, many good points have already been made. In 10 years, the euro has become a strong symbol for Europe. Yet the idea that Europe could create a single currency, whose foundations were laid especially in the Bremen agreement on the monetary system in 1978 and the creation of the ecu, would have been met at the time with scepticism from the markets and the main monetary authorities outside Europe. We should warmly thank and congratulate all those who made the decision and whose names have been mentioned here. The creation of the euro is the best proof that Europe is capable, given the political will, to take long-term decisions for a common, prosperous future. This anniversary, then, gives us a particularly apt message of hope for today’s times. It must be said, however, that among our fellow citizens and until recently there were mixed perceptions of the euro. For those who travel, the advantage of a single currency was obvious. For those who do not, the euro was associated with price rises. Studies have, in fact, shown that in most countries inflation was felt even though the official figures showed that, due especially to the action of the European Central Bank, monetary stability had been ensured. The reality is that some definitely took advantage of the euro to round up some prices and perhaps consumers were not vigilant enough. When the euro has risen against the dollar, we have also heard comments from some manufacturers who for the most part produce in the euro area but sell outside this area. The European Central Bank has not been without its critics, who have not called into question its independence but rather its policy on interest rates, which seemed to be too high. Today, the crisis has changed many of these perceptions. We all understand that the euro is a determining factor in restricting the European repercussions of a crisis imported from the United States. The European Central Bank has certainly been the most responsive central bank. Its particularly pertinent decisions have been welcomed unanimously. What would the situation have been if the various Member States had each had to defend their own individual currency? Devaluations would have been inevitable and we would not have avoided a currency crisis. The welcome results of the euro must encourage us to continue and to broaden the coordination of economic policies and to respect the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is true, at present, that exceptions may and perhaps should be accepted, but they can only be temporary and the objective of balanced public finances must be retained. High-quality public finances and economic policies are, in fact, in the long run, more than ever necessary. They are the guarantee of effectiveness, competiveness and growth. They are the condition for the solidity of our currency, the euro.

 Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, obviously, our group will vote in favour of the report presented by Mrs van den Burg, and I congratulate her on her work, which is, as we know, always very good. Nonetheless, I should like to draw attention to the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises are not necessarily in favour of abolishing accounting requirements. We receive many letters in this regard telling us to be careful, that simplification is useful but that it ought not to backfire. Let me explain what I mean: accounting needs to be simplified, and that is the meaning of the resolution that states that the Commission has to propose to us, as soon as possible, and, more specifically, by the end of 2009, an accounting framework suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises. That does not mean a total exemption, however. Why? Firstly, because accounting is an opportunity for directors to take stock, at least once a year, of their businesses’ situation. Accounting is also a very useful element in business-to-business lending. It is also what banks ask for in order to grant loans. There are tax obligations. Therefore, let us not deceive the directors of small businesses by telling them that they will save a great deal of time and money if they no longer have any accounts to keep. That will lead to disaster. What we need is an accounting framework to be implemented that is suitable for small businesses and the latter to be relieved of excessive or unnecessary obligations. However, I think the best simplification, Commissioner, would be once and for all to apply the rule that information is to be requested once in each Member State and that businesses are not to be asked periodically to redo the same statements, the same forms, in order to give the authorities information they already have. It is in this way that we can help company directors; by making sure that they have accounting rules suitable for understanding their companies’ situation and that they are relieved of totally pointless administrative tasks.

Mr President, Mrs Dati, Mr Barrot, firstly I should like to commend the efforts of the French Presidency and the efforts that you personally have made, Mrs Dati, to promote a better area of legal freedom and effectiveness for the benefit of our fellow citizens. Our rapporteurs have done an excellent job. That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will endorse these three reports: the Wallis report, the López-Istúriz White report and the Medina Ortega report. For my part I should like to clarify a few things regarding our group’s position on the report by Mr Medina Ortega, with whom I have worked in close collaboration. As you said, Mrs Dati, Mr Barrot, the idea has just been put to us in this report that we should make a considerable effort to mutually recognise authentic acts. There was a debate when this report came out concerning the possibility of an opening with regard to its terminology. For our part we believe that this report concerns the authentic act, the characteristics of which have been laid down by the case-law, and that, at this stage, we should limit ourselves to the authentic acts and not create legal confusion by using inappropriate terms to expand on what ought to constitute an authentic act. You said what the characteristics of the authentic act were, Mrs Dati, Mr Barrot, and I am not going to go back over them. All I would say is that, should debates be opened on other issues, on other acts that are different and that are essentially private agreements, this is not the role of this own-initiative report, which asks the real question today of how we can mutually recognise what the case-law recognises as authentic acts. I should like to thank Mr Medina Ortega once again for the excellent work he has done on this issue.

Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, firstly, with regard to the questions, I would say that they clearly demonstrate Parliament’s desire to be kept informed and to be more involved in the process of reforming the architecture of the financial markets. Parliament is also determined that Europe should speak with one voice, as has been said. With regard to Europe’s economic recovery, concerted and coordinated action is, of course, essential, as has been pointed out. For our part, we support the Commission’s proposal to combine all available European and national political levers in order to combat this crisis. Indeed, the task is now to restore confidence among Europeans and, hence, consumers. We also need to strike the right balance between the long term and the short term. The measures taken in particular with regard to the banking sector are good for combating this financial crisis: an increase of capital, interbank loan guarantees and guarantees for loans. We do, however, need to be vigilant when it comes to actually realising the objective of these measures, that of reinstating the banks to their primary role as suppliers of liquidity and credit – in short, the objective of financing the real economy. The role of the EIB and the EBRD must be strengthened. The EIB’s reserves must be used to strengthen its capital base. The budget structuring is also a step in the right direction. However, words aside, what counts is implementing the planned measures. We must avoid blowing hot and cold. I would mention here State aid with regard to the bank-related programmes. I would also mention here – and you spoke about it just now – the Stability and Growth Pact. We have to realise that our fellow citizens who, in this time of crisis, expect Europe to provide solutions, should not feel that Europe says one thing one day and then the next day does the opposite. Lastly, Minister, on the subject of the regulation on ratings agencies, for which I am rapporteur in this House, we will work diligently to implement an effective and pragmatic system that does not react merely to the current situation but that makes it possible for these agencies to operate on a long-term basis.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this has already been said several times. The automotive industry, directly or indirectly, accounts for 12 million jobs within the European Union. That represents 10% of European GDP. The automotive industry is today facing a serious crisis: the European market has fallen by around 15%. This decline could reach 17% to 20% for the final quarters of 2008. Manufacturers’ results are falling. In this context, the lack of funds is the primary danger facing this industry. Consequently, the manufacturers are cutting production and trying to reduce structural costs. Jobs become the first victims of the crisis. As you said, Mr President, faced with this crisis, what is needed is a coordinated response from Europe and the Member States, especially those directly concerned. The financial support of the EIB that is planned is necessary. Of course, I endorse your proposals. Firstly, we must support investment, particularly for the design and development of clean vehicles and the development of hybrid and electric vehicles. We must also support the market through financial incentives to renew those cars on the road. As the Commissioner said, old cars account for a significant part of the pollution generated by cars as a whole. However, we must also set up a stable and ambitious but realistic regulatory framework. The objectives for reducing CO2
 emissions must be upheld, manufacturers have devoted – and are still devoting – large amounts to this, but realism must plead in favour of restraint in the fines imposed for failing to achieve the objectives. Excessive fines would eliminate general manufacturers. Let us not forget that the automotive industry is the industry hit by the toughest ecological requirements. Finally, in the current circumstances, it would be detrimental to the manufacturers to undermine the protection covering external bodywork parts.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to thank our colleague, Piia-Noora Kauppi, for her excellent report and for her efforts to allow a reasonable solution to be found to the various issues, especially that of the platform. The proposed directive is part of the wider action undertaken to reduce the administrative burden on companies, to reduce the restrictions upon them and increase their competitiveness. We, of course, actively support this objective which will benefit SMEs. We approve the creation of an electronic platform containing all information and the principle of a single fee to cover all of the costs related to the necessary publications. It is appropriate, however, to provide the best possible information and to allow continuation of the usual publication methods, which are still needed, especially in the printed press. The text proposed by the rapporteur after negotiations, and unanimously adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, will allow the Member States to provide for the retention of the usual publication methods, as their cost is included in the single publication fee. We have therefore, Commissioner, complied with the spirit of the proposal by making the platform a requirement and by maintaining the principle of a single fee. We have, however, taken account of the reality in various countries without the IT infrastructure that some other countries have, and which have information habits that should not be ignored. Commissioner, you know that the citizens’ views have to be taken into account and that Europe must not appear to be a source of new restrictions or difficulties. This is why we are looking for the flexibility to take into account the realities of the different Member States, whilst retaining an economical system. You harshly said, Commissioner, that the Committee on Legal Affairs’ proposal undermines the Commission’s position. I do not think this is accurate, nor is it accurate to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs’ proposal introduces new formalities. On the contrary, it is agreed that these are existing formalities which will be retained and we obviously reject the introduction of new formalities. What is needed, Commissioner, I believe, is for Europe to show it is capable of reducing bureaucracy and administrative burdens, whilst respecting national identities.

Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Jouyet for being available and for the great competence he displays in all areas. Europe cannot go on periodically suffering the consequences of crises that are rooted in American capitalism. This has been made quite clear by previous speakers. This position is not one of hostility towards the United States. It stems from an obvious fact: the crisis is the result of serious malfunctioning which requires vigorous remedies. Self-regulation is not enough. Today, however, the crisis is global. Mr Jouyet said earlier that we needed new measures – legislation and regulation – and to assess the balance sheets and solvency of banks, the sovereign wealth funds, salaries, transparency, supervision and accounting standards. All of this should be built upon and improved. It has also been said many times that we need to restore confidence in the financial system, which is an integral part of economic life. I disagree with the criticism that has been voiced and believe that, in this regard, the French Presidency has been quick to react. The proposals put forward by President Sarkozy, speaking on behalf of the European Union, gave a strong signal in New York and the extended G8 meeting he has proposed will allow the world’s various economic players to come together round the table, which is truly a significant step. In order to come up with global rules, we cannot simply settle matters in Europe. Of course, there needs to be progress in Europe and, in this respect, it is unfortunate that there has been some slowness to act. However, rules also need to be adopted internationally. The economy is global, meaning that the rules must also be global. There is a great deal of work ahead of us and I am confident that the measures Mr Jouyet announced earlier will ensure that, over the coming weeks and months, possible solutions are found. It would be foolish to think that these matters can be resolved in a few minutes.

 Madam President, Commissioner, you have shown that you are ready to listen and to pay attention to these issues. However, I would just like to put one question to you and to make a request. The question concerns the manner in which Parliament is to be involved with the work you are proposing to undertake. The request is that if a platform is put in place it seems essential to me that the findings, its findings, should not be decided in advance but should be the product of a true debate and I also think that the members of this platform should be representative of our economic and cultural diversity.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs express the real views of those Members who are interested in this issue. As has been underlined, everyone is aware of the importance of financial accounting standards and of the reforms that have been announced. The time has now come, Commissioner, to clarify and put into action the comments that you have made. I have a suggestion to make: this resolution is a rigorous one and it needs to be, but there is no need to kill the sinner. What we could in fact do is to take a few days respite in order to establish a protocol between the Commission and Parliament that would clearly define the extent to which Parliament has to be kept informed, its level of involvement in this matter and the positions that it takes up, and to this end we need to postpone the vote for a few days. This is the proposal that the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will put forward tomorrow, namely that the vote on the resolution be postponed in order that Parliament and the Commission might be able to cooperate properly on this important subject. Obviously if nothing is forthcoming during this interval, and in order to make up for lost time and the possible lack of information, we shall be obliged to vote on the resolution that is being tabled today, with all the tough decisions that this will entail. In the midst of the difficult circumstances that are now being imposed on us by the current financial crisis, which is not something totally unfamiliar as far as accounting standards are concerned, I hope that everyone of us will understand that we have to find a quick and practical solution that will help steer developments in the required direction.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if European banks are withstanding the current crisis relatively well, it is simply because banking supervision in Europe – while far from perfect – is at least serious. The ongoing work on the Capital Requirements Directive and on Solvency II affords an opportunity for introducing useful measures to improve financial security. It goes without saying that the job of a banker entails taking risks but those risks must be controlled. The important thing for bankers is to know at all times what security they have on a given risk. Certain unregulated financial operators lost sight of that simple principle, and in their case self-regulation will no longer suffice. Derivatives markets have grown increasingly murky, and traders have bought and sold at levels of risk that could not be contained by the management of those institutions that are now most exposed. Recovery from this crisis depends on creating a supervisory system capable of inspiring and re-establishing confidence. There are currently whole swathes of the finance industry that lie beyond the reach of supervisory authorities. Who was supervising the mortgage brokers as they lent so generously to households that would never be capable of repaying? Who was supervising the investment banks that took the crisis up a notch by transforming the bad debt into financial products for sale all over the world? There is a regulatory void out there that is also inhabited by credit enhancers, ratings agencies and hedge funds. It is not acceptable that Europe should periodically have to suffer the consequences of America’s faulty financial system. With regard to hedge funds, the financial ‘police’ in the UK and the USA have just temporarily prohibited speculation on falling asset values, and quite rightly so! The failure of some of these murky operators would accelerate the crisis in the deregulated sector. Not all investment funds are pernicious and some of them are actually necessary, but we cannot permit the continued existence of financial black holes. Reviews are worthwhile and indeed essential but what we need right now is action! That is the thrust of the two reports we are debating.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I simply want to congratulate the rapporteurs and also the Council Presidency on the results achieved at this stage of the debate and preparation of the texts. Many of our citizens question the added value of Europe in their daily lives. As regards justice, any measure to improve this vital public service is likely to improve the perception of Europe’s usefulness in relation to the security of its citizens. In this respect, it is particularly important to ensure that decisions can be enforced across Europe and to remove the barriers to their enforcement within the EU territory. This is the aim of the proposed texts. While respecting public freedoms, these measures will reinforce the effectiveness of penalties ordered by national courts.

Mr President, colleagues, Commissioner, I should like to make just a few observations. I think it is good for our Parliament’s image to show European consumers that we have the protection of their interests in hand. Mr Lechner’s report certainly reflects a tremendous amount of work, on which I congratulate him, but I think that the task now, in the final stage of the process, is to strike a compromise that will enable us to demonstrate the importance that we as parliamentarians ascribe to the consumer. It would be rather hard to swallow if the Council were portrayed at the end of the day as the consumer’s best defender. We need to find a compromise over the few words that divide us, in order to avoid a conciliation procedure which, I believe, would be in no-one’s interest. We also need to avoid taking retrograde steps, and the fact is that consumers in France, like those in Lithuania, are not financially penalised for early repayment. We cannot present consumers with a situation less advantageous than that which they currently enjoy under national legislation.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after a number of amendments, Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs adopted the proposal for a directive on the legal protection of designs or models. I regret that the text adopted makes provision in the short term for the elimination of protection of designs and models of visible car body panels. If this decision is upheld, it will have negative repercussions on car manufacturers in the EU, with no real advantage for consumers. The EU regularly issues reminders as to the decisive role of the protection of intellectual property in business competitiveness. For many years the institutions and the Member States have worked hard to secure Community regulations governing intellectual property rights on the internal market. The current proposal totally contradicts this policy and will do substantial damage to Community protection of intellectual property rights. Protection must not be refused for spare car parts, or for many other complex products which are the result of original artistic creativity and major investment packages. Contrary to what has been claimed, although never established, removing protection for spare car parts would not lead to any gains by consumers. End user gains are not demonstrated by the quality-price ratio. It even emerges in a study requested by the European Commission that full liberalisation of the spare car part market would not necessarily benefit consumers in terms of price, due to the number of intermediaries between the suppliers of spare parts and the end user. Removing protection would actually only benefit economic operators who will not be compelled to cover the costs of creation and who, unlike manufacturers who have to preserve their image, will be less concerned with respecting the characteristics that buyers may expect from the product. The Commission proposal could therefore lead to the emergence of parts of poorer quality, or it could at least encourage forgery. For all these reasons, I regret the position adopted by the Commission. I have stated this and I continue to support the two amendments that I have tabled in plenary, along with fifty of my fellow Members, in favour of a transitional period of eight years to protect designs and models.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, improving the European statistical system is part of the wider task of sound economic governance in the Union, particularly with regard to adjustment of the Stability and Growth Pact. I share the wish expressed by both the Commission and the Member States to enhance the quality of statistical information. As I see it, determining what constitutes an excessive deficit depends on the reliability of the data. Unreliable data puts the entire Stability and Growth Pact in jeopardy. In return for flexibility in implementation of the pact, which was introduced under the reform adopted by the March 2005 European Council, the necessary figures must be indisputable and verifiable. Flexibility is important too in the current context of enlargement of the euro zone. We need to learn the lessons of past experience! The European Union has already been obliged to review the statistics relating to a Member State’s budget deficit and level of debt; now several Member States want to join the euro zone, so the volume of statistical information to be processed will increase, as will the number of parties involved in the discussions. The proposed improvement to the European statistical system aims to address legitimate concerns that have been raised concerning the validity of the data which Member States supply and the system for checking them. We need to take care that doubt is not cast over the entire statistical system and over Eurostat’s ability to verify the budget data which the Member States provide. For these reasons I support the reform, which will result firstly in the establishment of a European Advisory Committee on Community Statistical Information Policy and secondly in the creation of a European Statistical Governance Advisory Board – both bodies capable of actively helping to monitor implementation of the code of conduct throughout the entire European statistical system. I have no hesitation in supporting the proposals made by our two excellent rapporteurs.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the competitiveness of companies and the efficiency of the internal market also require appropriate and up-to-date legal statutes for companies. Some progress has been made in the case of large undertakings, with the adoption of the regulation on the European Private Company Statute on 8 October 2001. In 2004, the European Commission opened up a discussion on a new form of European company, designed more specifically for small and medium-sized undertakings: the European Private Company. That initiative was very warmly welcomed by all those who had been awaiting it for the past 30 years – yes, 30 years. The results of the feasibility study on the Statute by the Commission were presented in December 2005. It clearly showed that the vast majority of the economic operators interviewed wanted such a statute, for two main reasons. Firstly, the introduction of a European statute would have the advantage of removing obstacles to the establishment and mobility of SMEs in the European Union. Secondly, it would enable a European label to be created for SMEs, particularly those in the new Member States. For SMEs, the European Private Company seems an effective way of accessing the European market. Its adoption would also indirectly contribute to the evolution and harmonisation of national law, which, in turn, encourages the development and integration of the European economy. This new statute would meet the need to simplify the legal instruments available to companies and make them more effective. It is my belief that many small and medium-sized undertakings would gain from such a statute, which would, obviously, remain optional. The European Private Company plan is strongly supported in economic circles in virtually all the Member States. That is certainly the case in France and Germany. Parliament has approved the own-initiative report by Mr Lehne, whose conclusions I support, but at the moment no progress is being made. That is why I am supporting the questions to the Commission from Mr Gargani, on behalf of JURI. It is important to know what are the fundamental problems that have caused the Commission to delay its work on this issue.

Madam President, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, ladies and gentlemen, it is neither paradoxical nor contradictory to endorse the conclusions of the excellent reports that have been submitted to us and to support the courageous and determined action of the French Government to carry out the necessary reforms and to promote growth. It is neither paradoxical nor contradictory because France has made a comeback in Europe. By solemnly declaring his commitment to European integration, the President of the French Republic has made a powerful contribution to reviving Europe and to breaking the deadlock that it was in. The agreement that was reached during the Brussels Summit, thanks to the efforts of Chancellor Merkel, is the first practical example of this. One of the aims is to improve the way in which the Eurozone operates. The Stability and Growth Pact, which since 1999 has provided a framework for the budgets of the Eurozone countries and which defines the budgetary discipline that the Member States must apply in order to prevent any excessive deficits from emerging, must be applied systematically, because it helps to establish monetary stability. Quite clearly, France, despite what may have been said, is not calling into question the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, which remain fundamental. However, we need to adhere to its criteria without losing sight of the objective of growth. It must be applied intelligently and dynamically. It is in this spirit that the President of the French Republic was anxious to provide the necessary explanations regarding the ambitious structural reform programme that he is going to implement. The fruitful dialogue that has begun has made it possible to clarify the positions. Mr Sarkozy has confirmed his commitment to do everything possible to meet the objective in 2010, if the boost to growth that he expects from these measures produces the results that he anticipates in terms of tax revenue. France has already committed itself to bringing its government deficit down to 2.4% as from 2007. There will be no let up in the efforts to consolidate the budget in order to reduce the public debt. I am among those who believe that Eurogroup’s role must be strengthened. Equipped with a stable and high-quality president, it must pursue its quest for consistent and coordinated national economic policies. Finally, in this way, with respect shown for the independence of the European Central Bank, Eurogroup will be able usefully to counterbalance the implementation of growth- and employment-oriented economic policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I approve of the European Commission’s priorities regarding financial services policy until 2010. It is indeed necessary to consolidate the progress made towards an integrated European financial market that is open and competitive, and to eliminate the last economically significant obstacles so that capital can circulate freely in all of the European Union, at the lowest possible cost and with an appropriate level of prudential supervision, so as to ensure financial stability. It is also essential to improve cooperation and convergence with regard to supervision in the European Union and to deepen relations with other global financial marketplaces. It seems to me vital to continue the consolidation of the financial services sector, and, more particularly, the integration of retail markets. The more financial markets, which play an important role in the good functioning of modern economies, are integrated, the more effective the distribution of economic resources will be, and the better the economic results will be in the long term. With regard to retail, it is necessary to go further in order to progress integration. We need to consider particularly the issue of harmonisation of national rules for the protection of consumers. Efforts must be followed up. The European Union’s financial services sector conceals a considerable potential for economic growth and employment that has not yet been fully exploited. The internal market for retail services is far from being complete; a more effective risk capital market is essential to promote new and innovative businesses and to strengthen economic growth. With regard to this, I should like to highlight the importance of promoting the competitiveness of European banks in relation to their competitors, particularly the American banks. It is important, finally, to ensure that Community structures are set up in respect of regulation and supervision. The fragmentation of prudential supervision constitutes one of the major obstacles to consolidation of the financial sector. That is why the requirements of cooperation and exchange of information between the supervisory authorities must be strengthened. We should also ensure the security of cooperation in a crisis situation.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, of course, first of all to welcome the excellent report prepared by Mrs Wallis, under the firm authority of Mrs McGuinness. The investigations by the Committee of Inquiry on the crisis of the Equitable Life assurance society have brought to light the harmful consequences of incomplete implementation of European legislation, which was itself insufficiently precise. Policyholders must therefore be compensated for their losses, and procedural obstacles to their compensation must be removed. I agree, therefore, with the report’s conclusions, whereby the British Government is enjoined to assume its responsibilities and devise an appropriate system for compensating the policyholders of Equitable Life in the United Kingdom and abroad. This dismal affair must prompt us to improve insurance legislation so that the consumer retains confidence in insurance products and, more generally, in financial services. Parliament will be able to play its part in protecting investors during the debates on Solvency II. This directive, which will deal with the prudential rules applicable to the insurance sector, must, to this end, put in place early-warning systems for national regulators and for the European regulatory body for insurance. In this kind of directive, Parliament, the Council and the Commission must, as the report recommends, make as little use as possible of the options of exception or derogation or even, if they can, refrain from using them altogether. For their part, the Member States must avoid imposing additional national requirements when transposing Community law and so avoid ending up with excess regulation. The transposition of directives, in the field of insurance as in other fields, should also be better monitored. This means that the Commission must be proactive with regard to monitoring the quality and effectiveness of the transposed legislation. Furthermore, closer collaboration between the European Parliament and the national parliaments would be a real factor for progress in this respect.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report submitted to you is the result of extensive, concerted efforts with the Council of Ministers and the Commission to arrive at a vote at first reading. I therefore call on you to vote in favour. On the other hand, I call on you to reject the amendment to Article 71, which has nothing to do with the draft directive. We are in fact talking here about an issue relating to the retention of data in the SWIFT system, in particular, and, in this regard, I must inform our fellow Members that, during yesterday’s debate, the Commission indicated that it would endeavour to ensure that data are kept secure. I have, incidentally, just received a letter from the German Presidency supporting this position. I would therefore ask you to reject the amendment to Article 71. On the other hand, I am in favour of the oral amendment that will be tabled by Mrs Berès during the vote on the legislative resolution. To conclude, I should like to thank all those who helped draft this report – the committee, the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsmen of the opinion, and all the technical colleagues who assisted me.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 December 2005, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive on payment services within the internal market with the aim of creating a genuine single payments market within the European Union. On my appointment as Parliament rapporteur in January 2006, I thought that, even though some of the Commission’s estimates seemed optimistic, the creation of such a market through the harmonisation of national laws would enable some obstacles to be removed and would impact positively on growth. I therefore approved in principle of the European Commission’s initiative. Furthermore, this proposal for a directive came at the right time to help make a success of the banking sector’s initiative to create a single euro payments area. The objectives declared by the European Commission were to increase competition by creating new participants – you made this point just now, Commissioner – to make the market more transparent for service providers and for users, and to clarify the rights and obligations of users and service providers. In a bid to make this legislative proposal more effective and to take account of the technical constraints of the industry, while maintaining the objective of reducing costs for the benefits of users, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted a number of coordinated amendments, which have at last gained the unanimous approval of the committee members. All throughout the procedure, there have been informal contacts between the representatives of the European Parliament, of the successive presidencies and of the European Commission. These discussions enabled Parliament – which, on this rare occasion, took a stand before the Council had reached an agreement – to have a tangible influence on the negotiations at the Council. I am particularly pleased with our fruitful cooperation with the German Presidency, which has not spared any efforts, and with your Commission. On 27 March 2007, the ministers of finance, gathered together within the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, at last unanimously adopted a general approach on the compromise text. This compromise is, in my opinion, acceptable today. I should like to thank the German Presidency. Its effective work and solid cooperation with the European Parliament have meant that this matter is now on the verge of success. The Council has drawn closer to Parliament on the key points, namely the reduction of the scope to payments in euros or in the other currencies used within the European Union – with there being an option to adjust this after a trial period – the restriction on exercise of the activities of payment institutions to legal persons, the implementation of strict conditions for authorisation to provide payment services, the introduction of initial and ongoing capital, the isolation of funds for hybrid establishments, the limitation of the granting of credit to 12 months with a ban on revolving credit, and the introduction of a provision indicating that the granting of credit must not contradict national and European rules relating, among other things, to consumer credit. There has also been a closer alignment with regard to clearer information for consumers, thanks to a distinction being made between information that must actively be provided and information that must merely be made available to consumers; to the opportunity provided to micro-companies to benefit from the same protection as consumers where information is concerned; and, lastly, to the limited option of derogation, with a maximum volume of transactions fixed at EUR 3 million. The text, as it stands, stipulates a J+1 execution time and the clear division of responsibilities between the various payment service providers in the event of a transaction being poorly executed. It is on this compromise text that Parliament will vote tomorrow. Given the significant progress made at the time of ECOFIN in terms of Parliament’s position and the objective of the parties involved to reach an agreement at first reading, I have tabled just one amendment in plenary, which takes up the ECOFIN compromise. I call on my fellow Members to endorse this amendment. An Amendment 287, on data protection, aimed at amending Article 71, has been tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. I do not believe that this amendment should be adopted by Parliament. On the other hand, it would be helpful, Commissioner – and I am also addressing the representatives of the Presidency and of the Council – if assurances were given, in this regard, to our Parliament. The compromise text is certainly not perfect, and some of my fellow Members will perhaps have the opportunity to say so. It does, however, have the virtue of laying the already solid foundations of an internal payments market. It is important to stress what this advance, which will result in the harmonisation of what are, today, strictly national payment systems, represents. It is worth highlighting the fact that we are not just talking here about cross-border payments, which account for less than 5% of payments, but indeed of all payments that are made. In spite of its obviously technical nature, this text has a definite political scope. It improves relations between consumers and financial payment service providers and contributes to the Lisbon Strategy. However, I should also like to point out that, on this specific and particularly sensitive subject – specific and particularly sensitive because it could give rise to conflicts of interest – Parliament, the diverse institution that it is, has found a solution more quickly than the governments. This is perhaps because we, in this House, have more than elsewhere… (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Hague Convention on securities held with an intermediary is intended in particular, as we have just heard, to determine which legislation is applicable to property aspects resulting from the registration of securities held with an intermediary. This text is far from having found a consensus within the European Union, and this justifies the pertinent questions posed by Mrs Berès. First of all, the Hague Convention respects the autonomous free will of the investor and his intermediary in allowing them to designate the law to which they will be bound in the case of litigation. This is contrary to the law in force in most European countries, which regards the country of location of the securities account as the relevant factor in deciding which law is applicable. In other words, this means that from now on the choice of law would become purely contractual, and this is quite obviously a source of legal uncertainty in this field. Furthermore – and let us not be naïvely optimistic about this - if we take into account the importance of American credit institutions in this field, it is to be feared that from now on the contractual choice of American law will become the norm. This will not occur without causing a certain number of negative consequences. On the one hand, in terms of activities: there is a great risk that the mastery of American law - which United States institutions obviously possess – would work in their favour and give them a competitive advantage over European institutions. On the other hand, in terms of protecting the investor: if, under most European legal systems, the investor and holder of a security has, in fact, rights with regard to the issuer of the security, under American law he only has rights with regard to the intermediary. Hence there are legitimate concerns in the case of the issuer going bankrupt. Finally, the provisions of the Convention are such that, as Mrs Berès has said, they would completely bypass any instruments used to combat money laundering, because these are based upon the principle of territorial attachment. Declarations of suspicion must be made to the national authority concerned, that is to say to the authorities of the country in which the intermediary is based. There is therefore a potential conflict between the law which would apply to the security, a law which might insist upon rules of financial confidentiality on behalf of the account holder, and the obligation to declare suspicions about the intermediary. The European Central Bank has expressed its concerns, particularly about the risk of incompatibility between the prudential and stability rules of the financial system and the provisions of the law chosen by the parties. Moreover, it seems difficult to reconcile the principles of most European countries, under which there is a direct relation between the investor and the issuer of securities, with the principles of Anglo-Saxon law under which there is no direct relation between the issuer of securities and the investor. You said, Mr Barrot, that the process of joining the Hague Convention on securities held with an intermediary was at a standstill: we emphatically want it to stay at a standstill

 Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, the accession of the Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law is certainly a good thing. The Community will thus be able to take an active part in defining the Conference’s priorities and ensure that these fit in well with the Commission’s work programme. There should, however, be no delay in providing for support measures so that the civil judicial area is not weakened but retains its familiar characteristics: enhanced political solidarity within the framework of a community of values, the principle of the mutual recognition of legal decisions and the construction of an integrated internal market. The support measures might include definition by the Council and Parliament of the mandate in matters relating to codecision, production of a legal and economic impact study at the beginning of negotiations and systematic reflection on the appropriateness of inserting disconnection clauses into the draft conventions. Like our rapporteur, whom I congratulate, I consider it necessary for Parliament to be consulted when it comes to the draft conventions and to defining the priorities of the Conference’s work programme. Moreover, the principle must not be that the Community adhere systematically to all the existing conventions. Such adherence to existing conventions needs to be subject to case-by-case examinations by the Council and the European Parliament.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European contract law is certainly such as to favour regulation of the internal market. A legal construction of this kind must, however, be prepared through a transparent and democratic process. The advantages that economic agents are expected to gain in terms of legal certainty and a reduction in the cost of transactions very much depends on the clarity, predictability and stability of the rules. European contract law must be based on the demands of the economic world and on an assessment of its needs. It must do away with those instances in the acquis communautaire
 where there is a lack of coherence when it comes, for example, to consumer rights regarding retraction periods or information provided to the consumer. The draft texts being prepared are, it seems, ambiguous and too detailed and do not really fall in with these objectives. Rather than embark on the utopian road of preparing, at present, a European civil code – a legal 26th regime - would it not be more realistic to prepare model contracts or sector-specific rules? That being the case, the responses to the issues raised by this oral question must permit greater familiarity with the content of the common reference code. Selection of the legal base for an instrument dedicated to contract law must proceed from a political choice regarding the objectives concerned, rather than precede such a choice. It is therefore vital that the Commission clarify the objectives of the work funded since 2003 by the European budget and place the European Parliament in a position to give an opinion on practical proposals. It would be unthinkable to give companies the ability to apply European contract law, as devised by a working party, in place of directives and national rights without Parliament and the Council having approved its content on the basis of a very thorough legal and economic impact assessment.

 Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Wallis on her work on this interim report and on the clarity of her proposals; I would also like to say how much I agree with her proposed approach. I also agree with her on the points that must be examined in the weeks and months ahead. The exercise the Committee of Inquiry is engaged in is not an easy one. It needs first of all to look for the causes of the situation in which Equitable Life policyholders find themselves. In this regard, everything that the motion for a European Parliament resolution asks for and requires must be approved. Much is at stake, and the limits of the exercise need to be all the clearer because of that. As the previous speaker said, we must not lose sight of the fact that this is a parliamentary Committee of Inquiry. It is not a court of law able to hand down decisions on penalties or compensation. The information collected will, at the most, be useful for defending the victims’ interests, furnishing them with evidence that may be used in any proceedings they may take. On the other hand, the results of the investigations may make a crucial contribution to the development of European regulation. They may reveal the inadequacies of the rules laid down or the failings in how they are applied. There will, no doubt, be more general lessons to be drawn by Parliament itself, by the Member States and by the Commission when it comes to regulating and monitoring the decisions that are taken. The work that has begun must therefore be continued accurately, determinedly and dispassionately, and with no ambiguity as to the expected outcome, lest undue expectations again be raised for the victims.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Radwan on the quality of his report in a field that is very technical, but crucial for banking. The draft directive implements or updates the general security principles of the banking system and, in particular, as regards the solvency of credit institutions. Two specific aspects will warrant more in-depth consideration in the future: the division of risks, in order sensibly to control the proportion of regulatory own funds validated by a single signature, and the harmonisation of rules relating to the internal control systems in order to take account of the circumstances of cross-border banking groups. In this respect, I would have liked – and I had tabled amendments to this end – more consideration to have been given to the European dimension where cross-border internal group lending and supervision on a consolidated basis were concerned. I acknowledge, however, that the draft directive, as amended by Parliament, strikes the greatest balance we could realistically envisage at present between the responsibilities of the regulatory authorities in the home country and of those in the host country with regard to banking groups carrying out cross-border activities. In the unfortunate absence of the Constitution, the proposals made by the Council Presidency seem to me pragmatically to preserve the legitimate rights of Parliament. For their part, the banks have, over several years, harnessed human, financial and technical resources in order to keep to the deadline. The statutory deadline must therefore be retained, whatever questions may be asked by the United States. It is important that the directive enter into force on the date scheduled. That is why I hope that Parliament adopts the draft submitted to it and that an agreement is reached at first reading.

 Mr President, I should firstly like to say that I am delighted that, for my first speech in plenary session in this House, there is an esteemed audience present. I also wish to greet Mr Kovács, the new Commissioner-designate for taxation, who is similarly having his baptism of fire today. In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall try not to use up the ten minutes that have been allotted to me. I wonder, for that matter, about the significance of holding such a debate, given that three reports of the same nature have already been adopted and it appears that the political group that requested this debate is not even represented this evening. In the absence of any coordination of national systems of taxation of savings income, some residents of the Member States were able to avoid any form of taxation in their State of residence on interest which they received in another State. Consequently, a directive was drafted to remedy this situation, which is conducive to the development of damaging fiscal competition, as capital tends to flow to countries outside the European Union with abnormally low rates of taxation. The lack of information about this income thus hampers the proper functioning of the single market. In this context, the Council authorised the Commission, by its decision of 16 October 2001, to negotiate appropriate agreements with Switzerland, the United States of America, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino under which those countries would adopt measures equivalent to those to be applied within the Community, so as to ensure effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments. Since then, the Council adopted the directive on taxation of savings income on 3 June 2003, which provides for a system of information exchange. Three Member States (Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg) attached conditions to this abolition of banking secrecy. They secured a transitional period during which they will be authorised to withhold tax instead of exchanging information. In the meantime, agreements have been negotiated with Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino and Monaco. In the case of the United States, the existing framework of bilateral relations with the Member States with regard to taxation makes it possible to conclude that equivalent measures already exist. The agreements between the European Community and Switzerland, Andorra and Liechtenstein were very recently submitted to Parliament and were adopted. The two last agreements to be submitted to Parliament are the agreements with Monaco and San Marino. The content of these two agreements is similar to the content of the agreements that have previously been examined. I shall briefly detail them: withholding of tax at source shared with the State of residence, voluntary disclosure of information at the initiative of the income recipient, a review clause and progress on exchanges of information in cases of tax fraud. These two agreements, like the previous ones, represent a major step forward from the political point of view. The agreements will have the effect of ensuring the adoption by the countries concerned of measures equivalent to those which must be implemented within the European Union to tax effectively savings income in the form of interest payments made in one State and intended for recipients residing in another State. This instrument should permit effective taxation, which is necessary to combat damaging tax competition and help improve the functioning of the single market. In order to attain this objective, the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities provided for by Directive 2003/48/EC is an appropriate means. With these two agreements, the necessary phase of concluding agreements prior to the implementation of the directive for the countries that I mentioned above comes to an end. The implementation of this series of agreements was initially scheduled for 1 January 2005. It was postponed, however, until 1 July 2005 by a Council decision of 19 July 2004, as the various conditions for their implementation ought to be met by then. It is important that this date should be respected in order for the whole package to be implemented properly.

Madam President, my speech will relate to the report on rating agencies, and my first words will be an expression of gratitude to my friend, Mr Gauzès, who has acted competently, lucidly and pragmatically. However, at the risk of straying from the subject somewhat, Madam President, I should like to speak about the problem of the rating of states. In this crisis that we are experiencing, states have become major financial players in the face of the potential collapse of the financial sector. They have taken guarantees, they have debts, they have equity stakes, and that is why I wonder whether the European Union ought not to propose, as part of the new global regulation of capitalism, the creation of a global public state rating agency, an independent body that would come under the International Monetary Fund and would enable citizens to have an idea, via these ratings, of the quality of the finance of states, which, I repeat, have become key financial players.

Mr President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to thank you, Mr Kallas, and your colleagues at the Commission, for the attention you have paid to the parliamentary work linked to the discharge procedure for implementation of the budget of the European Commission and of the executive agencies for 2007. I extend these thanks to the administrative services. I should also like to pay tribute to the huge effort made by the European Court of Auditors under the leadership of its president, Vítor Caldeira. It had limited resources with which to tackle the scale of the task to be accomplished. I would like to say a few words about the context of this discharge. 2007 was the first year of the new 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework in which a number of new rules were implemented. 2007 was also the year of the last discharge procedure of the current Commission, which, at the start of its mandate, had promised – you will recall, Commissioner, it was through your president – to obtain a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors. However, for 14 years the Court has issued a negative statement on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions for the vast majority of spending areas, regarding them, to varying degrees, as being significantly affected by errors, even though – and we should be pleased about this – administrative expenditure and the consolidated accounts are the subject of a positive statement of assurance. Lastly, 2007 was the year of the last discharge vote before the European Parliament elections. In this particular context, and aside from the numerous reservations that appear in the draft resolution concerning the management of Community funds, my aim, in my report, was to try to analyse the discharge procedure and to make a contribution on this difficult path that must lead us to a positive statement of assurance, whilst being fully aware of the limits of the exercise. That is why I am eager to find out what stance the Commission, the political groups and my fellow Members who are due to speak take on this issue. With the work on this matter now completed, I have mixed feelings: on the one hand, I firmly believe that things are improving, but not enough and too slowly, and, on the other, there is the fact that, at the same time, it is untenable to remain in a situation where the European Court of Auditors has not issued a positive statement of assurance for 14 years and where the European Parliament votes on discharge regardless. Europeans are going to end up thinking that Parliament is not performing its monitoring role correctly. That is why I propose that, given the seriousness of the situation, an interinstitutional conference be organised without delay. The latter would involve all those who play a part in the management and monitoring of Community funds, and would be used to start off a comprehensive discussion enabling us to envisage the reforms needed to obtain a positive statement of assurance as soon as possible. I am keen to hear the reasons that are prompting certain political groups to oppose this discussion. Special attention must also be paid to the role of Member States that manage approximately 80% of the Union’s budget. The fact is, it is in this context of shared management that we have the largest number of problems. While I am on this subject, I regret that the Council’s bench is empty; the Czech Republic’s current political difficulties are not enough to explain the Council’s inconsistent political presence, unless we are to interpret this absence and this silence as indifference or, worse still, disinterest. In relation to the report on shared management by the Member States, I would emphasise the role not only of national management declarations, but also of annual summaries, which are so many elements enabling us to progress towards a positive DAS. Furthermore, and pursuant to Article 248 of the Treaty, I propose that cooperation between national audit bodies and the European Court of Auditors be stepped up as regards shared-management controls. I suggest that we examine the possibility of national audit bodies, in their capacity as independent external auditors, and with due regard for international audit standards, issuing national audit certificates for the management of Community funds. These certificates would be submitted to Member States’ governments with a view to being produced during the discharge process in accordance with an appropriate interinstitutional procedure to be introduced. Lastly, Mr President, I should like to point out my astonishment that the consolidated annual accounts were presented with net assets in the region of EUR 58 billion, and I propose that consideration be given to establishing a pension fund in order to externalise the EUR 33.5 billion in commitments to staff. To conclude, I feel that it is time to reform our system, and I sincerely believe that this reform should hinge on an in-depth and sincere dialogue among all those involved with the budget.

Mr President, I believe that the case of Romania and of Bulgaria is worthy of debate, but we really are in an extremely serious situation here. As regards the conclusions, I should like to thank the rapporteurs from the political groups and all of the speakers, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control. I should like to conclude on several issues. Firstly, there is no fraud where the budget is concerned. Secondly, we have many errors, and this is for two reasons. The first is that our regulations are too complex, and so final beneficiaries find it difficult to apply them and commit errors, which are not too serious. The second reason is that the European Court of Auditors applies too low a materiality threshold: 2% to all sectors; as audit methods go, these ones must be re-examined. Thus, it is said that things are going badly, but because we are all responsible. The Commission is responsible because it has not kept its promise, and thank you, Commissioner, for examining the proposals for the next mandate. The Council is responsible because it is losing interest: it is not here. The Member States are responsible because they are not applying the regulations with enough rigour. The European Court of Auditors is responsible because it must reflect on its audit methods, and in particular on the materiality levels; it is the responsibility of the Court, not of the Commission or Parliament, to lay down the materiality thresholds. Parliament is responsible because it must be clear about the current imperfections and must accept the reforms. In short, I believe that we have a series of joint responsibilities. The summary is done at the end of this mandate. Well, we hope and pray that this reform will take place so that we will at last have a positive statement of assurance, in forthcoming financial perspectives. We hope too that if we have a negative statement of assurance, we will have a negative vote from Parliament, so that there is political consistency between the bodies that have to take budgetary control decisions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, my first question concerns the report by the European Investment Bank. I wonder: has the regulation and supervision mission demanded by Parliament been set up? Furthermore, Commissioner, I cannot understand why you do not take the initiative devolved upon you under Article 105 to refer this to the Council, so that such a mission can be undertaken by the European Central Bank. Your answers to me have been very evasive, which I find regrettable. I must also refer to the guarantee issue: I do not understand why the guarantee being granted in this way is not remunerated. Of a total planned guarantee of approximately EUR 30 billion, that would represent a loss of resources of between EUR 30 and 100 million for the Union’s budget. Nor do I understand, Mr President, why the Committee on Budgetary Control, under whose remit European Investment Bank issues fall, has not been referred to for its opinion on this issue of the guarantee granted to the Bank.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kohout, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Ford, for the quality of his report and his sense of compromise. We were able to work on this issue in Papua New Guinea during the Joint Parliamentary Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, and of the European Union. I saw him working with members of national parliaments and I am, therefore, happy about that. I want to join, Commissioner, in the congratulations that have been addressed to you on these Economic Partnership Agreements which have been negotiated with the aim of avoiding any disruption in trade between the ACP States and the European Community. These negotiations resulted in the Interim Partnership Agreement with the Republic of Fiji and Papua New Guinea, the only States in the Pacific regional grouping that have agreed to the provisional agreement, and we recognise the work needed to conclude full regional agreements. This agreement includes all the measures necessary to establish a free trade area. The resolution emphasises that the Economic Partnership Agreement must contribute to strengthening economic growth, regional integration, economic diversification and the alleviation of poverty. It is important to remember that a genuine regional market represents an essential basis for successfully implementing the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement and that regional integration and cooperation are essential for the social and economic development of the Pacific States. This agreement is an opportunity to give new impetus to trade relations and guarantees access to the European market with exemption from customs duties and without quotas for most goods. I should like to insist on the aid of EUR 2 billion to be provided by 2010, and in conclusion, I should like to add that it is very important that there should be no infringement, on the economic level also, of patent rights or of intellectual property rights which affect trade. With regard to human rights, I am amazed that we have dealings with Papua New Guinea when this country still penalises sexual orientations. Finally, on the political front, it is important for us to have an alliance with the ACP States within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.

 Mr President, Mr Špidla, ladies and gentlemen, on 22 December 2008, the President of the Republic of Guinea, Lanzana Conté, died at the age of 74. Over the course of that night of 22 and 23 December, his close relatives were busy making arrangements for the interim period amidst rumours of a coup d’état. At that very moment, were they sincere, those men running a country deemed by Transparency International
 to be one of the most corrupt in the world and relying on a rule of law and a democracy that have never actually existed? At that very moment, were they recalling how, 24 years ago, General Lanzana Conté seized power when the father of independence in 1958, the Marxist President Sékou Touré, died in 1984? At that very moment, were they thinking that a simple officer in charge of fuel procurement for the army would be able to seize power? At that very moment, were they regretting not having worked hard enough to establish true rule of law and real democracy that would have enabled those precious elections to have been organised within 60 days, as laid down by the constitution? If they did indeed have these regrets, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara’s feelings and those of his friends were to change to remorse within a few hours. On Wednesday 24 December, the unknown captain declared himself the President of the Republic, he was cheered by thousands of Guineans and, on 25 December, he made a display of the allegiance offered by the civil government, who agreed to his ultimatum. He promised to fight corruption and to organise elections before 2010. He appointed a decent man as Prime Minister, an Egypt-based international civil servant. He happily reported that nobody in Guinea was condemning him; the opposition political parties, civil society, accepted this situation. Should the coup d’état be condemned in these circumstances? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have to condemn it! The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on behalf of whom I am honoured to speak, condemns this coup d’état although we are not naïve; we know that political solutions are never simple when a country is emerging from a dictatorship. We call on you to vote in favour of the joint resolution of the six political groups.

Mr President, Mrs Yade, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission must protect the European Union’s financial interests, and it shares the responsibility for this with the Member States, under the treaties. The Commission – I regret that its bench is empty – has important powers with which to combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity which undermines the Union’s financial interests. Let us remember that it was the resignation of the Santer Commission, in March 1999, which led to the creation of the Anti-Fraud Office, or OLAF, whose tenth anniversary we will celebrate next year. My excellent colleague, Mrs Gräßle, is right to hold the Council to account on the issue of the long-awaited revision of the 1999 regulation for, since then, provision has been made, on the basis of a Commission assessment due to be performed three years after the creation of the Office, to review this regulation that had to be adapted. Your answer, Mrs Yade, is reassuring. It is a consistent answer. This assessment took place in 2003, and we have a proposal for a regulation. It is now necessary to make a coherent whole of this mechanism, both for internal and external investigations and for OLAF’s general missions. There is the 1999 regulation, number 1073, but we also have the 1996 regulation on spot controls and verifications carried out by the Commission, and that of 1995 on the protection of the Union’s financial interests. The 2005 assessment contained 17 proposals, including the creation of a European prosecutor, since, although OLAF has investigative powers, it is an administration which is uncontrolled by an independent judicial authority. This authority could be both a safeguard for investigated individuals and a support for OLAF itself. What, then, is the true nature of OLAF? Is it an aid to justice, and, if so, to what European criminal justice? Is it a special administrative department? There is a long way to go. Thank you, Mrs Yade, for the impetus you have provided today.

 On the basis of the report by our Belgian fellow Member Mr Deprez, I voted in favour of the draft Council regulation amending the Regulation of 2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, as amended by the Council. Given the need to adopt binding legislation making it obligatory for credit institutions to verify the authenticity of euro notes and coins in circulation, as was emphasised both by national experts and by the Community institutions, we need to take action as a matter of urgency. I support this draft regulation, which requires credit institutions and other related institutions to check the authenticity of the euro notes and coins they receive before putting them back into circulation, in accordance with procedures laid down by the European Central Bank for euro notes and by the Commission for euro coins. It is worth emphasising that the amendments will automatically apply to those Member States that are not in the euro area; this is an excellent point.

 I should firstly like to express how proud I am to be French at the end of the French Presidency of the European Union exercised by France in the person of its President, Nicolas Sarkozy. Whether it be Euro-Mediterranean relations, the war in the Caucasus, efforts to tackle global financial and economic crises or major issues such as regulations (energy/climate package) aimed at having a non-carbon economy for the 21st century, immigration, agriculture, and so on, all of this demonstrates the quality of the French Presidency of the Union and its administration, and the remarkable action of the ministers that have chaired the Council, in particular Jean-Pierre Jouyet. This Presidency is demonstrating, if ever that were needed, how much we need a stable Presidency of the European Union in the light of the global challenges of today, and therefore how much we need the Treaty of Lisbon to be ratified, and I welcome the wisdom of the Heads of State or Government that have reached a good compromise with our Irish friends. I sincerely hope that the Czech Presidency will be equal to Europe’s challenges and will show its commitment to the Union by starting with fully ratifying the Lisbon Treaty in the Czech Republic.

I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Belgian fellow Member, Mr Staes, on the European Court of Auditors’ special report No 8/2007 concerning administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax (VAT). While we should welcome this Court of Auditors’ special report, its conclusions are worrying in many respects, particularly in the light of the observations that Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax is not an effective administrative cooperation tool, given that several Member States are standing in the way of its implementation and that the Commission’s role is limited. It is vital, however, that the Commission starts infringement proceedings against Member States that delay the transfer of information. The Commission’s proposals to amend the VAT Directive and the Regulation on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT are a good thing. I support the creation of a task force made up of the competent Commission services, the Directorate-General for Taxation and the Customs Union, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

 I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by six political groups on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. I agree with the principles according to which it is necessary to prevent irresponsible arms transfers by the strict application of the Code’s criteria to both companies and national armed forces, and to prevent illegal arms trafficking by calling on all Member States that have not yet done so to transpose into their national legislation the 2003 EU common position on the control of arms brokering. We must encourage the conducting of investigations into violations of arms embargoes and improve the quality of the data submitted by the Member States in the context of the Annual Report on the Code of Conduct. That said, let us not be naïve – in this complex and dangerous world in which we live, these subjects are sensitive, and that is why I rose up to oppose the oral amendment tabled by Mr Pflüger. In my eyes it is too quick to make a link between the Code of Conduct, the implementation of the future Directive on intra-Community transfers of defence-related goods, and the control of arms exports.

Having voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by four political groups, including the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the step towards improving the environment for SMEs in Europe – Small Business Act, I should like to pay tribute to the tremendous work accomplished by my French fellow Member, Mrs Fontaine, and by the French Presidency, with Minister Lagarde. There is an urgent need for the Member States to confirm their intention formally to accept the SBA during the European Council of December 2008, to be held in Brussels. This is to ensure that the SBA has the high profile it requires at the same time as its provisions are made legally binding, thereby creating a really positive impact on the environment for SMEs. The latter form the basis of a very substantial part of the economic fabric and unquestionably have a social role to play as human-sized enterprises. However, they are fragile and merit special attention. As part of the interest it must show in its wealth creation system, it is vital that the European Union give its support to SMEs.

 On the basis of the report by my esteemed Spanish colleague, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, I voted in favour of the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions. The Commission must centralise the information relating to actions taken by Member States to combat tax evasion, show which of these were most successful and recommend what measures it deems most appropriate for correcting fraudulent behaviour. The Commission will put together a set of indicators identifying the areas in which the risk of failure to meet tax obligations is greatest. National tax administrations must be motivated by the need to remedy fraud and help honest tax payers to fulfil their obligations. On the basis of the data collected when assessing the application of the regulation, the Commission must draw up a set of indicators to determine to what extent each Member State will collaborate with the Commission and with the other Member States, by providing them with the available information and the help required to correct fraud. The Member States and the Commission must periodically assess the application of the regulation.

 On the basis of the report by my esteemed Spanish colleague, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, I voted in favour of the proposal for a Council directive amending the 2006 Directive on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions. Currently the system for exchanging data on intra-Community goods supplies, which was implemented within the context of the VAT transitional arrangements adopted at the time of the changeover to the internal market, is no longer an adequate means of effectively tackling tax fraud connected with intra-Community transactions. It should be noted that the measure forms part of a range of measures, some of which are explicitly designed to increase the legal certainty of businesses and to reduce their administrative burdens, as well as to significantly improve the exchange of information and the cooperation between tax authorities. I endorsed the amendments in which it is laid down that, two years after the entry into force of the directive, the Commission will have to draft a report assessing the effects of the directive, with special emphasis on the administrative costs that the new obligations entail for the taxpayers concerned and on the degree of effectiveness of these obligations in the context of the fight against tax fraud.

On the basis of Mr Mitchell’s report, I have voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries. I support this initiative providing the European Union with a new development policy instrument to tackle the key problems linked to the rise in food prices that has sparked riots, unrest and instability in several countries, threatening the results of many years of investment in politics, development and peace keeping. Hundreds of millions of people have seen their poverty exacerbated and the recent progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals has been undermined. Faced with the EUR 18 billion needed, the Union plans to fund 10%, that is to say EUR 1.8 billion and, given the funding already available, it is a question of an additional package of EUR 1 billion. I do not agree with the Commission’s plans to draw the finance from funds reserved for agriculture.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, my first words are to thank you, Mr President of the Court, for the immense task you have accomplished with the Court’s auditors; I think this is an important document for our information. As we know, this discharge is the first discharge for the financial perspective 2007-2013. It is the first with the new management, certification and audit control system introduced by the Commission. Finally, it is the last for the period of office coming to a close, because we are starting six months of work and we shall be voting in April before the European elections, at a time when the Commission has promised us a positive statement of assurance. It is now 14 years since we have had a positive statement of assurance, which gives the European Parliament cause for concern. First, as regards the accounts, I am told that this is an unqualified opinion. Why was Galileo not consolidated? And I cannot hide the fact that I shall never get used to accounts with negative equity of 58 billion. That is one of my concerns. So this is good news. We must be glad that, for administrative expenditure, we have a positive opinion, with low error rates and, from what we have been told, no fraud. However, the Member States have poor shared management in agriculture, cohesion and the Structural Funds, where there are too many errors – over 60% sometimes in some Member States. The Council is not here and it would be interesting to know what the Member States and the Council think about this situation, when they do not sign the national declarations and given that, with the present difficulties in public finances, the citizens will be demanding. I think the President is right and we should consider this procedure of discharge with the committees, the Commission, the Council, Parliament, the national parliaments and the national courts of auditors, which are very conspicuous by their absence from this debate. I should like, with your permission Mr President, to take thirty seconds' speaking time as rapporteur to express my astonishment, as my fellow Members have done, at the fact that the Council is absent. However, I have understood, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, that you are to present your report to the Ecofin Council in a few days’ time and that, as a result, the Council cannot express an opinion before there has been an exchange of views between the various Member States. This being so and as the finger is being pointed at the Member States on shared management, I trust we shall receive the Council’s opinion quickly and I shall take the liberty, Mr President of the European Parliament, of requesting a written question at question time asking for a prompt opinion from the Council, once it has been able to have an exchange of views on this excellent report by the European Court of Auditors.

I should like to welcome the important work done by Patrick Gaubert on such a sensitive subject, which is designed to contribute towards efforts to develop a global European immigration policy. Working on a common set of rights for third-country nationals already legally resident in a Member State and on a procedural aspect, namely the granting of a single permit at the end of a single application procedure, had become the logical thing to do.

There was a growing need for public governance of anti-fraud investigative activities by OLAF and independent control of the procedures and duration of enquiries, while guaranteeing the confidentiality of investigations.

 On the basis of the report by the Portuguese Member, Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution amending the proposal for a Council regulation establishing common rules for direct support schemes in favour of farmers within the context of the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes in favour of farmers. To exclude any threat to supplies, in the context of balanced and sustainable land management, it is essential to affirm the concept of food safety. I welcome and support the requests to simplify the procedures. I support the Community’s crisis management instruments. This vote confirms a favourable change in how agriculture is taken into account in Community policies. However, the problem of the future of farming has not been solved: this will be the electoral debate in 2009 and in the political negotiations that will open immediately following the elections.
 Jean-Pierre Audy,  
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. – (FR)
 Mr President, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Mr Juncker, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin by congratulating my fellow Members, Mrs Berès and Mr Langen, on the quality of their report, and by thanking them for having incorporated the amendments tabled by the Committee on International Trade. Ten years on from its creation, the EMU should be regarded as a European success story of which we should be proud. No one can dispute the fact – and many studies demonstrate it – that there is indeed a link between monetary policy and trade policy, and that, in this respect, the positive role of currency stability is necessary for the sustainable growth of international trade. Increased use of the euro as an international currency benefits the Member States of the Euro Zone because it enables European businesses to reduce the exchange risk and to increase their international competitiveness. However, although the European Central Bank, by prioritising price stability, has increased confidence in the euro, no one can seriously dispute the fact that inflation is a global reality and that, in an open market economy, this global phenomenon cannot be tackled by means of European monetary policy alone. It is clear that the euro exchange rates have been too high for too long and have had negative effects, not least by constraining exports and by promoting imports within the internal market. Many manufacturers have voiced their concerns in this regard. According to a study that we commissioned within the Committee on International Trade, the ECB’s high-rate policy has cost us, over the past few years, 0.5 growth rate points per year. It is in this way that I regret that the Commission has not carried out a more precise analysis of the euro’s international role and its repercussions on the internal market with regard to international trade. The monetary policies conducted by some of the EU’s partners with the aim of undervaluing their currency unfairly undermine trade. They could be considered a non-tariff barrier to international trade. It is in this context that we are proposing to study the feasibility of a body for regulating monetary differences on the model of what the States managed to create in the trade sphere at the World Trade Organisation. This body, which would come under the IMF, could help to stabilise the international monetary system, to reduce the risk of abuse and to give the global markets back the confidence they need. I support the Commission’s proposal to develop common, European monetary positions, by obtaining in the long term a single seat for the Euro Zone within the international financial institutions and forums. Lastly, I regret that the report does not take up the idea of an economic government. Mr Juncker, this is not an issue of sincerity; it is a political proposal for organising our Community instruments. In times gone by, governments would settle major international disturbances with military wars. Today, we are fighting an economic and social war, but instead of having people die, we have people out of work, and we no longer really know who the enemy is. In this context, let us not be naïve and let us work tirelessly to implement European economic and social governance. The latter may certainly not be enough in itself, but it is a necessary condition for the success of a European social market economy.

I voted in favour of the resolution on the sections of the EU budget, excluding the European Commission’s budget, on the basis of the report by  Mr Lewandowski. Although none of the budgets covered by this report appear to present any major problems, I remain convinced that the European Parliament is not equipped with the resources to match the political responsibilities it has acquired by virtue of the development of the Treaties and the work of its Members, and, moreover, by virtue of its role in reducing the gap that has set in between European integration and the people, a gap that has been confirmed again and again by the various recent referendums. Like the great majority of my fellow Members, I support the proposal to strengthen the European Court of Auditors’ audit capacity with the creation of 20 posts. The costs associated with funding the extension of the Court building must be kept as low as possible for taxpayers, and it is a good idea to fund this expenditure directly from the budget over four years, rather than to conceal the significantly higher costs that would result from a 25-year rental-purchase option.

I voted in favour of the report by  Mrs Haug on the draft general budget of the European Union for 2009 and amending letter 1/2009 to the preliminary draft general budget (PDB) of the European Union. Like many of my fellow Members, I deplore the fact that the Council has further reduced an already meagre budget: the commitment appropriations of the draft budget represent a total amount of EUR 134 billion, that is to say, a shortfall of EUR 469 million with regard to the PDB, even though the payments stand at EUR 115 billion, this being a decrease of EUR 1.8 billion. The payments are thus limited to 0.89% of GNI, that is to say, an unprecedented level that is drastically widening the gap between commitments and payments and this is something that goes against budgetary discipline. With regard to agriculture, I support the creation of three new funds – the fund for restructuring in the dairy sector, Eco-Aid to maintain sheep and goat farming in the EU, and the ad-hoc financial instrument for the adaptation of the fishing fleet to the economic consequences of the rise in fuel prices.

 I voted in favour of the legislative resolution approving, subject to amendments, the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation of 2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters, based on the report by my German fellow Member, Mrs Gebhardt. In view of the heightened mobility of citizens within the European Union which has led to an increased number of ‘international’ couples, in other words couples where the spouses are of different nationalities or reside in different Member States or in a Member State of which at least one spouse is not a national, and owing to the high divorce rate in the European Union, it was essential to regulate the applicable law and jurisdiction in matrimonial matters which affects a growing number of citizens each year. We should constantly point out that the treaties lay down the progressive establishment of a common area of freedom, security and justice, with measures seeking to promote ‘the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction’.

 I should firstly like to convey to the French Presidency of the European Union exercised by Mr Sarkozy, President of the French Republic, my congratulations on the energy, passion and vision with which he is assuming his mandate. Whether it is a question of war in the Caucasus, which has been prevented, or the action taken to resolve the financial and economic crisis, the Presidency has shown how much we need a strong and united European Union and a stable presidency to champion our values in a world that moves at a rapid pace and that has become much more complex. With regard to the financial crisis and the need for the economy to go on functioning properly, I am in favour of Member States using their financial strength to intervene in order to restore confidence. The Member States use what, in the private sphere, are resources not shown on the balance sheet; in other words, guarantees. It is in this context that I would float the idea of looking into setting up a global public instrument for assessing States. This would be located with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and its governance would be indisputable and independent. Such a global public agency for assessing States would be very useful in terms of ensuring that global finance and the world economy were operating properly and that, therefore, due social progress was also being made.

Faced with the increased mobility of citizens within the European Union resulting in an increase in the number of ‘international’ couples, that is, couples in which the spouses are of different nationalities or reside in different Member States or in a Member State of which at least one of the two is not a national, and due to the high divorce rate in the European Union, it has become indispensable to legislate on the applicable law and competence in matrimonial affairs, which concern an ever increasing number of citizens each year. It is necessary to go on pointing out that the treaties provide for progressively setting up a common area of freedom, security and justice along with measures aimed at furthering the compatibility of applicable rules in the Member States in the area of conflicts between laws and competence.

I regret that, given the development and complexity of the laws and regulations, the Commission has not changed its position dating back to 1st April 1987, which consists of instructing its services to proceed with the codification of legislative documents no later than after their tenth modification, while at the same time stressing that this was a minimum rule and that the services were to codify the laws and regulations for which they were responsible at even shorter intervals. In this particular case, we are proceeding with revision of the directive of 1990 and of the laws and regulations that were changed four times, in 1994, 1998, 2001 and 2003. Initially intended for codification, Directive 90/219/EEC is, in the end, recast in order to introduce the changes necessary for adapting to the procedure on regulations with control introduced in 2006. I consider that the policy of consolidating Community policy should be a priority of the European Commission and that the current situation is not in order, particularly with regard to the Member States and citizens.

I back the compromise amendments aimed at academic excellence, equity linked to geographic coverage, informing the public about this programme and the necessity of lifting all legal and administrative obstacles to exchange programmes between European countries and third countries (problem of visas). I also maintain that it is necessary to take steps within the scope of the programme to ensure that students, doctoral candidates and post-doctoral and university researchers coming from the least developed third countries (ACP = African, the Caribbean and Pacific countries, in particular) return to their country of origin once their stay has expired in order to avoid the ‘brain drain’ phenomenon.

It is regrettable that the efforts deployed by Parliament and the Commission with a view to establishing legally constraining oversight of the European regulatory agencies have produced no significant result. I share the opinion of the vast majority of my colleagues who deplore the absence of a general strategy for setting up agencies in the European Union. It has become urgent and necessary for the Council and the Commission to work together with Parliament in order to establish a clear, common and coherent framework concerning the place given to the agencies in the future within the scope of European governance, its being necessary to set up parliamentary control over the constitution and operation of the regulatory agencies.

 I voted in favour of the resolution following the Commission communication on building a Global Climate Change Alliance between the European Union and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change, and this on the basis of the own-initiative report by my Swedish colleague, Mr Wijkman. It is now established that the least developed countries (LDCs) and the small island developing states (SIDSs) will be hit soonest and hardest by the impact of climate change. These countries have the fewest resources for preparing themselves for these upheavals and for changing their way of life. Climate change is therefore in danger of further delaying achievement of the millennium development objectives (MDOs) in a large number of these countries, and I welcome the Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) that the European Commission proposes should be set up between the EU and poor developing countries most vulnerable to climate change, in particular the LDCs and the SIDSs and ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries. In common with the vast majority of my fellow Members, I consider the budget of EUR 60 million appropriated to this initiative to be not nearly sufficient.

 On the basis of the report by my Belgian fellow Member, Mr Deprez, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution modifying the proposal for a Council framework decision on the European Evidence Warrant for the purpose of obtaining objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters. Like a large number of my fellow Members, I welcome the proposal for a Council framework decision that provides for applying the principle of mutual recognition to a European Warrant for the purpose of obtaining objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters. This European Warrant, hereafter referred to as the European Evidence Warrant, will facilitate faster and more efficient legal cooperation in criminal matters and will replace the current system of mutual legal aid in this area, and this in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council.

 I voted in favour of the legislative resolution approving, subject to amendments, the proposal for a Council regulation amending the regulation of 2000 applying the decision relating to the system of the Communities’ own resources, and this on the basis of the report by my excellent French colleague, former minister Mr Lamassoure. Like the vast majority of  Members, I think it is good to remember that the Council has asked the Commission to carry out a full and thorough analysis of all aspects of the expenditure and resources of the European Union and to send it a report in 2008/2009. In accordance with the interinstitutional agreement of the 17 May 2006 relating to budgetary discipline and sound financial management, I support the fact that Parliament is duly involved with all the phases of the analysis. In this context, everyone should remember that the current financial perspectives for 2007/2013 have been approved within the framework of a political compromise designed to review the correction to the British contribution.

 I voted in favour of the legislative resolution approving, following the consultation procedure, the proposal for a regulation of the Council concerning the application of Article 81 of the Treaty in the air transport sector, and this on the basis of the report by my British fellow Member, Mrs Wallis. This proposal arises from the wish to consolidate Community law, referred to – inappropriately, in my opinion – as codification. I am sorry that, in view of the development and the complexity of the texts, the Commission has not revised its position dating from the 1 April 1987 and consisting of instructing its services to go ahead and codify all legislative acts no later than after their tenth modification while, at the same time, emphasising that this was a minimum rule and that the services were to make efforts to codify the texts for which they were responsible at still shorter intervals. In this particular case, we are consolidating the Council regulation of 1987 and the five texts that modified it in, respectively, 1990, 1992, 1994, 2003 and 2004.

I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my esteemed Slovenian colleague and friend Alojz Peterle in response to the European Commission’s White Paper entitled ‘Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), chronic diseases, strokes and heart disease are steadily overtaking infectious diseases. There is therefore an urgent need to adopt firmer measures in the field of prevention through the widespread introduction of health impact assessments. The fight against the counterfeiting of medicines must be a priority. I regret that the Commission has not examined in detail the problems affecting health professionals, who must be at the heart of any health policy. I agree with the rapporteur that one of the priority goals in the health sector should be a reduction in health inequalities and inequities. I am in favour of a modern approach to health promotion and protection, particularly for the most vulnerable sections of the population, such as young children, and the introduction of integrated social and health policies.

I support the formal request to the Commission to put forward legislative proposals to improve the EU financial services regulatory framework, not only because of the financial crisis but because we will be unable to build a European internal market if we do not have a European regulatory policy. I am sorry that the report does not ask the Commission to apply the procedure laid down in Article 105(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which allows it to propose to the Council that it confer upon the European Central Bank specific tasks concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions. I am strongly in favour of a regulation to strengthen and clarify the status and accountability of the Lamfalussy Level 3 Committees (CESR for securities, CEIOPS for insurance and pensions, and CEBS for banks), giving them legal status commensurate with their duties.

I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Spanish colleague Alejandro Cercas (PSE, ES) on the implementation of social legislation relating to road transport. I agree that it is regrettable that considerable differences still remain in the application and enforcement of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport. We must urge the Member States to step up their efforts to guarantee efficient and uniform implementation of the social provisions and to transpose Directive 2002/15/EC on the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities so as to ensure the road safety of citizens and the health and safety of drivers and to provide a clear framework of fair competition. The European Commission must display the utmost firmness in dealing with infringements of Community law by Member States as regards social provisions in the road transport sector, provide for coercive measures in the event of failure to comply with provisions and take preventive measures, if necessary via judicial process, to ensure strict compliance with Community law. This is essential in order to ensure fair and undistorted competition.

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution tabled by five political groups, including the PPE-DE, on Arctic governance. During the 20th
 century Arctic air temperatures increased by approximately 5°C, which is ten times faster than the observed global mean surface temperature. Indeed, an additional warming of about 4-7°C in the Arctic is predicted for the next 100 years. I strongly support the statement that the time for diagnosis is over and the time for action is now. Moreover, the EU counts amongst its Member States three Arctic nations, and amongst its closely related neighbours participating in the internal market through the Agreement creating the European Economic Area (EEA) a further two Arctic nations, meaning that the EU and its associated states comprise more than half the numeric membership of the Arctic Council. This region plays a key role in the major balances of the planet and I congratulate the authors of this resolution at a time when we are celebrating the International Polar Year.

I share the regrets concerning the absence of any real international dimension to the European Commission’s approach and I support the rapporteur’s proposals that the specificity of the water scarcity and droughts issue requires coordinated action at EU and Member State level as well as at regional and local government level. At least 11% of the population and 17% of the territory of the European Union have been affected by water scarcity, and recent developments have shown that water is likely to become significantly more scarce in Europe. There is an urgent need for the European Union to establish a water policy that enables us to guarantee for the people of Europe, businesses, public bodies, flora and fauna, etc. that we will have sufficient water of an appropriate quality to meet their needs.

 I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague Carlos Carnero González on insertion in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure of a new Rule 202a on the use by Parliament of the symbols of the Union. The three symbols (the flag showing 12 golden stars on a blue background, the anthem based on the ‘Ode to Joy’ from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and the motto ‘United in Diversity’) help to bring the citizens closer to the European Union and to build a European identity that complements our national identities. These symbols have been used for more than 30 years by all of the European institutions and were officially adopted by the European Council in 1985. I am pleased with the choice of 9 May as Europe Day: it commemorates 9 May 1950, when the French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, in his speech in the Salon de l’Horloge at the Quai d’Orsay, outlined publicly Jean Monnet’s idea to bring together coal and steel production under the umbrella of a supranational High Authority, thereby pooling the resources necessary for munitions. At that time, his goal was to prevent another war between France and Germany and to anchor Germany firmly in the Western camp at the beginning of the Cold War.

I voted in favour of and signed the PPE resolution drawn up by my Greek friend and former minister Georgios Papastamkos on the suspension of the Doha Round. These negotiations reached a stalemate in July 2008 and I regret Pascal Lamy’s stubborn insistence on securing, at any cost, an overly ambitious agreement, forgetting that Doha is first and foremost a development round aimed at helping the least advanced and developing countries. This failure adds to the current global economic uncertainty and calls into question the credibility of the WTO, resulting in a shift towards regional and bilateral trade agreements. I am fully committed to the multilateral approach to trade policy and to a WTO able to guarantee a comprehensive and balanced outcome for international trade on the basis of full respect for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. I regret that Commissioner Peter Mandelson was not on the European Commission bench to give an account of his mandate, while recognising the British Government’s urgent need for a member who will distil the European approach, notably for the resolution of the financial crisis.

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament’s resolution of 9 October 2008 tabled by six political groups, including the PPE-DE, on the situation in Belarus after the parliamentary elections of 28 September 2008. The statements by President Alexander Lukashenko had given us some hope: he had publicly called for open and democratic elections on 10 July 2008 and had reiterated this call on television on 29 August 2008, promising that the elections would be unprecedented in terms of fairness. It is unacceptable that, in spite of a few minor improvements, the elections of 28 September 2008 fell short of internationally recognised democratic standards, as confirmed by the OSCE Election Observation Mission. For fear of democracy, the last dictator in Europe wasted an opportunity to join the procession of the magnificent and great historical developments that we have witnessed since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of communism.

It is important to remember that through the committee procedure, the European Union, within the framework of Community law, converts the international accounting standards drawn up by the IASB. In spite of this Community adoption procedure, it is essential to ensure that the IASB functions correctly and the creation of a Monitoring Group is a positive step. This Monitoring Group should reflect the balance of the world’s most significant currency areas, cultural diversity, and the interests of both developed and emerging economies and of international institutions that have accountability requirements before public authorities. The Monitoring Group must play an active role in promoting the transparency of financial reporting and the development and effective functioning of capital markets, as well as avoiding pro-cyclicality, ensuring financial market stability and preventing systemic risk.

I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Gabriele Zimmer on promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, including child poverty, in the European Union. A sizable part of the Union’s population remains socially excluded: 16% of the population lives at risk of income poverty, one in five lives in sub-standard housing, 10% lives in households where nobody works, long-term unemployment is approaching 4% and the proportion of early school leavers is over 15%. Another aspect of social exclusion that is becoming more important is the lack of access to information technologies. Like the vast majority of my fellow Members, I welcome the Commission’s approach to active social inclusion, which must enable people to live in dignity and participate in society and in the labour market. I support the call to the Member States to define minimum income schemes to promote social inclusion and support schemes aimed at lifting people out of poverty and enabling them to lead a dignified life.

I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Italian colleague Pier Antonio Panzeri on stepping up the fight against undeclared work, drawn up on the basis of the communication from the European Commission. It recommends strengthening the fight against the underground economy, which threatens the economy as a whole, leaves workers without any protection, is harmful to consumers and reduces fiscal income, resulting in unfair competition among businesses. It is important to distinguish clearly between criminal or illegal activities and work that is legal but is not declared to the authorities, i.e. that does not comply with the various regulatory constraints, notably the payment of social security contributions and taxes. Naturally the controls needs to be stepped up. However, we must also continue to reduce the burden of taxation on the workforce, in accordance with each country’s situation, by improving the quality of public finances. It is essential to reduce the administrative complexities of the taxation and social welfare systems, which can encourage undeclared work, particularly among the self-employed and small businesses. We must urgently look into setting up a European platform for cooperation between workplace inspectors and other relevant bodies responsible for monitoring and combating fraud.

I voted in favour of the decision to approve a general framework laying down the main aspects of the Commission communication on Europe entitled ‘Communicating Europe in Partnership’. It aims to establish a framework for strengthening the wide-ranging communication elements by encompassing them within a broader structure launched by the White Paper on a European communication policy, which advocates a two-way street, characterised by the active participation of citizens and Plan D (‘Plan D for democracy, dialogue and debate’). It is important to recognise that this communication, launched by the Commission following the failure of the draft Constitutional Treaty to encourage discussion of the relations between the Union’s democratic institutions and its citizens, does not appear to have met its objectives. Plan D is a failure: how can there be democracy without dialogue and dialogue without debate? This clearly does little to bridge the enormous gap that has opened up between the citizens, who no longer understand the meaning of European integration, and the institutions, which have become too opaque and incomprehensible. We can only hope that this new attempt to reach an interinstitutional agreement will enable us to move forward.

 I would first of all like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, for his pragmatic and effective measures, and the excellent work of the French Presidency, represented today by my friend Mr Jouyet. The European Union was formed amid the suffering caused by war. It seems destined to continue amid suffering and crises. These crises – the Caucasus crisis in Georgia, the financial crisis, the failure of the WTO – show how much we need the new-look institutions that the Lisbon Treaty gives us, and particularly a permanent presidency of the EU. On the subject of the financial crisis, the ECB has just decided to cut interest rates, and I welcome this decision. It has finally awakened from its indifference; it should learn a lesson from the failure of its monetary policy, since nothing would be worse than increasing rates again once economic growth returns. There is a growing need for the Commission, based on Article 105(6) of the EC Treaty, to refer the matter to the Council so that it can give the ECB a policy mandate for the prudential supervision of credit institutions with a view to establishing a European banking regulator.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened in amazement to the views of the socialists and communists, who tell us that it is the failure of the system. They obviously have a short memory, they who, in the 20th century, bankrupted every economy in their hands. The problem is global and the solution must therefore be European. Regarding the financial question, Commissioner, I would like to know whether or not you are going to implement Article 105(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, under which the Council may, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, confer on the European Central Bank a task relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions. I believe that, today, citizens consider that is time for us to monitor the arrangements in place for the prudential supervision of financial systems. We cannot build an internal market without a European regulation policy.

 I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Hungarian colleague Mr Szájer containing recommendations to the European Commission on the alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision. For the sake of quality legislation, it is becoming increasingly necessary to delegate to the Commission the development of the non-essential and more technical aspects of the legislation, as well as its prompt adjustment to take account of technological progress and economic change. However, this delegation of powers must be facilitated by giving the legislator the institutional means to scrutinise the exercise of such powers. It should be noted that the current alignment of the acquis
 with the Comitology Decision is still not complete, since there are still legal instruments that provide for implementing measures to which the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be applied. I support – and to my mind this is essential if European democracy is to function properly – the granting of additional resources in the European Parliament for all comitology procedures in preparation for the eventuality that the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, but also during the current transitional period, in order to ensure that every comitology procedure between the three institutions functions satisfactorily.

I share my colleague’s view that an increase in student mobility and the quality of the different educational systems should be a priority of the Bologna Process beyond 2010, which aims to establish a European Area of Higher Education. To encourage student mobility, a whole series of measures needs to be taken since the problem of mobility goes beyond the scope of higher education and concerns the scope of social affairs, finance, immigration and visa policies. Special assistance must be provided to students from disadvantaged groups in society by, for example, proposing inexpensive and decent accommodation. I support the introduction of a single European Student Identification Card in order to facilitate mobility and to enable students to get discounts for accommodation and subsistence, culture and transport.

There is an urgent need to encourage mobility and the learning of foreign languages. However, we should also be promoting excellence in native languages, since this is what enables pupils to acquire other knowledge more easily. All this cooperation will be very useful when the time comes for organising school exchanges (of pupils and teachers), regardless of the level of study, based on the model already used for the Erasmus programme for students.

I support the proposal to open up access for small-scale entrepreneurs to micro-credit, particularly farmers, as a means of increasing food production and providing a sustainable solution to the food crisis. I also welcome the proposal to call on the European Investment Bank to set up a guarantee fund in support of micro-credit and risk hedging schemes that respond closely to the needs of local food producers in the poorer developing countries, but this proposal only makes any sense under a Commission mandate.

 I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution based on the report by my Spanish fellow Member Mrs García Pérez on equality between men and women. More than ever we need to attend to the double dimension of the subject: on the one hand, ensuring equality in all policy areas (gender mainstreaming) and, on the other hand, introducing targeted measures to curb discrimination against women, including awareness-raising campaigns, the exchange of best practice, dialogue with citizens and public-private partnership initiatives. All subjects are important: unequal pay, participation in decision-making, particularly public decisions, the reconciliation of private and professional life, and violence against women. Gender equality is an important cause, for which much has already been done, but it must receive the full attention of the humanist political forces for progress and must be debated everywhere, including in intercultural dialogue.

There are very few estimates of the amount of taxes that go uncollected because of fiscal fraud, which is estimated at around 2-2.5% of GDP. Although taxation is a national responsibility, fiscal fraud is an obstacle to the successful operation of the internal market in that it distorts competition between taxpayers. There is no disputing that the fight against tax fraud has a European dimension because of the globalisation of the economy internationally.

I voted for the report by British Member Jean Lambert on the Dublin system, and I applaud the work done by my friend Patrick Gaubert, who was the rapporteur for our PPE Group. The purpose of the Dublin system is to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application made in the territory of one of the EU Member States, Norway or Iceland. Although, generally speaking, the aims of the Dublin system, in particular the establishment of a clear and viable mechanism for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, have largely been achieved, problems remain with the efficiency of the system and its application in practice, as well as with the cost, which has not been evaluated. All of this shows the urgent need for a European immigration and asylum policy, and I welcome the work done by the current President of the Council with responsibility for this field, my friend Brice Hortefeux, the French Minister for Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Mutually-Supportive Development, who has just chaired the European ministerial conference on the right of asylum on 8 and 9 September 2008 in Paris.

On the basis of the report by Romanian Member Renate Weber, I voted for the European Parliament legislative resolution supporting the initiative of a number of Member States (Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden) to strengthen Eurojust. I support the strengthening of the ‘data protection’ element of the proposal and the fact that the European Parliament is to receive more information so that it is better able to monitor the tasks and duties of Eurojust, which was set up in 2002 as a European Union body with legal personality whose role is to promote and improve coordination and cooperation between the competent judicial authorities in the Member States. It has become clear from Eurojust’s experience that its operational efficiency needs to be improved by ensuring that its National Members have equivalent status. I also support the emergency cell for coordination, the national coordination systems, the partnerships with the other Community security and protection instruments (Europol, Frontex, OLAF), and the possibility for Eurojust to second liaison magistrates to third countries.

 On the basis of the report by my excellent Slovene fellow Member Mihael Brejc, I voted for the legislative resolution approving, at first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards the use of the Visa Information System (VIS) under the Schengen Borders Code. In view of the expectations that Europe’s citizens have when it comes to internal security, I wholeheartedly support the amendments to be made to the Schengen Borders Code in order to guarantee the effective use of the Visa Information System (VIS) at our external borders. The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to establish common rules for the compulsory use of the VIS (i.e. a systematic search using the number of the visa sticker, combined with finger print checks) at the external borders and thereby to continue to develop an integrated border management system in the European Union.

The Council Regulation of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products is supposed to come into force as a mandatory requirement from 1 January 2009. The purpose of this proposal is to postpone the compulsory use of the EU logo pending the design of a new logo in order to help to avoid confusing consumers by changing EU logos within a short time period, and creating an additional financial burden for operators, who would have to change their packaging and print-outs within a very short time frame. It is therefore proposed to postpone the compulsory use of the EU logo until 30 June 2010.

Following the referendum held in Montenegro on 21 May 2006 on the country’s independence, in which a majority (55.4%) voted in favour of an independent Montenegro, the Montenegrin parliament proclaimed Montenegro fully independent under international law on 3 June 2006. Serbia recognised Montenegro’s independence on 5 June 2006, and the Serbian parliament adopted a decision defining Serbia as the successor to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, which was the new name for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia under the terms of the Constitutional Charter of 4 February 2003. It is against this background that I voted for the European Parliament legislative resolution approving, under the consultation procedure, the proposal for a Council decision establishing a separate liability of Montenegro and reducing proportionately the liability of Serbia with regard to the long-term loans granted by the Community to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Jouyet, Mrs Benita Ferrero-Waldner, I must firstly thank my fellow Members who have congratulated the French Presidency of the European Union and welcomed the actions of Nicolas Sarkozy in this difficult conflict between Russia and Georgia. It could take for ever to determine the borders of the former Eastern Roman Empire with, to the west, the Balkans and Kosovo and, to the north, the Caucasus, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. What must guide the European approach is respect for people. I suggest that, given how serious the situation in Georgia has become, an extraordinary meeting of the Committees on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments of the Member States should be envisaged because it is we parliamentarians who represent the people. It is finally becoming clear that the ‘Black Sea Synergy’ introduced at the end of 2007 by the European Commission is not sufficient. It is now urgent for the Union to propose a truly ambitious neighbourhood policy with the countries bordering the Black Sea, starting with an economic free-trade area.

 I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my German colleague Mr von Wogau on space and security. The time has come for a common approach to defend European interests in space. It is becoming increasingly obvious each day that we need space assets in order that the political and diplomatic activities of the European Union may be based on independent, reliable and complete information in support of its policies for conflict prevention, crisis management operations and global security (especially the monitoring of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of transportation), verification of respect for international treaties, monitoring of the transnational smuggling of light weapons and small arms, the protection of critical infrastructure and of the EU’s borders, and civil protection in the event of natural and man-made disasters and crises. Galileo is, in this regard, a cornerstone of the EU’s role in space. This approach should go hand in hand with European defence and with support for the European defence industry, particularly in the aerospace sector.

 I voted against the resolution of the European Parliament asking Italy to stop the census of the Roma on the basis of ethnicity, because this seems premature and I regret the fact that Parliament did not vote in favour of the motion for postponement until September 2008 tabled by my political group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Let us be clear on this: I am of course in favour of the ban on fingerprinting the Roma population, including minors, and using the fingerprints collected, since this would clearly constitute an act of direct discrimination based on race and ethnic origin, prohibited by Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and would also represent an act of discrimination. Nevertheless, I was swayed by the arguments of the Vice-President of the European Commission, my friend Jacques Barrot, since he clearly said that the Commission was closely watching the situation with complete transparency to ensure that Community law was enforced. In all good conscience, I have decided that we should wait for the various responses expected from the Italian Government before taking political initiatives such as the resolution adopted, which could be open to misinterpretation by European citizens.

 I voted in favour of the legislative resolution of the European Parliament of 10 July 2008 on the proposal for a Council Regulation instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Union fishing fleets affected by the economic crisis. One of the main challenges facing the EU fisheries sector remains, in many cases, the structural imbalance between fleet capacity and the resources available. The overcapacity of the EU fleet was estimated a few years ago at around 40%. This overcapacity, combined with the depletion of fishing stocks by decades of overfishing, means that the sector is struggling to withstand external economic pressures such as the sudden rise in fuel prices. I wish that a Community instrument annualising the increase in oil prices had been envisaged so that the internal market had time to react to rising cost prices. I welcome the actions of the French Agriculture and Fisheries Minister, Michel Barnier, who worked hard to achieve this result. Thanks to him, immediate support measures were obtained.

This proposal is aimed at creating the legal basis necessary for the Member States to identify the mandatory biometric identifiers – facial images and 10 fingerprints – of visa applicants and establishing a legal framework for the organisation of Member State consulates in order to implement the Visa Information System (VIS) together with the establishment of Common Application Centres. This would avoid all Member States having to supply their consulates with the equipment necessary to collect biometric data. I support most of the amendments, particularly those on the representation of one Member State by another, security measures regarding external service providers and information campaigns.

 I would first of all like to welcome the European commitment of the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his vision concerning the current challenges facing the Union. I support the political statement that new institutions based on the Lisbon Treaty are essential, and without them it would be irresponsible to envisage further accessions. The Europe of results must take into account the expectations of citizens and show itself to be a solution, not a problem. I support the idea of having a mechanism at the borders that will enable fair and non-distorted competition, taking into account the impact of the environmental measures associated with the issues of energy and climate. The priority of a European legal immigration policy is also a human, economic and social necessity. I would like to congratulate Brice Hortefeux on his excellent work on the European immigration pact. Regarding European defence, the President’s bold positions will enable us to move forward on this difficult issue, particularly by involving soldiers from all the populations, and supporting the emergence of a European arms industry. The President is right to defend the CAP, which has never been more necessary. Finally, I would like to stress the need for better political dialogue with the ECB, in order to have European economic governance that is in line with current global demands.

I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Jutta Haug on the first reflections on the preliminary draft budget (PDB) and mandate for the conciliation, which provides a framework for reflection on the structure of the EU’s future budget. The PDB totals EUR 134 395 billion in commitment appropriations, which corresponds to 1.04% of GNI, an increase of 3.1% compared with 2008, and EUR 116.7 billion in payment appropriations, leaving a margin of EUR 2.6 billion under commitments and EUR 7.4 billion under payments. Given the need for a Europe of results, I cannot understand the low level of payment appropriations. In addition to the priorities, it will be important to ensure that adequate funds are allocated to the cohesion policy, the financing of the European policy for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and external action. Finally, it will be crucial not to forget the major European infrastructures (transport networks, energy, space, water, new technologies, health, etc.), which are regularly under-financed despite the fact that they form the backbone of Europe’s competitiveness within the framework of global economic and social competition.

Pursuant to Article 171 of the EC Treaty, the Community may set up joint undertakings or any other structure necessary for the efficient execution of Community research, technological development and demonstration programmes and will be very likely do so increasingly in the future. It was therefore logical to define a suitable tax framework for these types of undertakings by treating them like international bodies. Moreover, in the context of their accession Bulgaria and Romania, like other new Member States, have been authorised to apply derogations regarding the tax exemption granted to small and medium-sized enterprises and the VAT scheme applicable to the international transport of passengers. For the purposes of transparency and consistency, these exemptions should be incorporated into the VAT Directive.

Given the funding needs, it was important to clarify the existing provisions on Community funds managed by financial intermediaries because the current text is ambiguous about the possibility of continuing to re-invest such funds. Moreover, it seems logical to authorise the European Investment Bank (EIB) to re-invest within the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) the funds reflowing from past operations. As the earlier Regulations did not provide for the possibility of re-investing the funds, the ‘reflows’ are returned to the Community budget. With the proposed amendment, the EIB can be allowed to re-invest such funds in the context of FEMIP until the Commission decides to close the operation.

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, let us show some imagination. All the ideas that seek to limit the maximum rate of VAT, including that proposed by President Sarkozy of France, are worthy enough and should be investigated, and I would like to put forward one of my own. Oil is a fossil fuel with a limited life-span and high oil prices are an irreversible and long-term trend. However, what is causing all the problems, apart from the price hike itself, is the sudden and dramatic way in which huge fluctuations in the global price per barrel of crude oil are affecting our economies. I therefore wonder whether the European Union, without concealing the realities associated with the actual price increase, could not ensure price stability according to an annual cycle so that public budget departments, and especially those run by Member States for their tax systems and those established at local government level, along with companies and businesses that are engaged in contractual relationships tied to the price of oil and, more generally, the ordinary citizens who have to draw up their family budgets could all be better prepared for the major changes taking place in the energy sector without suffering the daily pressures that come from the sudden fluctuations in oil prices that stem from global exchange rates, speculation and the euro/dollar parity. It is against this backdrop, Commissioner, that I propose examining the possibility of creating a Community instrument whose aim would be to guarantee the price of crude oil per barrel in accordance with the generally accepted budget cycle of one year. Such an instrument could use the financial technique of buying and selling options on the world market and would prove useful as a way to combat speculation. In 2005, when the price was 50 dollars a barrel, I asked you for your opinion on the subject, Commissioner Piebalgs, and you replied that this idea was interesting, considering that the Commission did not have the power to control crude oil prices, particularly since the oil market is a global one. I must however be insistent on this point, because such a Community instrument, which would operate as a zero sum game in the long term and require practically no financing whatsoever, would at the very least warrant investigation, not – I repeat – as a means for opposing the laws of the free market to which we are subjected but as a way to control the suddenness with which they are imposed on us and to reduce the impact that increased oil prices have all along the price chain in the sectors concerned. The situation in the fisheries industry, which we will be debating in a moment, is a significant case in point.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to pay tribute to your work and that of your administration on this dossier, which is a credit to the European Union. I also thank my colleagues and my political group for supporting an amendment I tabled concerning the need to pay attention to SMEs, which regard the difficulties in applying import and export procedures as one of the main non-tariff barriers to trade. I do think, however, that we need to go further than the cooperation proposed in the resolution. At a time when the Lisbon Treaty is proposing protection of the citizens as one of the Union’s objectives and the WTO is in big trouble, we need to go further because, as the Commissioner said, the customs statistics are alarming and counterfeiting continues to put our health and safety and our economy at risk. The time has come to go further and to consider unifying customs administrations to a degree that goes far beyond the current cooperation, whose limits are clear today.

I voted in favour of the report by my Finnish colleague Kyösti Virrankoski on the fourth draft amending budget of the European Parliament for 2008. It relates solely to the inclusion in the 2008 budget of the surplus of the 2007 financial year, i.e. EUR 1 528 833 290. For 2007 the difference between the revenue received (EUR 117.4 billion) and the payments made (EUR 112.9 billion) shows a surplus of EUR 4.5 billion, from which must be subtracted the payment appropriations carried over to 2008, i.e. EUR 3.1 billion. To this surplus of EUR 1.4 billion the cancelled EUR 0.2 billion of the appropriations carried over from 2006 to 2007 must be added and the negative balance of monetary exchange of EUR 0.1 billion must be subtracted, giving the 2007 surplus of EUR 1.5 billion. This surplus is primarily due to an under-spending in expenditure of just under EUR 1.6 billion. I am sorry that, instead of being automatically refunded to the Member States, there was no political debate on allocating this surplus, for example, to financing investment in the trans-European transport networks. I still remember the difficulties we encountered when trying to find some EUR 3.5 billion to finance the excellent Galileo project.

This proposal for a regulation conforms to the 2004 guidelines on the role of the GSP for the 10-year period between 2006 and 2015, which introduced a number of new objectives, such as targeting preferences on countries that most need it, enlarging the product coverage of the GSP to products of interest for developing countries, making the graduation system more transparent and stable and introducing a new special incentive scheme to encourage sustainable development and good governance. I fully support the report’s call for the European Parliament to be more closely involved in this GSP policy, which is crucial for the countries that need it and which costs us EUR 3.5 billion each year in loss of customs revenue.

 The defence of the rights and the protection of people who are victims of discrimination must be a priority for the EU, but this can only be effective and useful if it guarantees legal certainty for the persons involved whilst avoiding a disproportionate burden for the economic players targeted. In this sensitive area, it was essential to remain vigilant as regards respect for the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States and to ensure that Parliament adheres strictly to what the legal basis allows. The text as adopted today, whilst satisfactory in certain respects – especially in relation to the fight against discrimination against disabled people – the vague concepts it contains, the legal uncertainties that it maintains and the superfluous requirements that it introduces make it legally impractical and therefore ineffective in its application. Believing as I do that excessive regulation cannot be a solution, I defended the amendment to reject the Commission’s proposal, as existing texts on this issue have not been applied in a number of Member States that are subject to infringement procedures. In these circumstances, since I support the objective of this directive but am partially dissatisfied, I preferred to abstain from the final vote.

 I am delighted with the adoption, by a very large majority, of the draft directive, which is of fundamental importance in the fight against illegal immigration and is essential for the implementation of a common global immigration policy. Illegal employment is the principal source of attraction for those thousands of men and women crossing our borders every day imagining they will find a decent job to feed their families. In reality, they only become the slaves of certain employers who use and abuse their situation of vulnerability and ignorance of their rights in order to exploit them and use them as cheap labour. This directive sends a double signal: one with regard to fraudulent employers who will no longer be able to abuse the situation with impunity, and the other with regard to potential illegal immigrants who will be discouraged by stricter conditions of access to legal employment. The compromise negotiated with the Council is satisfactory and we can only hope for the rapid implementation of this directive by the Member States in order to put an end to this situation of vulnerability suffered by thousands of people in Europe.

 Madam President, this draft directive is of key importance in the fight against illegal immigration and has been essential to the introduction of a common policy on immigration. We are all aware that undeclared work is the main attraction for the thousands of men and women who cross our borders every day in search of a decent job and a way to feed their families. In reality, they often find employers who use and abuse their fragile situation and their ignorance of their rights to exploit them and use them as cheap labour. This is what we know as modern slavery. We must not hide the fact that this phenomenon also involves individuals, be they European citizens or people from third countries, who are working and residing normally, but who fall outside the scope of this directive, as it forms part of the framework of the fight against illegal immigration. It is not a case here of pointing the finger at men and women who are often of good faith yet are victims of dishonest networks or employers. The aim of this text must be precisely to protect these vulnerable people and ensure that their most basic, most fundamental rights are respected; this is precisely the declared objective and ambition of the compromise achieved. We should not tar all employers with the same brush and, of course, we should not treat someone who employs a person in good faith, believing them to be working and residing legally, in the same way as those who seek to exploit the situation of these people. We need to be firm, to send out a clear message. We need courageous provisions that are conscientiously applied. The adoption of this text will indeed send out two clear signals. The first is to employers, to tell them they will be unable to carry on abusing this vulnerable workforce and they will thus be truly dissuaded from recruiting an illegal immigrant. The second signal is to those thousands of would-be illegal immigrants who will be discouraged by the rigorous employment conditions in Europe. My thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and to the rapporteur and, like many, I hope this text will soon be put in place to fight against illegal immigration and, therefore, the promotion of immigration...

The European Parliament has just adopted by a very large majority two reports on the admission of migrant workers into Europe, thereby demonstrating the real capacity of the European Union to introduce specific instruments for the concerted management of economic migrants. The adoption of my report on the single procedure for granting a residence permit and a work permit formally refutes the unfounded accusations of a number of heads of state of Africa and Latin America about a ‘fortress Europe’ which is closed in on itself. This vote in plenary affirms the principle of equal treatment of legal immigrants with European citizens and grants them a set of social and economic rights. These decisions will help to improve their integration; migrant workers do not represent a danger to our job markets. The report on the EU Blue Card will in fact allow graduates and highly qualified immigrants to access the job markets of the countries of the European Union more easily, thanks to more attractive reception conditions. Europe has demonstrated that it is capable of adopting a dignified, solid and open immigration policy.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly happy that our legislative debate today is dealing with legal immigration as this enables us to take part in a debate here that is not focusing on or is no longer focusing on the criminalisation of illegal immigration, but which highlights, rightly, the positive aspects and considerable contribution of legal immigration to our European businesses. It is important, in the current demographic context, to remind Europeans of the significant contribution of immigration to the economic prosperity and development of the European Union. The latest demographic forecasts in our possession reveal major risks concerning the viability of the pension, health and social security schemes. Faced with these situations, the European Union has made a clear choice: to promote a common immigration policy encouraging legal, economic immigration, managed efficiently in line with national market requirements. Therefore, we are debating today two far-reaching, pragmatic legislative texts, which are meant to meet the labour requirements clearly defined by our Member States. By adopting these two texts simultaneously, the European Parliament is sending a clear message of openness, that we must seize upon fully to explain to public opinion, to our fellow citizens, and to third countries the positive things we are doing in terms of immigration. We need not be ashamed of our choices in this matter and we have no need for lessons on this point from third-country leaders who are unable to conduct the appropriate policies to avoid their populations risking their lives to seek better conditions in Europe. To focus on the directive on the single procedure, for which I am the rapporteur, firstly, the proposal creates a one-stop shop system for third-country nationals who want to reside in a Member State country in order to work there. It provides for a single application procedure that is simpler, shorter and faster, both for the employer and for the migrant, the objective being to reduce the bureaucratic procedures and simplify the administrative actions. This procedure and single permit will also facilitate permit validity checks, both for the administration and for employers. Secondly, the draft directive will ensure equal treatment for all third-country nationals in a certain number of areas. Recognising the fundamental social and economic rights of immigrants legally present within the territory of the European Union and of new arrivals will help improve their integration and will therefore lead to better social cohesion. Equal treatment concerns working conditions, health, safety in the workplace, education, vocational training, recognition of qualifications, social security, including health care, the export of pensions paid, access to goods and services and fiscal advantages. Realistic restrictions are indeed planned, but we shall ensure they are not greater than what is planned in the Blue Card. The interests of immigrants must be taken into account and their rights must be protected. In fact, the figures reveal that the unemployment rate amongst immigrants is higher than that of European Union citizens, that they are often in insecure employment and that mastering the language of the host country remains a significant barrier. The two texts proposed by the Commission, and I take this opportunity to applaud their common sense, correspond to our idea of immigration policy: a reasonably firm and humane policy. I would also like to thank the Council and the French Presidency for the exceptional and fairly swift efforts made to pave the way for the rapid adoption of these two perfectly complementary texts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard a number of things ... I shall begin by talking about the debate. The debate was quite interesting. I shall not quote anyone, but will say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has no need for lessons where respect for human rights is concerned. The PPE-DE Group is happy that Europe is able to reach agreement on common instruments relative to managing migratory flows, as it is also happy that Europe is not turning in on itself. We have a migratory policy that is both humane and firm; humane because it rejects the disgraceful living conditions of the illegal immigrants who are living in our countries – we are doing all we can to stop men and women boarding boats and risking their lives – and firm because it condemns the traffickers and rogue bosses. Concerning the Blue Card and the residence permit single procedure, I say to our friend Mr Catania that we need the elite and the others in our countries. As we are on the subject, the rights of legal immigrants will be the same as those of Community citizens, neither more nor less. Europe has no need to redeem itself with respect to others insofar as its migratory policies are concerned. Europe does not consider immigrants as crooks or criminals or as a threat to our security or workforce. They are men, women and children, flesh and blood, seeking a better life on our territory, because at home they have nothing. Our common aim is to help and support them, even if this means encouraging them to stay in their countries. Our migratory policy is dignified, open, perhaps security conscious, but for them, and for us, we can be proud of this policy – as we can take pride tomorrow when voting on these two reports on Europe’s migratory policy.

 I am delighted by Parliament’s support for the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum in the context of the vote on the resolution on the European Council of 15-16 October 2008, for which I voted in favour. The Members have welcomed this initiative of the French Presidency of the EU which proposes a coherent and balanced approach to immigration and which reaffirms the responsible decision of the European Union to promote legal immigration and to seriously combat illegal immigration. This success regarding the global framework for action has been consolidated by the efforts of the French Presidency with a view to the rapid adoption of the proposals for directives currently being negotiated, thereby translating these ambitious statements into tangible actions. In particular, there is the directive on the single procedure and common set of rights, the so-called ‘blue card’ directive on the conditions of entry for highly qualified nationals, and the directive on sanctions against employers of illegally residing nationals. This pact forms an integral part of the path towards a true common immigration and asylum policy which upholds fundamental rights and human dignity, as defended by the European Parliament.

I welcome the adoption by a very large majority of the resolution on the annual debate on progress made in 2007 in the area of freedom, security and justice. It is a text of high quality that forcefully reminds us of the need for the rapid adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, which will strengthen the area of freedom, security and justice by providing for fundamental improvements in regard to the legitimacy and effectiveness of EU action. It also invites the Commission and the Council to define the new priorities of the next multiannual programme for the area of freedom, security and justice for the period 2010-2014. Lastly, it proposes a number of vital measures to be adopted in the area of fundamental rights and citizenship, in regard to border protection and to immigration and asylum. Those are the priorities advocated by our political group and most of them can also be found in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which needs to be implemented on the basis of concrete action.

 I welcome the adoption of Mrs Lambert’s report on the evaluation of the Dublin system. The report rightly recalls that, overall, the objectives of the Dublin system have, to a large extent, been achieved, but that, owing to the lack of precise data, it has not been possible to evaluate the cost of the system. Some concerns remain in terms of both the practical application and the effectiveness of the system. The report opens the debate on the future of the common European asylum policy which was launched in June 2007 with the publication of a Green Paper. The report points out that the following aspects of the system should be clarified or modified: observance of the basic principle of non-refoulement
; applicants must receive all relevant information concerning the Dublin system in a language which they understand and they must have access to legal aid throughout the procedure, they must also have the right to a suspensory appeal against any transfer decision; the criteria for determining the age of minors should be harmonised; mechanisms should be devised for blocking transfers to countries which plainly do not uphold applicants’ rights.

 I am delighted with the adoption of this joint resolution on the situation in China. It is important to continue putting pressure on China before the Olympic Games take place in less than a month. We cannot close our eyes to the serious human rights violations that exist, in contradiction with the pledges made by China itself. The European Parliament has a responsibility to remind China of the public promises it made. It is also important to mention minority rights, the rule of law and the still frequent use of the death penalty. Finally, I wish that some of the more stringent amendments against China had been adopted; I am thinking particularly of petitions to release dissidents and human rights campaigners such as Hu Jia and his wife Zeng Jinyan, reference to the situation in Tibet, which is far from being resolved, and the disproportionate and non-transparent sentences given to demonstrators following the demonstrations this spring.

I am pleased that the Weber report on the Returns Directive has been adopted by a large majority. This vote is the very illustration of the fact that the European Parliament has not given in to the populist and electioneering campaign that was waged against this proposal for a directive, but has instead preferred to take the path of responsibility and pragmatism. Parliament has demonstrated maturity and a sense of conscience in adopting a document that will unquestionably increase the level of protection afforded to third-country nationals living in those Member States where such protection is at the lowest level, or even nonexistent. This vote has the double merit of not undermining those current national provisions that already provide sufficient guarantees – as in the case of France, for example – while at the same time taking those Member States whose systems are the most restrictive and the least protective to a more humane level. This text, which does not concern asylum seekers, is only the first move towards the framing and basic harmonisation of rules on immigration. It should not be taken in isolation but is to be seen as part of the EU’s global policy for the promotion of legal migration, which is something Europe needs.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many organisations and political parties are fuelling an absurd ideological campaign against this text, which they are exploiting and misrepresenting for political ends. With this directive, we are offering people in situations of vulnerability safeguards to ensure that return takes place in full respect for their rights and their dignity. It does not concern the right of asylum, Mr Catania. I get the impression you have not understood this yet. We will not let our citizens think that their representatives are responsible for a text wrongly labelled the ‘Shameful Directive’. We do not need to be ashamed of a text that introduces new safeguards. The real shame is those who are blind and cannot see, or do not want to see, the progress it allows. Do we want to incorporate the principle of voluntary return? Do we want to allow Member States to maintain an unlimited period? Do we want justified decisions? Do we want legal authorities to control the conditions of detention? Do we want free legal aid, and NGOs on hand? Do we want to incorporate the principles of family unity, the best interests of the child, and medical assistance? All texts can be improved, but this directive constitutes progress in comparison to what exists today, where each Member State does what it wants, sometimes unacceptably – is this not so, Mrs Roure and Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert? Ladies and gentlemen, I call upon you to vote for this compromise so as not to give way to the political manipulations of certain people on this text and so as to keep in mind the concrete improvements it brings.

I welcome the adoption of the joint resolution on the ‘Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean’. This resolution rightly highlights the strategic interest of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East for the European Union. Our policy towards these countries must be based on the principles of solidarity, dialogue and cooperation. The Barcelona Process warrants being re-launched today in order to make it as efficient as possible. To this end, the Commission’s initiative is a step in the right direction and has the merit of concentrating on specific regional projects, which will make it possible to provide an effective response to the needs of the citizens of this region. The Commission proposal also recommends the establishment of a Barcelona Process co-presidency, a Joint Permanent Committee and a secretariat, which will help to improve cooperation and dialogue between the various partners. In addition, it states that the main objectives of this policy must continue to be promotion of the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and political pluralism.

This report looks at the progress made in all parts of the world in the area of human rights and assesses the efforts made by the EU to promote human rights in its actions and policies. It rightly underlines the need to improve the consistency of internal and external policies in this area. The report focuses, in particular, on the question of the death penalty, on the fight against all forms of torture, and discrimination and violence against women, and on the need to strengthen the protection of children’s rights. It reiterates the EU’s responsibility to promote the role of civil society in order to make the fight more effective and more pertinent and to strengthen the means envisaged for that purpose.

 Madam President, Commissioner, Jacques, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently examining very significant texts that should lead to a real change and, dare I say, a real evolution in the management of migratory flows. I am thinking in particular of the return directive, the Blue Card directive, the directive on sanctions against employers and the directive on a common set of rights. The current legislative work must be completed as quickly as possible if we want effective results that are visible to our fellow citizens and third-country nationals. We have to send a clear message. As parliamentarians we are giving the question of immigration serious attention and dealing with it head-on. We need to look at the management of our external borders and Frontex’s role in that regard. Frontex was not created to recover drowned bodies in southern Europe. It was not created to recover starving children in Eastern Europe, led by their parents on a never-ending voyage of migration. Frontex has a clear mission: to protect our borders in order to protect our fellow citizens. The Member States must therefore face up to their responsibilities and fulfil their commitments by providing Frontex with all the resources it needs to carry out its missions under the best possible conditions. We have to stop thinking of Frontex as a temporary or isolated measure. It must be able to tackle, and keep up with the pace of, the phenomena that fall within its remit: migration and illegal immigration, organised crime, smugglers, trafficking in all its forms. The Frontex agency must be at the heart of the wider border security project and, in this respect, there must be closer cooperation with the senior authorities responsible for these issues. As usual, it is the overriding principles and the political will that threaten the smooth running of the agency: each Member State must be reminded of its commitment to the principles of responsibility, solidarity and respect. I hope that the Commission and in particular the Council will take our requests and concerns on board and that they do not ruin the success of an agency that we need at European level.

 I welcome the adoption of a joint resolution by all the political groups on Tibet. This text condemns the recent repression in Tibet and follows on from this Parliament’s previous resolutions calling on both parties to engage in dialogue. We also call on the Chinese Government and the supporters of the Dalai Lama to end all violence. The Chinese Government must not misuse the 2008 Olympic Games by arresting dissidents, journalists and human rights activists. We call on the EU Presidency-in-Office to strive to find a common EU position with regard to the attendance of the heads of state or government and the EU High Representative at the Olympic Games opening ceremony, with the option of non-attendance in the event that there is no resumption of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

 I welcome the adoption by a large majority today of the report on an EU strategy for Central Asia. It is essential for the European Union to take a closer interest in these five countries: Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. The report quite rightly calls for differentiation in the EU’s policy towards each country and I cannot but approve the fact that criteria such as the human rights situation in the countries in question and their respect for OSCE commitments are highlighted. The text is also keen to stress the importance of these countries for the EU, both now and in the future, particularly as regards trade and energy. The geopolitical situation of Central Asia is such that cooperation with these countries must be increased, both bilaterally and at EU level. The report calls for reforms of social sectors, health, food security and the fight against corruption to ensure long-term stability, security and prosperity in the region. This is therefore a comprehensive text, defining the spheres of action in which the EU can be of assistance, to give it as much visibility and credibility in the region as possible.

 The resolution voted on today concerning Iran has definite political importance. Iran is central to international concerns and we needed to come back to it. This text deals both with the nuclear issue and with the human rights situation. On both points, we are clear. We cannot accept the development of a military nuclear programme in Iran. The resolution expresses its agreement with and support for the EU’s efforts to arrive at a negotiated long-term settlement for the Iranian nuclear issue and underlines the essential role to be played by the IAEA. It also reaffirms that a solution to the current escalation of the nuclear issue is possible and that military action should not be envisaged. On the other hand, the serious and repeated human rights violations must be firmly denounced. The situation is worrying, in four areas: the death penalty, women’s rights, freedom of expression and the repression of religious minorities. It seems absolutely essential to me not to appear complacent on this subject and the resolution strongly urges the Iranian government to change course in this matter.

The PPE-DE Group’s French delegation welcomes the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012. Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency’s activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully. The majority of the French delegation, following the group line, rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma. They did so not in order to express their opposition to this legitimate and justifiable goal, but because these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency’s thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities. We welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens.

Terrorism has become a greater threat than ever before to the security of all European Union citizens. The EPP-ED Group has therefore made combating terrorism a priority and it had hoped to see the adoption of a resolution to that end. The resolution tabled highlights how hard and how necessary it is to strike the right balance between security and respect for individual freedoms. In our European democracies we certainly do need to ensure that anti-terrorism measures are proportionate to their purpose, so that they do not compromise the personal freedoms of any of our citizens. At the same time, we have to remember that the Union’s primary aim is to defend the right of every European citizen to life and to security, and it pursues that aim by preventing and opposing terrorism. It is unfortunate that a large number of distinctly disproportionate and, in some cases, unjustified provisions have upset the balance in this text. Despite the amendments that our group introduced, the resolution ultimately adopted in plenary reflects neither the spirit nor the letter of our position on this matter, and that is why I voted against it.

After more than five years of negotiations the Council has finally reached agreement on the framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. While we might welcome this breakthrough, we must also regret that it has come at the cost of minimum protection. As Mrs Roure’s report points out, the framework decision establishes only a minimum level of harmonisation, and its effectiveness and scope have been severely limited by the many derogations it includes. Despite the European Parliament’s efforts, when consulted on this text, to give it greater force, the framework decision lacks ambition and will not be enough to tackle the problems we face: combating racism and ensuring that our universal values are shared. This framework decision must be seen as a first step in the process of getting to grips with racism and xenophobia at European level and maximum harmonisation in this field. Despite these shortcomings, I voted for the adoption of this report in the plenary because it is vitally important for the European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, to send out a strong political message in support of fundamental rights.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to take a few moments to express my support, our support, for Commissioner Frattini and to say emphatically to him that the attacks made on him in connection with the issue of Romanies in Italy are absolutely intolerable. We all know the values that the Commissioner is defending, the values associated with the defence of human rights, the values that are those of the European Union, and on these values, Commissioner, you are irreproachable. To return to Euromed, I welcome the convening of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on migration, which is to be held in the Algarve, for it will be the first of its kind, the first to be uniquely devoted to the question of migratory movements in the Euro-Mediterranean area. The subject of migratory movements is a key issue that must be placed at the centre of our dialogue, our partnership and our cooperation with the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean region, continuing on from the conferences of Rabat and Tripoli. This is an area in which the Member States cannot act alone. We need support and cooperation from our partner nations, which are themselves often source countries or transit countries, if our migration policy is to be made more effective. We need to work with them to reach a consensus on the returns policy, to increase the number of agreements on readmission and together to implement a policy of intelligent codevelopment so that nationals from these countries are able to remain in their homeland and contribute towards its growth. The question of migratory movements has a security dimension, but it also has a human dimension that should not be ignored. This is why I would like to see respect for fundamental human rights made one of the themes of the conference. I hope that this meeting will provide an opportunity for open and realistic exchanges, so that together we can find the most appropriate solutions for everyone concerned.

I congratulate the rapporteur on having tabled the resolution on relations between the European Union and Turkey. The motion for a resolution by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is a consensual and balanced document and in it she has sought to cover all the issues relating to this particular problem. On the one hand the resolution congratulates Turkey on having recently held free and fair elections, calls on the Turkish Government to accelerate the process of reform and welcomes its intention to adopt a new civilian constitution. The motion for a resolution further calls for a new political initiative to be launched for a lasting settlement to the Kurdish issue. It also refers to attempts at reaching a settlement to the Cyprus question within the UN framework. On the other hand, and this is in accordance with the position being supported by France, I welcome the fact that the resolution recalls that Turkey’s accession continues to depend on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria and on the EU’s capacity for further integration. For all these reasons I have decided to support the adoption of this resolution at the final vote in plenary. I can only once again express my deep regret that Parliament has not formally called on Turkey to officially recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915.

Mr President, colleagues, I should like to thank Mrs Buitenweg for the work she has done, which is of a high calibre. The report makes a number of fair and balanced points, and the major problems with the Directive’s application are covered thoroughly. It is true that very few of our fellow citizens are clearly aware of their rights in the event of finding themselves the victims of discrimination. So it would seem essential to ensure that the relevant information is more effectively disseminated, particularly as this is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Specifically, I support the idea of granting sufficient resources to the bodies tasked with promoting equality. Theirs is a key role here and, as the report rightly states, it is imperative that they should remain independent. The most worrying point made, however, concerns the failure of certain Member States to transpose the Directive, or to transpose it fully. We absolutely must take steps to ensure that all the Member States enact the laws necessary so that each individual, irrespective of his or her country of residence, can enjoy the essential level of protection. With regard to the most sensitive issue addressed, namely data collection, the report is careful to stipulate that it must be carried out in a manner respectful of personal privacy, and solely for the purpose of detecting forms of discrimination from which minorities may suffer. It must never veer into the dangerous territory of ethnic profiling, but it must ultimately deliver the information required for gauging the extent of the discrimination and producing suitable solutions. When it comes to a principle of such fundamental importance as equality of treatment, Europe cannot be content simply to pay lip service, Europe cannot be content to enact a bare minimum of legislation, and Europe cannot be content to be a mere observer. We do need to be watchful, but it is also up to us to act, to lead the way and to ensure that Europe sets an example: the more we can do that, the less we leave ourselves open to reproach.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was pleased to read recently about the Socialist Group in the European Parliament calling for this morning’s debate not to become an electioneering exercise. What is more, on listening to you this morning I find that your positions are becoming dangerously close to those of my own Group. I agree with Mrs Gruber that Member States can no longer manage immigration by acting independently in their own corner of Europe. I also agree with Mr Moreno that we wish to help countries with a high level of emigration develop so that their citizens are more inclined to stay at home. I am also in agreement with Mr Fava when he says that Europe should take a firm stance towards those employers who unscrupulously exploit their workers. There are those who associate immigration with violence and who claim that immigrants are the cause of all the woes affecting their country. These people do not share the fundamental values of the European Union. Fortunately, there are also those who fight humanely against illegal immigration, which only creates modern-day slaves, and who support legal immigration, which provides economic, cultural and intellectual opportunities for us all. We in this House know one thing: this problem cannot be solved simply by acting at a national level. The only way ahead lies in a concerted European policy. We did not set up Frontex to fish drowned people out of the seas off southern Europe or to gather up children in the eastern territories who have died from hunger and thirst. Frontex is not an impassable frontier, it is a means of preventing the arrival of excessive numbers of immigrants for whom we do not have sufficient welfare and material resources. Controlling our borders is not a technical problem and it is not a military problem: it is a political matter. Like you, I am seeking the most realistic and the most humane solution. As we all know, that is to be found here around the European table, to be agreed between ourselves and those who run the countries that are the main sources of immigration. It is up to us to initiate a new, more effective form of co-development that will provide for an intelligent regulation of migratory flows and the peaceful arrival of immigrants into the European Union. Fellow Members, migrants often do not have any choice over what happens to them, but we do have a choice: we can choose to receive them with concern, dignity and understanding. It is up to us to succeed where others have for so long failed. (Applause)

I welcome the adoption of this report, which presents a balanced and realistic view of the issue of immigration and has achieved a broad consensus, as the rapporteur hoped. The report has come just at the right time when you look at the latest events and see the Member States try, one by one, to adapt their legislation to cope as best they can with the influx of migrants. In reality we all know that the scale of the migration phenomenon exceeds the capability of the countries concerned to control these events individually and that a global and coherent approach is therefore needed at European level, as the report rightly states. The text sets out a number of priorities: combating the trafficking of human beings, respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms when applying measures to prevent illegal immigration, strengthening cooperation with third countries, taking the firm steps that are required to combat illegal employment and, finally, the need for a responsible return policy. For these reasons I supported the adoption of the report during the final vote in plenary.

The report by Elena Valenciano on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries has just been adopted by a large majority and I congratulate the rapporteur on her thorough work. The report rightly states that human rights issues should be addressed within the framework of the overall political dialogue conducted with third countries. In fact, the promotion of human rights is a fundamental part of the EU's external and development policy. I am also pleased that the report calls on the Council and the Commission to streamline the dialogue and consultation procedures. Increased interinstitutional coherence and cooperation would give the EU’s human rights policy more credibility on the international stage. Objective evaluation and monitoring would also be required. Finally, the report emphasises the importance of ensuring the transparency of these dialogues at EU level and enhancing the role of the European Parliament in that regard.

I thank Mrs Roure for her work, her application and her perseverance because, yes, perseverance was needed to keep on demanding that the Council reach an extremely necessary agreement. More than five years of negotiation to reach a proposal for a framework decision on racism and xenophobia: is it really reasonable to have stalled for so long measures that are so fundamental to the lives of our fellow citizens? I should like also to warmly thank the German Presidency for succeeding in breaking the deadlock on this text. The European Union is founded on communities with values, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. By uniting, we have all decided to share those values. Ladies and gentlemen, declarations of good intentions are not much use, if they are not followed up with strong actions. That is why it was necessary to act, to act practically, so that intolerance, in all its forms, should no longer poison our continent. Harmonisation of the legislation of Member States in relation to offences of a racist nature was vital. Henceforth, every Member State will have to make it an imprisonable offence to publicly justify, deny or crudely trivialise crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and I am satisfied about that. Nonetheless, I will not hide from you that my satisfaction is not absolute: yes, the adoption of this text sends a strong signal, especially in this European Year of Equal Opportunities, but I am afraid that its added value may be minimal. In fact derogations are anticipated and flexibility accepted. Therefore, behaviour will be penalised only if it could incite to violence or hatred towards a group of people. How, then, is it tolerable for a revisionist to be able to express his views in some European countries in the name of freedom of expression? Freedom of expression stops when the rights of others are flouted. I completely understand that there are different cultural and legal traditions in our Member States, but the fight against racism must not be the subject of any compromise. Tolerating certain expressions of hatred is, in actual fact, accepting them. Ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives, we shall have to be clear and condemn forcibly these acts of violence. We must remain vigilant because our fight in defence of human rights and for respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from over. I ask you, tomorrow, to vote very broadly in favour of this text. This battle is ours. It is an honour to our European democracies and an honour to our Parliament.

How many corpses will we have to fish out of the Mediterranean Sea before effective solutions are put in place? Let us stop pointing the finger at small countries like Malta that can no longer manage the constant flood of immigrants who are washed up daily on their beaches. This is not the way to fight illegal immigration. There is no barbed wire, no barrier that will stop these men and women, who are prepared to do anything to provide life’s essentials for their families, from crossing the seas. In September 2006, Parliament launched an appeal to Member States and to the Commission in a resolution adopted by all the political groups. We were insisting on the need for strengthening partnerships and dialogues with the countries of origin. We also asked for revision of the Dublin II regulation which puts too heavy a burden on the countries in the South and East of the Union. It is of the utmost urgency to establish a fair mechanism for solidarity and for sharing responsibilities between all the Member States. What is more, we have to recognise the lack of results from Frontex. Genuine political willingness is fundamental if Member States are to give adequate resources to this agency to enable it to function effectively in the future.

 I am happy that Mr Newton Dunn’s own-initiative report has been adopted by a very large majority; for our House is thereby making several recommendations to the Council in respect of the drafting of a strategic concept for combating organised crime. The abolition of internal borders between the Member States belonging to the Schengen area is certainly a major advance for our fellow citizens, but it is also helpful to organised crime, and so the European Union has a particularly important part to play in this area. One fundamental and urgent requirement is that a policy of prevention be implemented and effective instruments put in place. If there is to be greater trust between states, and between their respective police forces in particular, then a great deal of progress needs to be made, and the countries from which we all come need to be pressed to set aside sufficient budgetary resources for their exchange and training programmes. Finally, this House of ours has highlighted the need not only for victim and witness protection schemes to be reinforced, but also for the promotion of campaigns making public opinion more aware of the traffic in human beings. For all these reasons, I have given the rapporteur my backing and have, in the final vote, cast my vote in favour of this report.

The report by Mr Rocard on reforms in the Arab world has just been adopted by a large majority, and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality and balanced approach of his work. This report proposes an innovative EU strategy in relation to the Arab world, based on a balanced partnership, with the aim of encouraging fundamental reforms that will involve changes in the law and the crucial involvement of civil society. The report also has the virtue of pointing out the accommodating approach from which some regimes in this region of the world have benefited. At the same time, it acknowledges the efforts to establish dialogue via the regional integration mechanisms, such as the Barcelona process. Finally, the report places particular emphasis on the need for these States to insist upon the values of tolerance, respect for human rights and democratic principles if they are to guarantee their stability and prosperity. It also highlights the close link that exists between the rise in extremist movements in the political landscape and the economic and social reality prevailing in these States. Being in favour of this new realistic and balanced approach, I supported the adoption of this report during the final vote in plenary.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Vice-Chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, allow me, first of all, to congratulate Mr Coveney not only on the quality and scope of his work, which has culminated in this comprehensive and exhaustive text, but also on the openmindedness that he has demonstrated in order to secure, in this House, the broadest possible consensus on this first-rate text. He has thus agreed to take into consideration and to co-sign almost all of the amendments that I submitted to him in committee, and I thank him for having done so. This text has the virtue of addressing all of the difficult issues and of covering several geographical areas. I particularly support the emphasis placed on the activity of the new UN Human Rights Commission, on the tragic situation in Darfur and on the repeated human rights violations in Russia. With regard to the activity of the European Parliament and, more specifically, of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I believe that we can all be pleased with the constructive work of the report, which has made it possible, for example, for the new financial instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights swiftly to be adopted. Furthermore, I believe that this report is timely in pointing out the crucial interaction between the internal and external dimensions of Europe’s human rights policy. Now more than ever, each of our Member States must serve as an example in this matter. Our responsibility and our credibility outside Europe depend on it. I welcome, in this regard, the adoption, last week, by the justice ministers, of the decision on common criminal sanctions against racism and revisionism. Once again, I congratulate the rapporteur on this text and offer him my full support.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for my political group in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Catania, with whom we have worked effectively and fruitfully throughout this procedure. Sporting fixtures are there to attract a large, family-oriented public, which legitimately aspires to watch matches in complete peace and security. The fact is, for years and even very recently, certain individuals have been using football grounds for the purposes of staging violent or racist demonstrations. Such abuses are totally unacceptable. Football is the most popular sport in the world. In order to prevent these kinds of incidents, the Member States have had an organised and effective system in place since 2002 to exchange information on the risks represented by certain matches, and especially by certain dangerous supporters. A single, direct point of contact has been designated in each of our Member States. These national ‘football’ information points meticulously prepare for international matches by improving police cooperation among the services. They therefore need to improve their information exchanges even more and use, for example, standardised forms. These points of contact will thus be able to work in a more structured and more professional fashion. I should also like to congratulate Mr Belet on having included in his comprehensive report several paragraphs on the fight against racism. That seems particularly crucial to me, in view of the rise in all forms of intolerance within our society. Football can in fact only continue to play a social and educational role if matches take place without violence. Ladies and gentlemen, in a few hours’ time, Mr Belet, Mr Bennahmias, Mrs Hazan, Mr Bono and myself will submit a written statement on the fight against all forms of trafficking in, and exploitation of, children in football. I call on you to support us in this undertaking and to sign this text as soon as possible.

Ever since the hostilities were launched in February 2003, Darfur, one of the poorest regions in Sudan, has been the scene of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. There have been four years of conflict and suffering for the people of Darfur, and four resolutions by our Parliament to show our indignation, but the situation remains extremely worrying. Today, our Parliament is reiterating its concerns within the context of a joint resolution on Darfur and is urging the United Nations, the Member States, the Council and the Commission to assume their responsibilities and to clearly set a date for the deployment of a peacekeeping force, under UN control, with the aim of immediately making the humanitarian corridors more secure and of thus easing the immense distress faced by the people of Darfur. I welcome this new initiative, but faced with the urgency of the situation, Europe can no longer just reiterate old requests. Our responsibility and our credibility require us to provide a satisfactory solution to the suffering of millions of human victims whom Europe can no longer merely observe, and to adopt a resolution that finally matches our indignation.

 The own-initiative report on the Seventh and Eighth Annual Reports by the Council on the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports has just been adopted by a large majority. I congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work and on the consensus obtained on this document. This report is careful to point out the need to adopt the Code of Conduct as a common position with a view to enhancing its legal effects on the control of arms exports and to harmonising national legislation on the subject. In the same way, it invites the European Union and its Member States to support the adoption of an International Treaty on Arms Exports under the aegis of the United Nations – something that I think would be useful. It also offers some necessary clarifications of the content and scope of the Code of Conduct and rightly proposes that respect for human rights should become a general criterion governing arms exports. Now more than ever, the European Union must do all it can to appear as a responsible global player, recognised for its efforts to combat the proliferation of arms, which is the source of many conflicts and of serious human rights violations.

Closely linked as it is to the ambition to build a European Union that gathers together the nations, intercultural dialogue today represents an important dimension of numerous Community policies and instruments. That is why I welcome the adoption at second reading of the decision to implement a European Year 2008, which will be dedicated to intercultural dialogue. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at first reading, I hope that this European Year will enable all Europeans, particularly young people, to become aware of the need for intercultural dialogue in their everyday lives. It must highlight best practice in this field, with the specific aim of integrating immigrants, and should do so by continuing the actions undertaken in 2007 during the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Thus, the promotion of intercultural dialogue should continue within the European Union far beyond 2008, as the adopted text calls for.

I should like to congratulate Mrs Bauer on this very high-quality report. Its unanimous adoption within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs testifies to its quality. The report is timely in pointing out that the international trade in human beings affects between 600 000 and 800 000 men, women and children each year. Around 80% of these victims are women and 50% are young girls. The majority of the victims of this trade are sexually exploited for commercial gain. In order to deal with the growth in this form of trafficking and with its increasingly international character, this report proposes a series of integrated measures to be taken at European level, which I feel are equal to the challenges associated with this scourge. Above all, it highlights the EU’s desire to follow an approach focused on human rights and on the victims, which I feel is crucial. For these reasons and because the fight to uphold human dignity deserves our full support, I voted in favour of this text proposing the adoption of a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on fighting trafficking in human beings.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Syria is a country that cannot be ignored in the context of the Middle East crisis. Breaking off all dialogue means isolating the country and carries the risk of the regime becoming more radical. It means pushing Syria even further into the arms of Iran, whose only aspiration is to destroy Israel and to destabilise the region. If we are to resume talks with Syria now, though, we must be very cautious and lay down firm conditions in advance. We must demand that Syria respect Lebanon's sovereignty and that it comply with the Security Council resolutions calling on it to step up controls at the Lebanese-Syrian border and to stop supplying weapons to Hezbollah. We must make respect for human rights and civil liberties a prerequisite for the signing of any agreement. We must demand that it take concrete action in following up the conclusions of the investigation into the assassination of the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. I would point out that this is also a prerequisite for the continuation of the negotiations. Finally, it must clearly outline to the international community the measures that it is taking to effectively and practically combat the proliferation of weapons and terrorism in the region. By that, I mean that it must also stop all support to the Hezbollah and Hamas militias. If the European Union plans to re-open negotiations with Syria, it must do so only if the latter accepts and respects these conditions. Today, conditions for the signing of any association agreement have not been met, which is something that I deplore. We must call on Syria to abandon its closed-shop mentality and confront this country with its responsibilities in a region in which all of the actors must work on establishing peace and stability.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, more than 20 000 illegal immigrants have, at peril to their lives, run their boats onto the beaches of the Canary Islands, Lampedusa and Malta since the beginning of the year. We do not know how many others have actually drowned. As for what Mr Le Pen said a few moments ago about these men and women, it was pretty disgusting. Our sole aim where these immigrants are concerned is to provide for the vital needs of their families. The men concerned, who are often responsible for families, are prepared to do anything to enable their children to eat, and nothing will stop them. Rather than stigmatise these people, we need to put an end to these human tragedies. Let us, then, turn our words into actions and put a genuine immigration policy in place quickly. During the visits made by colleagues and myself to the detention centres on Europe’s southern borders, we sounded a warning note. This summer, a delegation from the Frontex agency was sent out to patrol the Spanish and African coastlines. That was a positive first step. Unfortunately, there is still a glaring lack of resources. Here are a few examples of what might be done, referred to in my group’s resolution. Firstly, increase security at our external borders. Let us remember that, in our Schengen area, it is crucial to share responsibilities and the financial burden. Let us therefore consider creating effective joint patrols for the maritime borders, a European border police force or a network of immigration liaison officers. Secondly, let there be a more effective crackdown on traffickers in human beings and on undeclared work in all the Member States. Thirdly, there should be real partnerships and readmission agreements with countries of origin. To start with, we want the European return directive to be adopted as soon as possible. With regard to co-development, let us put more effective monitoring systems in place. Co-development money must reach the people directly, without being misappropriated. Development aid must be provided only in proportion to the efforts made by countries of origin to prevent their populations from emigrating illegally. Finally, have those Member States that have regularised the status of huge numbers of their illegal immigrants in recent years got on top of illegal immigration in their countries? The answer is, unfortunately, no. Mass regularisation is not, as some people think, the right solution. To conclude, I would quite candidly ask you how long it is going to take and how many meetings are going to be necessary before the 25 … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as two Sudanese survivors told me, we need to break the silence suffered by the victims of the genocide. It is on behalf of these silent victims of the genocide under way in Darfur that I have taken the floor today to direct an urgent appeal – a cry of distress – to you. It is not only an MEP, but also the chairman of an international NGO that is very involved in Darfur, who is addressing you. I belong to a generation that vowed that, after the Holocaust, there would never again be anything like it. The words ‘never again’ are uttered repeatedly, but here we are again having to talk about this issue. Are we going to wait until all of the populations have been exterminated before we mourn for them? How many people need to die before we intervene? Is there a minimum threshold of people who need to be sent to concentration camps before we intervene? In fact, I believe that there are some victims that will never be very popular. Darfur is one of them. Mr Annan declared that Darfur was hell. Yet, it is impossible to imagine just how hellish it is for the populations tortured by the genocidal militias that are in the pay of an illegitimate government. Are we going to add to what is a crime in itself the crime of indifference? No! The torturers need to know that we will not leave them alone because we cannot say that we were unaware of what was going on. We are aware, but we are not taking action. Europe has a powerful role to play. Europe must put real pressure on and show itself to be more offensive in demanding an end to the atrocities and the massacres and in demanding the deployment of the United Nations forces in order to protect the civilian populations in Darfur. This can only be achieved by means of diplomatic efforts and very strong international involvement. For once, the army can intervene in a positive way in order to come between the murderers and the murdered. We must demand a solution to the militias and we must call for the delivery of humanitarian aid. As a number of my fellow Members before me have said, let us waste no time, for we are actually witnessing the first genocide of the 21st century.

In my speech of 6 September in plenary, I appealed for a balanced assessment of the situation before, during and after the Israeli-Lebanese conflict, of its consequences for the populations concerned and of the future of that region. The joint motion for a resolution does not seem to me to respond to this concern for balance in view, among other things, of recitals A and B, and of paragraphs 17, 20 and 25. I therefore voted against this resolution.

Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, fellow Members, on the issue of the way in which we deal with the Middle East conflict, a number of representatives of the European institutions have recently appealed for a structured and overall solution to the region’s problems. Mr Brok recently stated that one of the keys to lasting peace in Lebanon was the disarmament of Hezbollah and the monitoring of the Syrian-Lebanese border with a view to stopping the traffic in arms. Finally, one of my eminent fellow Members said that we were not the Red Cross and that we were to play a positive political role. I agree with all that. Indeed, no overall solution can seriously be envisaged without returning to the issue that, since 1948, has been at the source of all the conflicts that have caused blood baths in this region. By this, I mean the refusal to recognise Israel’s right to exist. It is vital to bear that in mind or otherwise be in danger of confusing cause and consequence. Today, it is Iran, together with Syria – its go-between – and Hezbollah – its military wing – that carry this message of hatred, throwing in the face of the international community their desire to wipe a sovereign state and its people from the world map. We have a duty as human beings to relieve the misfortune of populations taken hostage by Hezbollah’s terrorist action. Our commitment must be balanced if we are to play the positive political role that falls to us. Balance does not lie in unilaterally and systematically stigmatising a single party to the conflict, in the event Israel. Balance necessarily involves having the warmongers, Syria and Iran, confront their international responsibilities. We owe it to two states, Lebanon and Israel - with which we have friendly relations - and we owe it to two peoples, those of Israel and Lebanon, who are our friends and who aspire only to live in peace. I would therefore express the wish that the parliamentary mission that will soon visit the region should carry with it this concern for balance and be able to contribute actively to seeking a peaceful solution between people of good will in the region, so affirming our intransigence towards intolerance and messages of hatred while, at the same time, displaying what binds us together as human beings.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of immigrants are losing their lives trying to reach our European continent. Ceuta, Melilla, the Canaries, Lampedusa and Malta have become tragic symbols in the task of managing migratory flows, particularly from the South of the world. Since Monday, nearly 1 000 men have attempted to land and have landed in the Canaries. The European Union must not push the problem back outside its borders. The countries of Africa cannot resolve the problem of migratory pressure on their own. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recently led a delegation of MEPs in the Canaries. It is true that the European Union is proposing aid and protection at the borders, but there are still men and women thronging the beaches. The meeting on migration, which will be held next week in Rabat, is a first, very encouraging step. Finally, representatives from the countries of Africa and Europe are going to get together around a table in order to find some solutions. The codevelopment policy that Europe is due to put in place tomorrow must become more effective, more intelligent and more secure, so as to assure us that the funds allocated will benefit the people, and them alone. If we are effective in our efforts to help the people of Africa to remain in their own countries by enabling them to live decent lives, then we will not have to count the dead bodies on the beaches of Italy, Malta or Spain. In an area without internal borders, such as our Schengen area, coordination and information-sharing among the various national immigration policies of the 25 Member States are crucial. The first important stage in achieving that aim is to improve the exchange of information among the Member States. My report concerns the establishment of a mutual information procedure in the areas of asylum and immigration. Each Member State must communicate to the other Member States and to the Commission the national measures that it plans to take. The main points developed are as follows: all of the Member States will have to supply information concerning their present national legislative state of play. This information will therefore constitute an initial database that will help us to become acquainted with the various policies currently in force and to understand what changes subsequently need to be made. My second point relates to the political dimension. The new procedure will act as a permanent link between national administrations. It is important to make progress and to add a political dimension to this administrative level. This will be the aim of this new tool. The final point that I want to mention relates to public accessibility. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled some amendments aimed at opening up the network to the public. I have always been in favour of more transparency in decision-making procedures, but not in this particular case. I shall explain what I mean by this: all of the legislative texts that have already been adopted at national level are naturally made public. Nevertheless, political discussions on the future measures and draft laws under way must remain confidential. Otherwise, governments will refuse to submit their current projects to us and to discuss them with us, and we will never have this information. In concluding the first part of our joint debate, I should like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked effectively over the last few months. I hope that, together, we will demonstrate our will, during tomorrow’s vote, to strive towards greater cooperation among the Member States at EU level. As regards the integration of immigrants, I should like to congratulate our fellow Member, Mr Lambrinidis, on his work and his will - and I stress, his will - to find compromises between all of the political groups. Integration policy represents a mutual commitment on the part of host countries and of legally resident nationals of third countries. This commitment comprises rights and obligations for both parties. Immigration cannot be promoted if we cannot give the immigrants a humane reception in relation to work, accommodation and children’s schooling. A successful integration policy therefore hinges on a person’s finding a job. This, in turn, hinges on his or her ability to speak the language of the host country. Immigrants also need to have access to civic education classes and to programmes on equality between men and women in order to become better acquainted with the values of the host country. The reports presented this evening deal with the immigration and integration policies within the European Union. The idea of this comprehensive debate is particularly interesting, because it is difficult to dissociate the two issues. Immigration and the integration of immigrants are subjects that rarely leave people indifferent. These very sensitive issues are at the centre of countless questions and debates that mobilise governments, citizens and elected representatives. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the management of migratory flows will take place at European level, because, together, we must build a safer, more prosperous and fair Europe.

 The EU is founded on a community based on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. By coming together, the 25 Member States decided to uphold and to promote these values. The numerous racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks that have taken place in recent times in Europe are therefore unacceptable and intolerable. It is crucial to condemn them publicly. This is why I drew up a resolution on behalf of my political group. In it, I have invited the EU institutions, the Member States and all the democratic political parties in Europe to condemn all acts of intolerance and incitement to hatred. We must remain vigilant, but must not lump everything together by listing examples of individual attacks perpetrated in Member States fighting against racism and homophobia with extreme positions openly adopted by some governments. What is more, the list of tragic examples contained in the joint resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is not an exhaustive one. Let me make one thing clear: the fight against all forms of racism is not a matter of right or left. I therefore voted for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and for the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the other groups.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is founded on a community based on the indivisible and universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. By coming together, our countries decided to uphold and to promote these values. Each political group has decided to table a resolution to follow up the statements we have just heard; I personally have drawn one up on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Almost every day we see evidence that the fight against intolerance is far from won. I would have preferred to deal with this subject in a different manner. It is appalling that we still have to point out publicly that racism in our societies is intolerable. Numerous racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks have taken place in recent times in our countries, and that is unacceptable and intolerable. While as citizens we must remain vigilant, as elected representatives we must stand firm and vigorously condemn this behaviour; to stay quiet would be tantamount to accepting it. We must also adopt laws to protect our fellow citizens – political will is crucial in this area – and countries that have not laid down anti-racist and anti-discrimination laws must do so. I shall repeat what I said yesterday in this House and what I have been saying for some months in committee. The Council must immediately stop blocking the framework decision against racism and xenophobia, otherwise fine words and good intentions will serve no purpose. Our respective governments must offer an example and move forward in this fight for equality, respect for others and tolerance. As for the current situation, it is unfortunately necessary to point out that we are seeing a rise in far-right parties in many of our countries. Although I personally am fully committed to this fight, I understand my group’s reasons for not signing the joint text: this text clings on to ideological positions that have become obsolete. These countries will not be moved forward along the path of rigorous respect for the Union’s values by our condemning any particular current situation. It is unacceptable to confuse individual cases of aggression perpetrated in Member States fighting against racism and homophobia with extreme positions openly adopted by some governments. We must distinguish between these situations. It is dangerous to lump everything together. We must separate this issue from the debate relating to any particular motive. The fight against racism, xenophobia and homophobia is not a matter for the left or for the right; that is something we must accept. That is why the joint resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow seems to me to be a balanced compromise. I shall end by saying that I very much regret that Parliament is reluctant to speak with one voice on this subject. This is an opportunity missed, since I know that this is a fight that all of us here in Parliament share in. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although my political group does not share the same positions as the rapporteur, I should like to thank Mrs Ždanoka for her work and her contribution to this subject, which I hold dear. The rapporteur has demonstrated her desire to advance further in the collective and daily fight against discrimination. This political will is, in fact, crucial, and I should like to take advantage of this opportunity, once again, to remind the Council, which is still blocking the framework-decision against racism and xenophobia, that this interruption is altogether unacceptable. My group is not completely satisfied with the report: several paragraphs are long, unclear and the proposed definitions may give rise to misinterpretation. Two points trouble us in particular. Firstly, paragraph 11: my group cannot accept the rapporteur's proposal to grant migrants of Roma origin and non-citizens the right to vote in all elections, as that is going much too far. If migrants or non-citizens wish to participate in the life of the country in which they are settled, then they can quite simply request to become full citizens of that country, provided that the country helps them to gain access to citizenship. Secondly, paragraph 30: it is obviously crucial to treat all forms of discrimination on an equal footing. Combating homophobia in our societies is therefore of the utmost importance. That is why the first part of the paragraph concerned is entirely satisfactory, but we will not vote in favour of the second part calling for the principle of mutual recognition to be applied to same-sex marriages. We must respect the rules and the laws of the various Member States. Ladies and gentlemen, the message that our Parliament must send out is clear: yes, we must respect each individual, and yes, we must promote tolerance, equal opportunities and diversity, but we must do so while respecting the principle of subsidiarity.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the importance she attached to our collaboration. The European project derives its richness from the cultural diversity of its Member States. Thus, intercultural dialogue is now, more than ever, a process to be encouraged. The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will provide the opportunity. To achieve this, I envisage a two-way communication. European citizens must be able to gain access to the cultures of other European and non-European countries, particularly their neighbours. In parallel there is a need to increase awareness among the rest of the world of the cultures and values of the Union, in order to foster mutual understanding. Similarly, intercultural dialogue has to be a driving force for the social integration of immigrants. As shadow rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the European Year in 2007, I would emphasise the importance of cohesion and consistency in the actions to be undertaken in 2007 in support of universal equality of opportunity, and would also stress the importance of cohesion in the initiatives forming part of the 2008 cultural dialogue, as these two years complement one another. I would also invite the Commission and the parties involved – in particular civil society, as the Commissioner has said – to take the opportunity of the major events planned for 2008, such as the football World Cup or the Olympic Games, to make the public, and especially the target group of young people, more aware of the importance of intercultural dialogue.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Roure for her work on this report. The European Union has made a commitment to promoting basic rights and equal opportunities for all. We have some of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the world. But ask yourself this: are our fellow citizens aware of the European anti-discrimination directives? Do they know that all the Member States are obliged to transpose those directives into their national legislation? Unfortunately, I think the answer is no. That is why the initiative of launching the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All is a very constructive one. A media event on this scale is an effective method of increasing awareness and providing information. Equality of opportunity is a policy involving specific measures that aim to help the disadvantaged by establishing fair access to rights, goods and services. For equality to become a reality, we need to combat all types of discrimination. Every day, men and women suffer discrimination when they try to access jobs and services, particularly due to their sex, their origin or their religion. That is unacceptable, and we cannot continue to tolerate such practices. The activities that the EU will support in 2007 and the awareness and demonstration campaigns are a step in the right direction. It is also vital to have a real political will for this, and all the Member States must join forces, without exception. Full implementation of our anti-discrimination legislation therefore remains a top priority. It is distressing to see that certain Member States have been condemned for not having correctly transposed the European directives in this field. Tomorrow, Parliament must send a strong message to our fellow citizens by adopting this report by a large majority. The fight against discrimination is not just fought by the left or by the right. It is fought by men and women of conviction with a common objective: fighting for respect for human rights and, more specifically, against discrimination of all kinds.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as my fellow Members have stressed in their speeches, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are three countries where human rights are being flagrantly and persistently violated while the international community stands idly by. Although these countries are making economic reforms that are necessary for their development, they are forgetting the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens, especially those of ethnic and religious minorities. I would like more particularly to draw your attention to the situation of the Hmong population in Laos. These people have been persecuted by the people’s army continuously for 30 years because their parents or grandparents fought on the side of the United States in the Vietnam war. There are said to be nearly 20 000 of them surviving in the jungle under appalling conditions, conditions that fly in the face of the human rights principles we all support. They live off leaves and roots and are so insecure they are forced to move their villages regularly. Their children receive no education and suffer from malnutrition. Several hundred of them surrendered to the authorities, but they were arrested or disappeared. The central government denies the facts. The international community learned their story recently thanks to the media. It is time we opened our eyes and in particular strongly condemned this campaign of repression, extermination even, that is being conducted with complete impunity. We must call on the Laotian Government to allow international and non-governmental organisations free access to the areas concerned – that is the only way those people will get the food and care they need – and, above all, press the government to integrate these populations into Laotian society with the fundamental rights and freedoms they have been denied until today. We know that the Laotian economy depends on aid from foreign donors, much of it from the European Union; the international community and the European Union therefore have means of bringing pressure to bear on the country’s authorities. We hope, Madam President, that the Commission and the Council will heed these calls and help the populations of South-East Asia.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate and thank Mrs Klamt for all of the work she has put in on this report on managing economic migration. The best way of implementing a genuinely effective immigration policy that is actually accepted by the citizens is by means of a balanced approach, and that is precisely what Mrs Klamt has proposed. The notions of, on the one hand, accepting everybody and, on the other, building up the myth of zero immigration, are neither realistic nor particularly responsible. It is high time that Europe addressed immigration calmly, frankly and humanely. Let us not wait for further tragedies before addressing the issue. It is no longer conceivable for each Member State to implement its own immigration policy in its own backyard. No State can take such decisions alone. What Europe needs is a truly global, common and coherent approach. Working together, we must try to establish partnerships with countries of origin and transit in order to manage migratory flows and the acceptance of migrants. We must be realistic. We will not solve the problem by building walls and barbed wire – reminding us of previous eras – by strengthening border policies or by building reception and detention centres. These men and women come to Europe not to have fun, but to survive and to feed their families. The real problem is the difference between our continent and the countries of origin in terms of development and living standards. The EU must take action to bridge this gap by means of a genuine co-development policy, which entails financing projects to encourage migrants to stay in their countries in decent living conditions. The second crucial point is that common measures must be put in place regarding legal immigration. Short-term, piecemeal responses, such as mass regularisation, are not the answer. Take Spain, for example, which recently regularised 700 000 people, and which is now experiencing the biggest bombardment of immigrants in its history. That is not the answer. It is one possible answer, but only if backed up by a genuine common policy, based on both justice and security, enabling the harmonious regulation of migratory flows. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is equipped with specialised structures and financial means. The time has come to end the interminable rhetoric and to take action. We can no longer stand by as human beings die simply because they wanted to come to our countries for a better life.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked a great deal over the last few months to draft a comprehensive and consistent report on some very sensitive topics: my report relates to legal and illegal immigration and integration policies. Since time immemorial, humans have emigrated to escape poverty or persecution, in search of happiness, in pursuit of a better future. Today, with globalisation and the proliferation of transport options, migratory flows have become denser and more complex. They are the result of a new aspiration for men and women throughout the world, to go to work in other countries, to benefit from other experiences. They are also the result of inequalities that are present across the world, the result of poverty, the curse of too many regions in the world. In the context of national elections, in some Member States, immigration is a recurring theme in electoral campaigns. Some countries decide to seal their borders and adopt tough measures, while others regularise thousands of illegal immigrants. The European Union seems to be divided in relation to the issue of immigration. It is true that each Member State has the right to decide how many immigrants it intends to accept, but Europe no longer has internal borders. As a consequence, any national measure has significant direct repercussions on the other Member States. It is therefore now essential for the Member States to organise themselves at European level. The solution to many of the problems they face must be both European and national. Certain political parties systematically make use of election periods to draw prejudicial parallels between insecurity, terrorism and immigration, fostering in our fellow citizens a fear of immigrants and foreigners. This is, of course, unacceptable. It is vital, firstly, to provide objective, transparent and regular information on immigration policy and, secondly, to launch information campaigns aimed at the population, in order to change people’s perceptions of immigrants as criminals. In my report, I wanted to take a responsible, balanced, comprehensive approach. Responsible, because we need to deal with these subjects with a greater sense of responsibility: we must not forget that we are dealing with men and women, not with goods! I also wanted to take a balanced approach: the Member States must not base their policies either entirely on security considerations or entirely on a spirit of liberalism. We therefore need to transcend national differences and take the heat out of the debate in order to develop a humane and effective European immigration policy. Finally, I wanted a comprehensive approach to increase consistency and effectiveness. I would like to deal with a number of aspects that I have discussed in my report. Firstly, the need for an active policy of co-development to combat the basic causes of immigration. Secondly, combating illegal immigration by means of stricter controls at our external borders, dismantling human trafficking networks, harsher penalties, very harsh, for businesses that use clandestine workers. Thirdly, legal immigration: if the EU needs to open its borders to legal immigrants in response to the predicted decline in the active population, it must do so in an organised, concerted way. Finally, policy on the integration of immigrants: admission and integration policies are inseparable. The Member States must implement more proactive policies. For their part, immigrants must understand and respect the fundamental values of the host country: learning the language, civic education courses and better integration into the labour market are some of the important elements of this. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that immigration is a good thing for the country of origin, for the host country and for the immigrants themselves when it is controlled and co-managed. That is the principle of win-win immigration, controlled and managed jointly. Neither welcoming all comers nor setting as an objective the myth of zero immigration is a realistic or particularly responsible position. Each State must accept immigrants depending on its integration capability, its own interests and those of the country of origin. The subject of immigration is too sensitive, sometimes too tragic, to continue to make it the subject of political sparring matches. One vision must prevail when we discuss it: where are people in all this? Of course, we have to be realistic, but we must also take into consideration the undeniable human brotherhood and the solidarity that it entails. Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament must give a strong and unified signal to the Council and to the citizens of Europe so that rapid progress can be made in immigration and integration policies. I therefore hope that this report will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a sorrowful anniversary will be commemorated tomorrow everywhere in Europe: the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, a symbol of all the camps built by the Nazis with the sole aim of carrying out the planned extermination of 11 million Jews then living in Europe. More than half were reduced to ashes. At a time when their ashes are still not cold, a number of people have, again recently, attempted to deny or relativise absolute barbarity. Sadly, two of them are Members of this House. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a matter of honour for this Parliament to use this resolution against anti-Semitism – which, I hope, will be voted unanimously in favour of – to contribute to the fight against this scourge and also against all forms of xenophobia, racism and discrimination. It is a matter of honour for this Parliament to fight against all those who would falsify history. It is a matter of honour for this Parliament to pursue the politics of peace and unity that motivate us all by recommending that we never slacken our efforts in the unfailing service of education and tolerance and in teaching people about this black period of European and world history. At a time when, just about everywhere in Europe, violent anti-Semitism is resurfacing and various forms of intolerance are on the rise, we need to ask ourselves how we are to keep this memory alive in history when the surviving witnesses are no longer there. Our Parliament must thus encourage those Member States which have not yet done so to adopt legislative provisions along these lines, as a number of European countries have already done. This House is in the process of building a better future for future generations, with more freedom, more democracy, more tolerance and more mutual respect. Today, we are helping to ensure that no one ever forgets what human folly was capable of bringing about. Our support for this resolution will be a clear signal to our peoples, to our children, to future generations and to all those who fight for peace and human brotherhood.

About time too! It was about time that we had a report that takes into consideration the specific features of social services of general interest. SSGIs, which are to be distinguished from the other services of general economic interest, warranted this clarification of the definition of their tasks and organisational principles. On the other hand, SSGIs are a key component of the European social model that we are very keen not just to protect, but above all to promote. It is therefore a good thing that the European Parliament has taken up this major issue. The compromise that we have managed to reach in this House is satisfactory, so I have therefore voted in favour of the Hasse Ferreira report. This decision would appear consistent with the way in which the European Parliament has voted since the Gerbhardt/Harbour compromise on the Services Directive and, more recently, since the Rapkay/Hokmark compromise on the Rapkay report. I should like to make it clear once again in this House that this decision does not commit us in any way to a framework directive on services of general economic interest. However, this report is not enough. I am referring here to the necessary sectoral directive on health services.

 Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor. It goes without saying that I am grateful to Mr Lewandowski for having withdrawn the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets: that is going to make our task much easier. We are on the eve of an agreement at first reading, and this will be a triple victory: a victory for European workers, a victory for the proper functioning of our institutions and, I believe, a victory over ourselves, because we will have been able to overcome our political and national divisions.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow, we shall in fact give our verdict for the third time on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The founding act of the project was the adoption of the Böge report on the 2007-2013 financial perspective. In addition to the draft Fund, Article 28 of the interinstitutional agreement thus defines the annual sum of EUR 500 million, budgeted over seven years, together with part of the budgetary procedure. The second ratification was expressed within the context of Mr Cottigny's own-initiative report on restructuring and employment, which was adopted in March: the latest events in the automobile sector tend to make us more vigilant regarding the future of weakened or declining economic sectors. I should like, on the occasion of our debate, to pass on my thoughts and to give my support to the employees affected by the social disaster at the Volkswagen plant in Forest. Parliament has therefore twice voiced its support for the conclusions of the Hampton Court Summit, which ratified the draft fund devised by the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted the report on the draft regulation on Thursday 26 October by a very large majority, and this serves as a basis for the negotiations in trialogue, the aim of which is to obtain an agreement at first reading, such that, as you said, Commissioner, the fund might be operational as from 1 January. The negotiation in trialogue ended positively on Thursday 30 November, with my agreement and with that of Mr Andersson and Mr Lewandowski, together with that of the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Seppänen, on the budgetary part, where he had access to enhanced cooperation. I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive spirit – this report belongs to you, Mr Cottigny, Mr Beaupuy and Mrs Schroedter – as well as the group coordinators. I am also grateful to the representatives from the Commission and from the Finnish Presidency. The day after the trialogue, the agreement was ratified at the Council by Coreper: an agreement at first reading on the creation of the EGF is therefore in the hands of the MEPs, who will vote tomorrow. Four principles have guided the work of our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we have preserved them throughout the debate. The first principle is European added value. It is by no means a question of substituting for the Member States when it comes to dealing with the social effects of industrial disasters. The EGF’s operations will be focused on cases symbolising European-wide social disasters, which take place following a change in the structure of international trade. The European Parliament has therefore specifically insisted that the 50% cofinancing rule be laid down in Article 10 of our regulation, thus marking the European ambition and not the provision of European aid for international issues. Equally, we have introduced the transnational element of certain issues. The second principle is responsibility. Responsible, as it is, for international trade negotiations, the European Union thus accepts the potential consequences of its strategic decisions. Our responsibility is indeed to accept the positive aspects of globalisation, but also to take account of its potentially negative effects. The third principle is justice. Justice firstly, because we are addressing men and women. Territorial justice, too, because all of the Member States are involved, and we have rejected discrimination against small labour markets, which will be eligible from now on via the safeguard clause and the extension of the provisions of Article 2 b). The fourth principle is effectiveness. In Article 3, on eligible actions, we have clearly prohibited passive social protection measures. We want proactive measures aimed at getting workers back to work, particularly older workers, who should not be condemned to compulsory early retirement or to prolonged periods of unemployment. The EGF programme thus has a place in the Lisbon Strategy, in that it helps European competitiveness. Effectiveness also means controlling and evaluating the process, on which our Parliament has laid a great deal of emphasis. Our objective is well and truly to provide Europe, thanks to the EGF, with a similar instrument to the one that has already existed for 40 years in the United States in the form of the Trade Adjustment Act, which last year helped more than 170 000 US employees, over 70% of whom found a long-term job. Many of my colleagues support the idea of the Fund, but regret the lack of money involved. I understand them. Nevertheless, I would emphasise the fact that this is an experimental move, which will have to be analysed, then refined and enhanced. This experimental move will constitute the first stage in the establishment of a genuine global European strategy on globalisation. There is no such strategy today, and not for long will we be able to remain the only strategic trade actor in the world to do without such a road map.

 Mr President, I also take the floor with the agreement of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to support the position of my fellow Member, Mr Cottigny, and to request that the vote and the debate be postponed. In fact, as my fellow Member has just said, the latest information concerning the Council’s positions reached us only a few hours ago. Our discussions thus far indicate that the positions of the Council and Parliament, expressed by the two competent committees, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, have come much closer together. It is not guaranteed, but on this basis we could perhaps reach an agreement at first reading, which would enable us to make this fund operational from the beginning of next year, as hoped for, I believe, by almost all the Members of this House. That is why I support Mr Cottigny’s position.

 Mr President, fellow Members, you usefully referred, Mr Barroso, to the four basic principles that need to guide our thinking about services of general interest. Paradoxically, it might be thought that you have reopened the debate on the need either to have a framework directive on services of general economic interest or to choose sectoral initiatives in relation to social or health services. The vote on the Services Directive altered the parameters in favour of the second solution since the real dividing line lies not between services of economic and non-economic general interest but – within services of general economic interest – between social and health services and other services. This development was reinforced by the detailed and legally painstaking work done by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, and our colleague, Mr Hökmark, who constructed a legal bridge between the Services Directive and the sectoral instruments. Indeed, a framework directive on services of general economic interest raises three difficulties. Firstly, the Treaty on European Union offers no legal basis, as has been pointed out on many occasions. Next, this directive would be incompatible with the scope of the Services Directive, as voted on at first reading on 29 May. Finally, it in no respect meets the need for legal certainty expressed by the players and, at the same time, it threatens the subsidiarity called for by Member States and local authorities. Whatever the instrument selected and the ideological choices that will help determine the option we choose, these are not what matter in the end. The work of legal clarification needs to be continued in the field of social and health services of general interest. That, Mr Barroso, is the practical problem faced by the actors on the ground.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in times of uncertainty, the European Union must return to its basic principles. We now need to complete the implementation of the four freedoms that form the basis of the internal market. The free movement of workers still needs to be implemented and, to that end, it is vital to lift the restrictions imposed when the new Member States acceded as soon as possible. This distrust is misplaced, because we can see that, in the 15 countries where the restrictions have been lifted, there have been no massive influxes. Surprisingly, only 2% of European citizens work outside their country, whereas a third of Americans live in a state other than the one in which they were born. The invasion is nothing but a fantasy, and the mobility of workers is a challenge. Mr Őry's report sets the objective of lifting the restrictions by 2009, and I support this objective. The French Prime Minister has also indicated that France would anticipate this movement by lifting these restrictions in a gradual and controlled manner. The resolution adopted by the European Trade Union Confederation in December 2005 opens up paths that reconcile the opening up of borders with appropriate protection. The amendments adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go down this route, in order to ensure that employment law is applied in the Member States, specifically to ensure that Community standards are implemented, in particular those in the posting of workers directive, and in order to look into the creation of a European centre to coordinate the inspection services of the Member States. By producing standardised statistics on Community migration, we will be able to set up the toolkit for a social Europe within the Union, which will confirm that the free movement of workers must not be synonymous with dumping or the lowest common social denominator, but must be a factor in the economic dynamism that will enable us to iron out pockets of under-employment.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his outstanding report. In order to face up to the impact of demographic shock, it is usual to resort to three levers: a carefully chosen and regulated immigration policy, mobilisation of the workforce and policies aimed at families and at increasing the birth rate. This latter kind of approach is usually left to the Member States. It would be wrong, nonetheless, for the European Union to deny itself these resources. Their effectiveness is well known, and the French example testifies to that: tax incentives for families, parental leave, financial assistance and, above all, the provision of child-care – out of school child care, a range of facilities for the care of very young children and care for children with disabilities. What is more, it is important to remember that it will not be possible to massively recruit women into the labour market without proper provision for the care of their children. Europe does not lack the means, provided that it has the political will and the financial resources. It is therefore essential for the policy regulations for territorial cohesion to underline more strongly the need for funding for child care facilities. At a time when the debate is raging over the nature of the European social model, children and families, with all their diversity, must be fundamental to this model.

Mr President, I should like to table an amendment so as to clarify matters. A fund designed to support workers affected by restructuring is going to be set up. Mr Cottigny’s report refers to this as a growth adjustment fund, and I propose that, in order to avoid any confusion, we revert to the name used by the European Commission, that is to say a European globalisation adjustment fund.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, restructuring brings two worlds together: the economic world, where restructuring is necessary in order to face up to the changes mandated by globalisation and customer expectations, and the social world, where it is often a source of suffering and anxiety for employees. This restructuring is taking on a whole new dimension with the emergence of new powers, resulting in a new aspect to work sharing, which will lead to Europe being forced to develop the service sector while giving up on being an agricultural and industrial power. We refuse to accept this prospect. In this context, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to demonise necessary restructuring, but feels that the European market needs to promote a regulatory framework to absorb the shocks of this globalisation. The internal market is not the cause for restructuring – it is the antidote to it. Even so, this European model is also a humanist model, and we need to take into consideration the suffering caused to the people and the territories affected by this phenomenon. The question that arises is this: how can we encourage socially responsible restructuring? Mr Cottigny's report allows us to look at a number of approaches, to which our group contributed. An initial approach involves reviewing the European Works Council directive and increasing the role of the social partners, following in-depth consultation with them: the rapporteur has proposed an amendment in this respect, which we support. Other approaches include access to expertise and the exchange of good practices, which is a relevant area for the open method of coordination; vocational training, with regard to which we are pleased that the support fund proposed by Mr Barroso supports retraining for the workers affected and is not devoted to risky salvage operations; and optimising the support for our solidarity policies from the ESF/ERDF structural funds, on condition, Commissioner, that they are not compromised by the delayed financial perspective. I will, of course, conclude by mentioning research and innovation. I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur Mr Cottigny for his open-mindedness, which made it possible to reach a number of compromises and which should, barring disasters, allow our group to vote in favour of his report.

 Mr President, with regard to the report by my colleague Mr Őry, I am torn between three feelings: satisfaction, regret and a wish. My satisfaction is at the completion of the efforts initiated in 1994 to take a concerted approach to the risks faced by workers. The attitude of our societies towards life's risks is a key element in the European social model that differentiates it from many others. My regret is that the European Commission, under pressure from the Council, was not willing to negotiate with Parliament regarding the most reasonable solution, namely invoking the subsidiarity principle. That would have relieved our fear that the states would be obliged to transpose the rules on solar radiation because they are referred to in the framework directive. The Council turning its nose up at the subsidiarity principle in collusion with the Commission – that really is a paradox! My wish is that in future we will be able to deal with the issue of solar radiation flexibly, without pointless legislation or bureaucracy. For example, the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, based in Bilbao, could launch a major information campaign aimed at European workers, warning them of the risks presented by exposure to the sun.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us imagine the follow-up to our work. It is time we reminded ourselves that we are in a codecision procedure here. Cleverly, our colleague, Mr Harbour, was able to abandon the idea of a parliamentary victory, which was the likely outcome but which led straight to the slow agony of drafting a crucial text on services. His tour of the European capital cities confirmed to him what we already know. The compromise drafted with Mrs Gebhardt – to whom I should like to pay tribute - is the only one possible within the Council and between Parliament and the Council. There is no qualified majority vote within the Council for the kind of internal market that some people want. To persist in wanting this kind of market would be a Pyrrhic victory. What, moreover, is chiefly apparent is that the difference between us has become a difference between the East and the West. On the basis of this observation, it is the logic of enlargement that is today called into question. Let us not forget that the failure of the Services Directive would be added to a list that includes the collapse of the Constitution, the concerns about the financial perspective and the doubts about the Lisbon Agenda. We must now participate in a reconciliation strategy in order to keep the Community ambition alive. I identified a real problem in the discrimination felt by the new Member States when faced with the restrictions imposed on the free movement of workers. I want helpfully to say to those countries that it is not by rejecting the compromise and thus, in the long run, the Services Directive or by bringing into question the Posting of Workers Directive that they will overcome this discrimination – quite the opposite. That was the thinking behind the work that we, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, carried out under the aegis of Mrs Van Lancker when we deleted Articles 24 and 25 from the initial text. From now on, we must solemnly call for the moratorium to be abandoned and for all the restrictions on the free movement of workers from the new Member States to be lifted. It would also be worthwhile linking these issues during the Council debate on the Services Directive. However, a study of the text has also demonstrated the many shortcomings in the Community’s legal arsenal. Some Members have voiced legitimate fears, and these fears must be dealt with. Let us take stock of the undeniable progress constituted by this text, because our job as legislator has only just begun.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I supported Mr Tannock's report on the European Neighbourhood Policy, which was adopted on the same day as the Duff-Voggenhuber report on the future of the constitutional process. Parliament has thus taken a consistent and ambitious political position that I very much welcome. The Constitutional Treaty will not be ratified without clearly established borders, enabling us to say which of the countries of Eurasia are not cut out to join the EU and which should be making active preparations for accession. In addition, the European Union's ambitions include a common foreign and security policy that, before putting the EU on the grand international diplomatic stage, should concentrate on its sphere of influence, and partnerships with the States and political communities around us. The whole point of this valuable contribution from Parliament is to define the future content of our policy towards Russia, Turkey, the Middle East and the Maghreb. Finally, I would like to welcome the report's reference to the need to define this neighbourhood policy in the near future, in agreement with the existing pan-European organisations such as the OECD and the Council of Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has prided itself on having spearheaded the fight against discrimination where equality between men and women, the status of ethnic minorities, the situation of disabled people and, more recently, respect for people’s sexual orientation are concerned. Article 13 of the Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and numerous directives make it not only the right, but also the duty, of our Assembly to continue to fight for the equal rights of homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals. In view of the substantial progress recorded in this area in many Member States, some people had hoped, if not for this matter to have been settled, then at least for it to have died down. No such thing has happened, and a real upsurge in homophobic language and violence can even be observed. The recent remarks made by Polish political leaders dismayed us, with the European Commission, I am afraid to say, only reacting to them in a very half-hearted manner. Other unacceptable speeches of this kind have been made in other countries, including France. Violent acts, ranging from insults to torture and murder, are to be deplored everywhere. These crimes are taking place in a particularly worrying international context, in countries such as Egypt, Lebanon and Senegal. Homosexuals are being persecuted because of the way in which they live their lives. Worse still, in Iran, two have been executed. We are therefore delighted to welcome the Commission statement on homophobia in the European Union. Our colleague from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Stubb, had prepared a resolution, on behalf of our group, calling on the Commission and the Member States to take practical legislative and operational measures to combat these forms of discrimination. Today, it is a resolution common to five political groups that we are examining. One can only be delighted to see that, in this Chamber, the fight for human rights has transcended partisan borders. The pious hopes contained in the Commission’s statements must now be very swiftly replaced by a practical and comprehensive directive. Equally, it is up to each one of us to continue this fight in our respective countries for a form of equality that consists not only of the right to other people’s indifference towards their sexuality, but also of the right to be different.

I decided not to shirk my responsibilities in order to tell Mr Gollnisch, publicly and quite frankly, why I will not defend his immunity. There is a strong temptation to express an opinion about the content of the remarks attributed to the Front National 
member. There is a strong temptation to want only to remember the martyrdom of the Jewish people, by dismissing the only debate worth having, that of the conditions governing the application of parliamentary immunity. There is a strong temptation to reject the defence of Mr Gollnisch’s immunity by regarding him solely as the representative of an ideology which nearly all of this Assembly rejects and in opposition to which the European project was conceived on the basis of the European idea. Conversely, there may well be a strong temptation to call for this defence of immunity as part of a corporatist reflex to make sure that no remarks can be held against any one of us. I call on you not to give in to these temptations and not to transform a technical debate into a debate belonging to historians. Our Assembly is not a court. Mrs Wallis’ report is balanced. She reminds us that immunity is not designed to protect Members of the European Parliament, but to protect the integrity of the European Parliament, through its representatives, and to give them the independence with which to carry out their tasks. There is no doubt that, in Lyon, in the heart of the university where he teaches, far from his constituency in north-east France, Mr Gollnisch was not speaking as a Member of the European Parliament. Mr Gollnisch lives dangerously, constantly on the razor’s edge. This form of political life is, in reality, peculiar to the extreme right-wing in France and Germany. Mr Gollnisch is far too cultivated and intelligent not to have realised that his remarks were in danger of being condemned by French law. If he must rush headlong into a legal tussle in order to remain faithful to what he believes is right, then it is advisable that he does not drag our Parliamentary institution into the matter by involving it in a debate in which it does not belong. The request for defence of immunity, which was put together with your consent, Mr Gollnisch, is halfway between a call for help with no legal basis, given that this procedure does not in any way threaten to prevent you from carrying out your duties, and, as I see it, a baffling attempt to shirk your responsibilities, just as though you were at last overcome with panic at the thought of what you knowingly triggered off and clearly no longer control. I feel no hatred for you, any more than I wish to support you, as a Member of the European Parliament, in this ordeal that you knowingly brought about. It is down to you, on your own, to accept the consequences. It is not perhaps too late for you to change and to make peace with France, Europe and our painful past. I hope that you succeed in doing this. The European Parliament cannot do it for you … (The President cut off the speaker)

Mr President, the report for an opinion on the Regional Development Fund, which I presented to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, was adopted unanimously on three priorities: achievement of the Lisbon objectives, a policy of sustainable full employment and an ambitious policy for people with disabilities. This dossier goes far beyond social concerns and encompasses the Community’s priorities, and it is likely to become the Union’s dominant policy, ahead of the Common Agricultural Policy, in three areas, namely solidarity, effectiveness and justice. Solidarity with the new Member States, but under certain conditions. Respect for the internal market’s competition rules. Solidarity must not mean weakness. I therefore agree with fellow Members, like our rapporteur Mr Fava, who propose not including VAT among reimbursable expenses and not reallocating resources that have become subject to automatic release under the N+2 rule. These policies must be optimised. Until now, we have seen that credits have been devoted to simple projects, to the detriment of projects of structural significance. This mistake is regrettable and could be exacerbated by the performance reserve. Our approach should be one of concentrating our focus on a reduced number of topics. Solidarity and effectiveness: effectiveness means pursuing the aims of the Lisbon Agenda and investing in research and the development of employment. Solidarity, effectiveness and justice: this policy must remain a Community policy, directed at all Member States. I am grateful to Commissioner Hübner for having agreed with this during her visit to my region – the Loire – last Thursday. Uncertainty regarding the financial perspectives – as you have seen, Mr Michael – has not stopped us from giving our views on spending and on structural changes. The British Presidency may well be faced with the same situation. Finally, I would express the hope, certainly shared by our rapporteur Mr Fava, that a consensus may emerge on these reports similar to the one achieved on the Böge report. The subjects of both reports are related. Parliament will perform its role all the more effectively if the Council’s position is not too distant from the one we have defined. In this difficult period, it is important that the European Parliament should remain committed to the Community’s seriousness of purpose and ambition.

 Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Alstom group has been causing grave disquiet for many months. It is the future of Alstom’s 25 000 employees in France that is at issue. We have had to fight hard and our government has put itself firmly on the side of the Alstom employees. It was our Minister for Finance, Mr Sarkozy, who negotiated with the Commissioner at the time, Mr Monti, so that we could grant the aid that saved Alstom. It was of course a question of safeguarding the future of the employees, but also of saving a jewel in the European energy and transport industry. This evening, we are talking about Vélizy and Stuttgart, but also about Brno in the Czech Republic and Setúbal in Portugal, and large numbers of subcontractors throughout Europe. Today, the announcement that 350 jobs will be lost, including 200 in Vélizy at Alstom Power Boiler, increases the worry for the employees still further. It is true that the weakening in the market for boilers is clear, but it is not at a level that would justify such job losses. It is not down to the Commission, of course, to dictate the management of companies or to manage, on behalf of governments, social assistance for any redundancies. It is worth pointing out that Alstom Power Boiler is a leader in the field of the production of clean coal and is developing technologies for the capture of carbon dioxide. We are therefore not talking about a company condemned by ossification and obsolescence. Acceptance of its migration across the Atlantic or, even worse, its disappearance, is like looking at the future through a rear-view mirror. The employees – and we must congratulate them for this – have developed a plan based around the concept ‘let us create the European champion in clean combustion’. They have, with the help of experts, developed a plan for the future covering all aspects: the legal structure of the new company, technological aspects, commercial aspects, social aspects. We must welcome this approach, which represents a refusal to cave in. It has been brought to the attention of the European partners: the Commissioners responsible for employment and social affairs, enterprise and industry, trade, competition, and environment, who are awaiting your conclusions. Commissioner, today you must look ahead to the cultural and social revolution set in motion by the draft constitutional treaty. In future, social rights, with the constitutional treaty, will prevail over the perfection of the internal market which had the upper hand in previous treaties. Social dialogue will be institutionalised, but above all we must formulate an industrial policy that favours skills centres and will safeguard the social market economy proposed to us as a social model in Article 3 of the constitutional treaty. The question being put to you today, Commissioner, is this: how do you see the future philosophy of the constitutional treaty? Do not be the clerk of the old Europe, but instead put in place the new Europe, the one intended by the constitutional treaty. You have a good opportunity to do so, by safeguarding the future of Alstom Power Boiler.
