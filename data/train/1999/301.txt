 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are analysing and describing the final steps on the road to the peaceful and comprehensive reordering of our continent. Never before in the course of history has a new order been achieved without war or the use of force. This development is thrown into particularly stark relief when we consider the road taken by those states that have been able to overcome what was called ‘actually-existing socialism’ and to find their way to freedom and democracy. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania deserve particular credit for having been able, along the road to freedom, to regain their independence as states. Speaking personally, I am grateful to the people, parliament and government of Latvia, who, with the European Union’s support, have created the conditions for solving an extremely complex problem, that being the progressive integration of a large Russian-speaking minority. When one bears in mind that the country’s ethnic makeup is the result, more than anything else, of decades of occupation, it was not self-evident that this would happen, nor was it so in view of constant misunderstandings and suppositions on the part of, among others, the Russian Duma. At this point, I want to extend thanks to Mr Brok, who, this morning, gave voice to clear expectation of a change in the Russian position. Like Estonia, Latvia has set itself a task with, in future, a European dimension. I am convinced that the Russian-speaking minority will be successfully integrated into Latvian society, but that will depend on these citizens giving unmistakeable demonstrations of their loyalty to the Latvian state. It is also dependent upon their unconditional acceptance of the values and principles of the European Union. Future stronger and more extensive cooperation with Russia will depend, above all, on Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania putting down deep roots in the European Union. This cooperation is a strategic challenge for the European Union as a whole and the new Member States will have an indispensable contribution to make to it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, days such as today are an occasion to look back as well as forward. We look back to the years of radical change from 1989 to 1991, when the nations of the former Warsaw Pact strove successfully to secure their freedom and independence. We look back on a difficult period of transformation, which is now giving way to a period of stability in our continent, a political stability that used to be almost inconceivable. In this context, it is quite rare to hear the applicant countries being acclaimed for having largely fulfilled the political criteria of Copenhagen right from the start of the negotiations. That is no mean achievement in view of their great economic difficulties, the residual effects of the planned economy and a sense of insecurity among the population. When I think of Latvia, for example – a country towards which I feel a special sense of affinity and commitment – I wonder how much will-power it took for the Latvians to accept former occupiers as partners and fellow citizens. I think of the referendum of 3 October 1989, when 53% of the Latvian electorate voted in favour of amendments to the country’s nationality laws, amendments which corresponded with European standards and were therefore beneficial to minorities such as the large community of native Russian-speakers. An important development of recent years that we should preserve in the new European Union is the experience of intensive cooperation across the external borders of the Union. How quickly Euro-regions materialised! The cooperation proposals that have yielded such rich fruit in recent years should also be extended to the neighbours we shall have on our new borders. Proposals to benefit ordinary people on the future external borders of the Union – the people of Russia, the people of Belorussia and the people of the Ukraine. We must not be deterred by the present difficulties. Even now we must cast our eyes beyond the external borders. Cross-border cooperation should become a prime instrument of our future security policy. (Applause)

 The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance, but whether the Czech Republic is founded upon the European order is a matter of doubt. Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts. This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.' It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that ‘ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture’. This is an unambiguous verdict. It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain. Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the ‘events full of violence and human tragedies’, which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were ‘unacceptable acts from today's point of view’, nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it. They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture. This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should surely endorse the Commission's basic statements on the development of the Northern Dimension and the shape it should take in the future, including such things as the diverse subjects to be covered by future cooperation, ranging from the resolution of environmental problems to telecommunications, taking in research and technological development. The list of partners is no less impressive than that of any previous initiative. There can also surely be no dispute about the fact that the accession of the Baltic States to the European Union will be able to rapidly extend cooperation and move it up a gear, and that there will be greater opportunities for developing relations with Russia. Appreciation of these and other positive aspects does not preclude critical observations, and I will limit myself to two of them. It is, for example, striking that the Council, in producing its directives, is to some degree working on the basis of a decidedly uncritical analysis. That has also, alas, and to a somewhat lesser degree, been true of the statements from the Commission. An example of what I mean by this is the uncertainty still felt by many investors with a particular interest in involvement in the candidate countries and in Russia. Deficiencies in administration and in the justice system are kept quiet for appearances' sake rather than described in terms that reflect the reality. Surely it is more than a mere linguistic nuance to say that the efforts at rectifying abuses of this sort must not just be persevered with, but also significantly stepped up. Secondly, development of technological infrastructure has a key part to play in relation to this major region as a whole, and there is a need for this sort of activity, which is at present still largely scattered, to be better interconnected. Existing concepts and plans for road and rail transport need to be realised more quickly if real improvements are to be made. To sum up, the plans made to date, and the results that have been achieved, should be seen in a very positive light. What is now needed is for priorities to be set out more clearly than before and decisive improvements made in key areas.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Members of this Parliament and colleagues from the candidate countries, may I extend a particularly warm welcome to our Latvian colleagues who were elected to their country’s new parliament early in October this year. I welcome them so warmly because I have felt very involved in their efforts and in their work for many years. On days like today I ask myself – and I am sure I am not the only one to do so – what has particularly impressed me about the enlargement process in the last few years. Of the very many remarkable achievements, one is very seldom acknowledged. Many reports by the Commission or Parliament contain a short sentence that is pregnant with meaning – a sentence that rarely receives comment and where the attention paid to it bears no relation to its significance. That sentence reads quite simply – and it applies to all ten candidate countries: ‘The political conditions for accession are satisfied.’ That means the first and for me the most important accession criterion formulated in Copenhagen is not an obstacle. I do not take this fundamental assessment for granted. We ought to express our appreciation to all our colleagues in the parliaments and governments of the candidate countries for having stuck fast to democratic principles even in difficult situations. The cultivation of democratic relations cannot be taken for granted in times of upheaval and reorientation, in times of enormous economic problems and radical changes in circumstances. After decades of dictatorship, the people have shown what the political priority must be: democracy and freedom take precedence; they must be cherished and safeguarded.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exactly one year ago, on 14 May 2001, the Council authorised the Commission to launch a WTO dispute resolution procedure in order to prevent unfair competitive practices by the Republic of Korea. Not only has there been no improvement since then, if anything the disparity has become even greater. International competition is still being grossly distorted by South Korea's price dumping, meaning a further loss of world market share for the European Union. There is a danger that these structural imbalances will become even more marked. For example, South Korea's shipyards are making enormous efforts to get orders for certain types of ship, such as cruise ships, which up to now have been Europe's domain. These continuing problems are putting a strain on a sector of European industry that has had to cope with a difficult adaptation process in recent years. That applies both to capacity reduction and to the need to step up quality and productivity in the remaining yards. The regional impact of this structural change has been and continues to be at its most severe in the peripheral regions. If the very existence of Europe's shipbuilding industry is not to be jeopardised, the protection measures proposed by the Commission for the duration of the dispute resolution procedure are vital. That is why it is important for the Council to approve time-limited protection measures of this kind immediately. Furthermore, the procedures for levying anti-dumping and countervailing duties need to be consistently applied in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Up to now, threats have had no discernible effect on South Korea's behaviour. It is now time for clear-cut action!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's attitude towards the Iraqi Government is, unfortunately, moulded by the stance of that country's rulers, which amounts to blackmail. The policy of aggression pursued by Saddam Hussein and his accomplices has taken large numbers of their own people hostage. The insidious thing about this situation is the way that genuine human and economic distress, much of it artificially made worse, is exploited for political purposes. Generally, this hits the weakest members of society the hardest, but this should not lead us to confuse cause with effect. It is not the sanctions that cause the sufferings of the vast majority of the Iraqi people, but rather the aggression, cunning and incompetence of the totalitarian regime that provoked these sanctions. Every other approach and every attempt to dispel the facts from people's minds has to be firmly resisted. Every utterance focusing exclusively on the direct connection between the consequences of the embargo and the effects on the population falls dangerously short of the mark even when – indeed, especially when – it is well meant, for it thereby shifts and obscures the manifest political responsibility of Iraq's rulers. Anyone who talks about the ruination of the social and technical infrastructure, and about the lack of food and medicines whilst leaving the regime's responsibility out of consideration, passing over it or keeping quiet about it, is behaving naively or irresponsibly, to say the least. The right way ahead was shown by the UN Security Council at its meeting yesterday, when it resolved unanimously to step up the arms embargo and simultaneously to make it easier for Iraq to import goods for civilian use. This is further evidence of the broad agreement that exists between, on the one hand, the report before us and Parliament's resolutions to date, and, on the other, the resolutions of the Security Council and of the UN Commission on Human Rights. This consensus should be emphasised, deepened and built on rather than being tested to breaking point by assertions about the alleged failure of the embargo. Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne's report also picks up and deepens a proposal made as long ago as November 2000 concerning the setting up of a tribunal to punish the Iraqi regime's offences against human rights. I am convinced that trials of this sort can have a deterrent effect – if not on every dictator, then on many of their willing accomplices – and contribute to destabilising their regimes. I therefore unreservedly support the call for the establishment of an investigation authority to collect and assess witness statements and documentation and document evidence that will stand up in court.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur on Latvia's application for membership of the European Union, Mrs Schröder, has made some very important and pertinent observations. They also seemed to me to be very critical. That is why, with your permission, I should now like to highlight two positive points which present the overall picture in a perhaps more favourable and also, in my opinion, a more realistic light. In many reports – and the same is true of the report on Latvia's application, there is a statement at the beginning which is simple and which is important but which cannot be taken for granted. Latvia satisfies the political criteria for membership of the European Union. This simple sentence represents splendid achievements, achievements which deserve respect and recognition. In the light of the difficult situation which these countries were in at the outset and the complicated basic conditions, satisfying the first Copenhagen criterion is a remarkable result. This is especially true for the three Baltic states which, compared with all of the other candidates, were forced to a far greater degree into the totalitarian structures of the former Soviet Union. This applies particularly to Latvia, given the complicated ethnic make-up of its population. It is precisely against this tragic historical background that the systematic and continuous efforts of its parliament and government to integrate all of the country's inhabitants into society deserve our respect and support. Latvia is also an excellent example of how clear political prospects for the future can strengthen and accelerate social and economic development. On 15 February 2000 the accession negotiations were formally opened. In the same year, growth of 6.6% in gross domestic product was achieved and in the first quarter of this year growth even reached 8.2%. These are just a few of very many other indicators which point to the opportunities – the opportunities to create political stability and economic dynamism – which enlargement brings.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question about the state of the shipbuilding industry in the Community is prompted by deep concern about the future of this sector. On the one hand, international competition remains extremely distorted. The market, which is characterised by artificially low prices, in particular from Korea, can still only be described as extremely anti-competitive. On the other hand, the demands made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 14 December of last year have so far, either, not been met at all, or, only to an insufficient extent. It remains unclear how the European shipbuilding industry can be supported so as further to improve its international competitiveness. It remains unclear how rigorously the Commission has responded to Parliament's call for a dispute settlement procedure to be initiated with the Republic of Korea before the World Trade Organisation. The decisions made so far in this respect by the Commission, and also by the Council, have been inconsistent and illogical in important areas. On the one hand, they have established that Korea has clearly violated the agreements made; on the other, they have so far neglected to take immediate and appropriate action against this. This can only be to the detriment of European shipyards. Only in May 2001, when the situation is examined more closely, will it be recognised that the Union's shipyards have been at the mercy of persistently unfair competition for almost half a year. This means additional burdens and dangers in an already complicated situation. It may be disastrous for individual companies. In this acute situation, competition is being distorted and livelihoods are being threatened, and the European Union risks suffering serious strategic damage if action is not taken more quickly and more systematically against obvious unfair practices. The course of events so far really does seem rather odd. Allow me to draw a comparison between this and a sporting competition. How do you think a competitor feels who has just recovered from a serious illness and is sent into the boxing ring? There he comes up against a tough opponent who, despite having been proven guilty of taking drugs several times, still has not been banned. On the contrary, the prizes are increasing. This is an opponent who already habitually hits below the belt, while the referee looks on indifferently and the judges argue about what the drug-taker's illegal punches are worth – full or half points!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures that have been taken and the position adopted by the Commission on the European shipbuilding industry do not, in my opinion, reflect the serious and indeed critical nature of the situation in that industry, and the same applies to the transactions and outcome of the meeting of industry ministers on 5 December. May I remind the House that the results of what has been a highly successful adjustment process are now being put at risk. We have had a process of quantitative adjustment, in which capacities have been reduced. We have had a process of qualitative adjustment, involving modernisation, the introduction of state-of-the-art technology and high productivity, and I can assure you, Commissioner, that shipyards are one of the areas where advanced technology is of the essence, not only information technology and related domains but production technology too. In short, a generally successful process is now being placed in extreme jeopardy. I also wish to remind you that many of our shipyards are in remote regions with structural weaknesses – regions that are undergoing radical adjustment processes. Shipbuilding is often the key industry in such regions. The process has not yet been completed, and the situation remains delicate. Insufficient progress has been made towards diversification; consistent adherence to the present course is essential. The line being followed by the Commission can only be detrimental to the shipyards of Europe. Further investigations are planned, but not until next year. So is the situation insufficiently clear? Have there not been enough detailed analyses? Have visits not been paid to Korea? Has the Commission not received unsatisfactory information? Is the present situation really so shrouded in mystery that we have to wait until May 2001 for a more detailed review? The Commission knowingly tolerates the exposure of the shipyards in the European Union to unfair competition for almost six months. This brings additional pressures and dangers to a situation that is already complicated. It will inevitably push individual companies over the edge. Allow me to make one final remark. It is surely the height of inconsistency to proclaim such dedication to free external trade that we are even prepared to tolerate an unfair partner and yet, at the same time, to maintain internal restrictions on competition such as the artificial ceiling on our shipbuilding capacity. Our internal and external policies are clearly at odds with each other, and this must be corrected.

Mr President, do excuse me for arriving late. Unfortunately, I am still at a loss as to how to find my way out of the maze of garages by the shortest route. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a problem that is largely to be found in the Baltic States, in particular Latvia and Estonia. It concerns the existence of a relatively large Russian-speaking ethnic group, supplemented by people from Ruthenia and the Ukraine. The vast majority of these people are there as a result of a decade of occupation, which is why they keep themselves very much to themselves. In the course of the last few years, it has been possible to bring about a distinct improvement in the situation, due in no small part to the influence of the European Institutions. I would remind you that only a few years ago, the language law contributed to the negative assessment. I would also ask you to cast your minds back to the great difficulties attending the nationality law, which had to be amended and tailored to European standards. These legal hurdles have now been overcome, as a result of which, many Russian-speaking citizens are now prepared to recognise the citizens’ rights and duties, both in Latvia and Estonia, which are the countries worst affected. It is a process that is having very mixed success, but it still inspires great hope, because it will mean that these citizens will also become citizens of the Union in the future, and will therefore be called upon, in a special way, to establish ties with their homeland, where their forefathers come from. I have a shrewd idea that these citizens will become agents of cross-border cooperation in a future enlarged European Union.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive is intended to replace 15 existing directives on the recognition of professional qualifications. The Commission has chosen a horizontal approach that carries the danger that all professional qualifications will be lumped together. That should not happen. Qualification dumping should be prevented on consumer protection grounds alone. We must ensure that training is of a high quality. The Committee is also concerned that cross-border service provision is to be facilitated by lowering the requirements for the standard of qualification of the service provider. Under the Commission’s proposal, any supplier who is lawfully established in a Member State will be allowed to provide services in another Member State on a temporary basis for 16 weeks in a year, without needing any authorisation or being subject to any controls. We were unable to agree to that. Service providers have to fulfil their duty both to the recipient of the service and to the authorities of the host Member State. That is the only way that control and protection mechanisms can have any effect. Especially sensitive activities must be subject to controls. The citizen cannot assess the quality of doctors or tax consultants for themselves, for example. He relies on the existence of the familiar tried and tested systems of training, qualification and authorisation. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs would also like to be sure that persons who, because of national regulations, are highly qualified professionals are not disadvantaged by comparison with those who have a low level of qualification but the same job title. It is, however, essential that the wording of the legislation does not call freedom of movement into question. We therefore welcome the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur Mr Zappalà, whom I congratulate on his balanced report, have found a compromise between a horizontal and a sectoral approach, ensuring that professional organisations were able to contribute their expertise in the transposition of the directive.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Posting of Workers Directive was enacted in 1996 with the aim of eliminating obstacles and uncertainties concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. It did this by providing greater legal certainty and making it possible to identify the working conditions that apply to workers temporarily working in a Member State other than the State whose legislation governs the employment relationship. As provided for in Article 8 of Directive 96/71/EC, in the current communication the Commission summarises the results of its review of the implementation of the Directive in the 15 Member States and of its practical application, in order to decide whether the Directive needs to be revised. The communication shows that implementation of the Directive has, generally speaking, been satisfactory, although it should be noted that the United Kingdom and Ireland have no specific implementing provisions and that Luxembourg was the last Member State to complete transposition, which it did only 13 months ago. I would like to reiterate that five years of highly problematic debates were needed before the Posting of Workers Directive was adopted in 1996. It has now been shown that difficulties have arisen, in that the directive requires the businesses to which it applies to comply with the laws of a State other than that in which they are established, laws which are sometimes not readily accessible or comprehensible. These problems need to be resolved at national level, as they are problems related to the transposition of the Directive into Member States’ legislation, which can result in difficulties in monitoring compliance with it. In its communication, the Commission summarises the problems involved in transposing and applying the Directive, which are more practical than legal in nature. It has, in consequence, set up a group of experts – made up of civil servants from the Member States – with the objective of finding solutions to the problems described, such as ways of improving access to, and exchange of, information on national rules and legislation or of collecting required information in a standard form. The Committee is still of the opinion that this directive is a necessary one, and expresses the hope that the problems brought to light may be speedily removed, particularly in view of the fact that, on 1 May this year, 10 new countries will be covered by the Directive. We have to ensure legal certainty for the workers posted by enterprises participating in the internal market. Furthermore, the Committee wishes to point out that it is essential that the implementation of the Directive be monitored in order to assess the effectiveness of the legislation, and that this will be made even more important by EU enlargement. It also calls upon the Commission to submit better and more concrete data on the implications of implementation at national level, to lay down clear definitions of such things as the status of employees, minimum wages and overtime and to prevent the improper posting of workers, which is a consequence of unfair competition and social dumping. We also call on the Commission to examine the provisions regulating liability in the case of subcontracting in with the Posting of Workers Directive. There is a need for comprehensive enquiries and surveys in the 15 – soon to be 25 – Member States if we are to have an exact picture of the situation that makes comparison possible. The Committee also believes that the Commission should support the group of experts and that this work should involve the collective bargaining partners, the European Parliament, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the social partners. The Committee calls upon the Commission to cooperate closely with the social partners in detailed research with the aim to producing proposals for the improvement and simplification of the present Directive, which must give especial priority to the effects of EU enlargement. As the large number of demands made upon the Commission and the Member States makes any delay undesirable, my view, as rapporteur, is that the demand made of the Commission by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that it submit a second report on the implementation of the Directive by the end of this year is not one that the Commission will be able to comply with. Although, for this reason, I am unable to endorse Amendment No 1, I do want to put the case for the Amendment No 4 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation.

 Commissioner, Mr President, the report on harassment at the workplace was adopted almost three years ago. Anyone who, like Mr Andersson and myself, has concerned themselves with this issue, will have discovered the depths to which people can sink in their dealings with one another. Of all workers in the EU, 8% say that they themselves have been affected by harassment. That is what is officially recorded; the true figure may well be many times higher. The report discusses in depth the causes and effects of bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace and the circumstances that lead to it. The extent to which violence and harassment occur in the workplace amounts to an extremely serious problem. As the report describes, they result in extreme physical and mental stress, to the extent of making people seriously ill. It has an effect even on people’s private lives, is a burden on social security funds and hampers general economic performance. Combating this problem is an extremely difficult undertaking. It will scarcely be possible to come up with a standard definition of the phenomenon. It was the Commission that was given the task of bringing to light other factors that encourage harassment; only when we have a clear picture of the true extent of the problem will we be able to take appropriate action to deal with it. Is the Commission able to comply with this request within the foreseeable future? It is my conviction that combating harassment at work is a matter for the Member States. The social partners, legislators at national level, educational institutions and associations need especial support in their efforts to combat it. It would make sense for there to be a European publicity campaign to put this problem centre stage and rouse the public in the EU. That might put a stop to their indifference. Harassment, whether sexual or not, is not a trifling offence; it is a crime the war on which must start where the crime is committed. This means that it is doubtful that any European directive would be effective, but can the Commission put forward proposals as to how individual efforts in the Member States might be supported?

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I originally wanted to say something about the nonsensical procedure that we are going through at this witching hour, but then I saw all the young people who have been listening attentively and with great concentration, and whom, in the meantime, we seem to have lost again. I hope somebody explained to them why it is ... (Interruption)
 … that there are so very few Members in the Chamber. That brings me back to the question of whether it makes sense to be here at this late hour. We few Members of this House here present know what we think. We have exchanged views in lengthy discussions in very in-depth preparatory meetings. It dishonours the rapporteur, who has invested so much zeal in this work, to have his words declaimed shortly before midnight to an almost empty Chamber. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses his report. I am grateful to Mr Pittella for his good cooperation. As the problems have been aired, let me draw your attention to just a few points. It is not acceptable for national ministers to rejoice when funds in Brussels are not drawn on. They may well be glad when a few million euros are returned to them and can be used for this or that other purpose, but if that happens, then the Structural Funds, which were set up to benefit the most needy regions in the EU, are failing in their purpose. When we analyse the way funds are administered, we cannot but note with a critical eye the re-emergence of old familiar problems. Although national co-financing creates great problems for some Member States, we have good reasons for wanting to hold fast to the principle of it; we should, on the other hand, abandon excessively complicated and extensive, even sometimes unnecessary requirements in the procedure as a whole. Simplification and clarity, too, can result in stringent and necessary monitoring and even make it easier. This is something for the Commission and the Member States to do. The excessively lengthy planning procedures mean that delays are virtually inevitable. The current state of affairs as regards the outflow of funds is disturbing, but surely no surprise to the actors involved. It will be no simpler after the European Union gains ten new members. That is why there is a need for coordination between the actors to be simplified in order to enable EU funds to be targeted and used in a rational way. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are a death sentence for those affected, most especially in the poor and the poorest countries of this world, but there is no longer any reason why anyone should have to die from malaria or tuberculosis. These and other infectious diseases can be cured by the use of effective medicines. Through the research programme, the European Union is contributing financially to the fight against these diseases and we can hope that this will give people suffering from AIDS in the developing countries a chance of getting effective and affordable medicines for their terrible affliction. The Committee on Budgets has given this report a unanimous welcome. We should, however, be clear that the provision of funding for the research programme will not in itself solve the problems. The misery of poverty, underdevelopment, the lack of education and political lack of interest encourage the spread of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This is where everyone in positions of responsibility must increase their commitment.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication and Mr Whitehead's report on the Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006 are quite crucial documents. In the EU's Member States, people are relying on Parliament constantly upholding the protection of consumers, which they regard as a very important, indeed crucial, element in the EU's internal market. In our homelands, the standard of consumer protection is an important yardstick for measuring the effectiveness of our work. Various committees have delivered their opinions. The Committee on Budgets had the task of examining and evaluating the financial statement for this Consumer Policy Strategy. Whilst it adopted the Commission communication, it proposed to the lead committee a number of regulatory adjustments. The Committee also regrets the fact that no attempt had already been made to evaluate or qualify the effects that the measures proposed by the strategy as submitted would have on our finances or on the Budget. The Committee furthermore points out that, if the measures envisaged in the strategy are, on being incorporated into the proposal for a new legal framework, to extend beyond 2006, the finances will have to be confirmed, either by an agreement on a new Financial Perspective, or by annual Budget resolutions. I therefore hope that time can still be found to make the necessary adjustments or to allow the proposed amendments to influence practical implementation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of intensive work, we can now vote for the first time in plenary on the draft directive on working conditions for temporary workers. Everyone involved has made great efforts to achieve the best possible solution for temporary workers, temporary work agencies and dynamic economic development in our EU Member States. Reaching this outcome was a difficult task. I would like to thank everyone who helped to ensure that we could present a fairly good compromise today. With around 10 million jobless and a shaky economy in the European Union, we must be sure that our well-meaning intention – to guarantee a basic level of social provision for temporary workers – does not paralyse an entire sector. It would be quite inappropriate to term 'temporary work' an atypical or even an unworthy form of working. Temporary work can help new recruits find a direction for the future, and it can help prevent employees who are particularly difficult to place from leaving the workforce, or assist them to return to work. My group attaches particular importance to flexibility in this sector. We must not create new bureaucratic hurdles, and temporary work must continue to be affordable for small companies too. Otherwise, the days of temporary agency work are numbered, leaving even more millions jobless in the European Union. If, when we vote tomorrow, we are guided by the principle of subsidiarity and the concept of pro-active economic development as a basis for more jobs, we will create more scope for the EU Member States to pursue their own courses towards flexible labour market development which does not conflict with appropriate protection for workers. The measures adopted in Germany with regard to temporary work lead to a dead-end. I hope we can create a more effective framework here.

 Madam President, the border regions adjoining the future Member States of the European Union need our undivided attention now and even more after enlargement. Everywhere, especially in my country, the border regions are marked by extremely high unemployment and dying villages and towns. Young people are leaving because they see no future there. The only way we can halt this negative trend is to support those regions, modernise the infrastructure, create transport links and make small and medium sized enterprises fit to meet the challenge. Because it is they who create the most jobs. If the EU and the Member States themselves encourage and support the border regions, which are suffering massive problems, and that help must include preventing low-wage dumping and unfair competition, then a sense of cross-border neighbourliness will grow and that will be to everyone’s advantage. The historic task of enlargement must succeed. We have no alternative.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been intending to discuss the problem of workplace harassment here in the European Parliament for some time. The debate has been a long time coming, for the question which has always arisen is this: is this House the right forum for this debate? Some members of my group reject the report because they believe that this is not a European issue. The majority will follow my recommendation and vote for the report, because it is indeed a Europe-wide issue and problem. Bullying exists in every country of the European Union, in all sectors, and even in the EU institutions themselves. It is a difficult issue. It is very embarrassing for many people, and a large number of cases go unreported because no one really wants to talk about it. Victims feel ashamed, exploited and stressed. Their distress often has a high cost, not only in terms of their own mental and physical health, but also economically: sick leave, medical and treatment expenses, a high staff turnover, lower productivity, a loss of quality and image for the company or institution, and therefore also a decline in the number of customers. Bullying causes all these problems. The dignity of every individual should not be upheld solely on paper and in the Basic Law, but also in our social relations. A little more respect and fairness and a little less egotism would probably make our debate about harassment unnecessary. European legislation is unsuitable as a means to address the causes of bullying and is likely to be ineffective. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for including my ideas in his report. Measures to tackle bullying should focus primarily on the Member State and actively include the social partners. It is in companies' own interests to ensure that these incidents do not occur within their organisations. Due to the difficulties in arriving at a precise definition, the Commission will not find it easy to draft its proposed Green Paper. However, there are a few models of good practice in tackling bullying here in the European Union, and I believe that everyone should learn from each other. Tasks must be assigned effectively to the most appropriate levels; this will also increase the desire to take action and ensure that this difficult issue is taken seriously.

 Mr President, the report before us is a position adopted by Parliament in response to a communication from the Commission on the problems associated with undeclared or illicit work. This problem is being dealt with at European level because it relates not just to one particular country but to all Member States. What is the heart of the problem? Major economic and socio-political damage is being caused in the Member States through work not being declared. Health insurances, pensions systems and the Treasury together lose billions every year. Workers are in no way insured or otherwise safeguarded. Thoughts of a modern slave trade with fatal consequences for those involved spring clearly and inevitably to mind. Those who are rewarded in some way for undeclared work have no right to claim compensation at all and no other consumer rights. The people concerned believe that they are at an advantage but are in fact harming only themselves and society. The fact is that, by definition and by its very nature, undeclared work is difficult to get to grips with in any country. On the basis of estimates and long-term investigations, it may be assumed that a total of 28 million people engage in undeclared work. The volume of undeclared work now corresponds to 15% of gross domestic product in the EU. The sector as a whole is growing three times as fast as the official economy. In the communication before this House, the Commission has problems with the analysis, as well as with the steps that need to be taken to stem the tide of undeclared work. Parliament has been working flat out on these problems for a long time and produced a list of causes which produce combined and many-sided effects. Almost all investigations list unduly high taxes and social security contributions as a cause. However, the Committee lists further causes such as poverty, frivolous bidding procedures, giveaway prices for subcontractors, inflexible employment legislation and poor administrative practice, as well as a clear decline in the perception of undeclared work as something illegal and illicit. In drawing its conclusions, the Committee has, however, come up with a variety of positions derived from the very different evaluations of the various causes. I nonetheless believe that we are united as to our goal. It is only the path about which we disagree. The conclusions adopted by the Committee at its last sitting call for as precise as possible an assessment to be made of the sectors affected and of the most significant groups of people involved, as well as for the social partners to be involved in active measures to combat undeclared work and for the issue to be tackled in national employment programmes. They also call for surveillance and for sanctions to be imposed when undeclared work is detected. However, a majority of the Committee considers a reduction in tax and social security contributions to be crucial as a preventive measure, as well as a reduction in value added tax in the case of labour-intensive services, as already provided for by the Council’s decision of 28 February of this year and as also already practised in new countries. It is also important to find solutions in hitherto unsatisfactory areas, for example in connection with the directive on the posting of workers and with the paid domestic work largely performed by women. In the five minutes granted to me, I can present only a number of important points in the report. The problem is complex and needs to be tackled at a variety of levels. The Committee therefore calls upon the Commission and the individual Member States, each according to its powers but above all with firm determination, to take up Parliament’s proposals and to become active in this matter. I hope that we can demonstrate to you our substantial agreement with the report, together with Parliament’s active resolve. I would thank all my fellow MEPs for their splendid cooperation but, above all, the shadow rapporteur, Karin Jöns, for her constant readiness to engage in discussion. Finally, I would draw your attention to a printing error. In Article 25 of the conclusions, the Committee has clearly formulated the right to a class action. This needs to be revised in the latest text we have before us. The words ‘appeals to the courts’ must therefore be deleted and replaced with the words ‘a class action’. The words then correctly correspond to the will of the Committee, as agreed. Many thanks for your attention. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I would like to say, as draftsperson of my Committee’s opinion, is that, where regional policy and the Structural Funds are concerned, most of the countries should, by the time they accede, already be in a position to transpose core areas of the acquis
. It is to be regretted, though, that all of them need to make greater efforts in such important areas as financial management and financial control. In the transport sector, it is the failure of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to make progress in road transport that is most disappointing of all. Further decisive action has to be taken to raise safety and environmental standards and to ensure conformity with the acquis
. As the trans-European transport networks are of great importance to the whole of Europe, not only the accession states, but also the Fifteen in the EU, need to be urged to regard the TENs not merely as a means of realising national priorities, but as making a contribution to European cohesion and to the integration of a reunited Europe.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the way in which Mrs Kauppi, in her revised report, has moved away from her negative stance. Mrs Kauppi, you are quite right to say that the Commission proposal leaves room for improvement, but I cannot be satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the lead committee, which rejected it. With this proposal for harmonising the taxation of diesel fuel used for commercial purposes, the Commission has taken a courageous step in the right direction, one in which the lead committee was not prepared to join it, thus ignoring the recommendations in its favour in the opinions of the advisory committees. In essence, the Commission proposal has two ends in mind. It envisages disentangling the tax rules on fuels, for commercial purposes on the one hand and for private use on the other, and, secondly, duties on diesel fuel in commercial use are to be harmonised, the object being to avoid distortions of competition. Competition, though, is distorted not only when rates of duty are not harmonised, but also because drivers work and drive for different periods of time. That should not, however, be a reason to reject the proposal, but rather a reason for improving it. After all, Parliament has always encouraged and endorsed measures aimed at opening up markets and making competition fair. Harmonisation is, moreover, intended to avoid the customary detours and the damage to the environment that results from them. It cannot be denied that ‘gasoline tourism’ is commonplace nowadays, and it is partly responsible for the damage to the environment. So how do things now stand with the outcome? Firstly, it does not get to grips with the alignment of competition conditions in the transport business, which is so urgently needed. Secondly, this decision amounts to a retrograde step in terms of environmental policy as well. This is lamentable, and it is my belief that it would have made sense, particularly at the present time, for the Commission to improve its proposal in order to tackle the deplorable state of affairs to which I have referred.

Mr President, Commissioner Reding, I would like to congratulate Mrs de Sarnez on her excellent report and thank her once again for her cooperation. The Erasmus Mundus Programme can only be passionately supported. On the one hand, the programme’s added value consists in the possibility of mobility, in the learning of foreign languages as well as in intercultural exchanges. On the other hand, Erasmus Mundus accepts, in a pro-active and constructive way, the educational challenges of globalisation. It is precisely because the programme is open to students from third countries that Europe can distinguish itself further in the field of higher education. In an age of globalisation, there is competition for the best products, the best ideas and last but not least, for the best brains. It is for this reason that Europe must make itself more attractive and competitive as a place of study and education. As draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the first reading of the report in April 2003, I too am particularly pleased today to see that Parliament has notched up one significant success. With EUR 230 million instead of the proposed EUR 180 million, Erasmus Mundus will have a sound financial basis. After all, what can sensible programmes achieve if they are not adequately funded? What we have achieved is creditable, but the current commitments and the new initiatives are altogether inadequate when set against the Lisbon objectives. When money is tight and budgetary resources limited, we cannot expect to reach dizzy heights, but nor should money being tight and limited budgetary resources be excuses for preventing us from making farsighted political commitments. Ladies and gentlemen, education is the number one investment in the future. Do we want to have the most dynamic and most competitive economic area in the world by 2010? If so, then we have to get our priorities right by investing in research and training, and Erasmus Mundus is a step in the right direction.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is about nothing less than the future of European cohesion policy after 2006. My thanks also go to Messrs Mastorakis and Pomés Ruiz for their outstanding work. Promoting economic and social cohesion must be given top priority, particularly in an enlarged Union. The discrepancies between richer and poorer regions will be much greater in the Union of 25. The past has shown, however, how meaningful programmes under European regional policy can make an important contribution to creating similar living conditions. It is obvious that in the future it is precisely the regions in the acceding countries that will be in receipt of European aid, because it is in regional policy that we actually see Europe in action and catch a glimpse of European solidarity. As a Member from Saxony, I know what it has been possible to achieve thanks to European solidarity in eastern Germany, in Saxony. That is why I can only welcome the Commission's talk in the Second progress report of a just settlement for the 18 regions in the current Member States that would be caught by the statistical effect. I do not need to convince you that just because the regions are calculated to be rich from a statistical point of view does not mean that their structural problems are resolved. That is why it is not only a just but also a robust solution that needs to be found for the 18 regions concerned. Special transitional arrangements must make it possible for them to be treated in the future if not as Objective 1 areas then at least as similar to Objective 1 areas and to have their aid administered accordingly. Only in this way will the funds that they have received hitherto pay dividends in the long term and not prove to have been worthless.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her excellent report and thank her for her good and constructive cooperation. The Erasmus Welt programme, which is so important to the future of the European Union, shows how important and sensible it is that Parliament's committees should cooperate well with the Commission. The Commission proposal is supplemented by the amendments tabled to it, which also put it on a broader foundation, especially in financial terms, with EUR 300 million instead of the proposed EUR 200 million. New programmes, especially in the fields of education, culture and youth, which represent important investments in our future, raise again and again the key issue of where we are meant to get the money from if there is none under the heading provided for that purpose. Where is the money supposed to come from if we are disinclined to cut back other similar programmes under the same heading? This question has to be put and answered in this plenary more than once, and I can see the same problem arising with Mr Mauro's report on eLearning. Our Parliament has the traditional policy of defending existing programmes. In its legislative capacity, the Council can indeed see how important these programmes are, but as a budgetary authority, it is unwilling to allocate more funds to Heading 3. The current Financial Perspective, which still has until the end of 2006 to run, leaves an extremely small amount of foreseeable room for manoeuvre. That will, in any case, affect the first three years of the Erasmus World programme. The Lisbon strategy, though, which we are pursuing, might well make this a good opportunity for us to show our colours. What priorities do we want to set for the distribution of the funds available, if we want to achieve the transformation into a competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based society, as was reaffirmed, yet again, by everyone at the Brussels Summit just over two weeks ago? With this in mind, we should be putting the case for this important new programme to receive appropriate funding, to the tune of EUR 300 million. Let me then repeat my urgent appeal to the Council to join with us in looking forward and going ahead with this. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I have to reiterate that the present situation will very probably result in a redeployment of the funds under Heading 3 in order to guarantee compliance with the financial upper limit. It might make sense, in the first instance, to reallocate funds from those action programmes for which no financial framework has yet been laid down in the Financial Perspective, or for which such a framework is to be decided on by way of codecision after 2007.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 2004 will be the European Year of Education through Sport. Sport has been since time immemorial a favoured, successful and effective means of influencing, in a fundamentally positive way, educational policy and the educational values that underlie our life together in society. The promotion of sport and the partnership between sporting and educational facilities has a positive effect on teamwork, tolerance, solidarity, the campaign against drugs and violence, and on fair and healthy competition without recourse to doping. These are values that need to be rediscovered and promoted. This makes the choice of 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport, and against the backdrop of the Olympic Games and Paralympics in Athens and the European football tournament in Portugal, very much to be welcomed. The Commission is proposing a total of EUR 11.5 million to finance it, EUR 3.5 million of which are to be paid towards operational expenditure in 2003, the year when preparations for it get underway, and EUR 8 million in 2004. The proposed financial framework must be compatible with the upper limit laid down in the Financial Perspective and must not be allowed to result in cutbacks in other areas. For reasons of efficiency and for the avoidance of unnecessary administrative costs, a coordinating body should be provided for in each Member State. There is, in my view, no need for a formal requirement to consult a group of as yet unspecified experts who would decide on the financing or cofinancing of individual measures. Administration and evaluation of the programme should remain a public matter, that is, one for the Commission. The decision on the European Year of Sport is the right one, but it is continuity that brings success. This splendid scheme thoroughly deserves to be continuously developed, signifying as it does an investment in our young people growing up to be healthy and able to contribute to the integration of a healthy and united Europe. This investment in our future will pay dividends, for our young people are our future!

Madam President, I was unfortunately prevented from being here this morning and will therefore sum up our position on the Socrates, Youth and Culture 2000 programmes. The rationale behind the choice of these programmes can be traced back to the decisive consideration that the programmes in question are surely the Community's most important support programmes in the fields of education, youth, and European culture. Being aware of the importance of these specific areas, Parliament has, moreover, let itself be guided by the allocation of substantial funding and the recent extension into 2006. Nor should we forget the legislative processes initiated by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. We explicitly welcome the formation of an evaluation group, whose objective must be to closely supervise Parliament's implementation of Community programmes. We welcome the initiative taken in forming the evaluation group as well as that to extend this control machinery on the basis of new instruments and appropriate structures. We also emphasise that it is heavy demand from within the Member States that has led to the Socrates, Youth, and Culture 2000 programmes being allocated additional resources. We had to take note of the fact that the programmes' low level of implementation during 2000 was attributable to lengthy and cumbersome internal procedures. Parliament therefore expects the Commission to guarantee more efficient implementation, not least in order to help Europe's credibility in the eyes of its citizens and taxpayers. It is with concern that we observe bottlenecks, especially within the centralised management framework. Here of all places, attention should be paid to the utilisation of financial assets. It is a significant step in the right direction to further decentralise the administration of the programme, yet, thinking in terms of a united Europe, we must not forget that, as regards the determining of the programmes' political orientation, the sole competence of the institutions must be guaranteed.

 Mr President, I should like to correct you. I believe that the Minutes will show that my colleague Mr Pirker has given up his two minutes so that I have four minutes. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the eastern enlargement of our European Union on 1 May, to what are now 25 countries did not happen overnight, but was a ten-year-long process, which demanded an enormous amount both of the old European Union as well as of the new Member States. In the area of justice and home affairs, many citizens of the old EU Member States were afraid of a higher crime rate after enlargement. Here, however, the accession negotiations, as well as an enormous amount of cooperation on the part of the new Member States themselves, have enabled us to achieve a great deal. Who would have thought, ten years ago, that one day German and Polish border guards would together control their borders in joint teams? The new Member States were also very successful in the area of combating national crime, and so the old Member States often had to abandon their prejudices. Faced with more and more further threats, specifically from international terrorism, we must, in the future, act even more as Europeans. After the attacks of 11 September in New York, we saw what was, unfortunately, a one-off advance in our common justice and home affairs policy, with a great deal decided on in record time: the European Arrest Warrant, a single definition of terrorism, which included a framework for penalties and the freezing of all funds for terrorist purposes. Unfortunately, after just a year, interest was already waning and we in this House did not even manage to strengthen the Europol structure for combating terrorism. Once again, nations went it alone, and national plotting came to the fore; only after the tragic Madrid bombings did the issue once again appear at the top of our agenda. In the Council, the position of Terrorism Coordinator was quickly created, unfortunately without any real powers. The measures that we adopted after 11 September 2001 – that is, almost two and a half years ago – have still not been implemented in the Member States. The upshot is that Parliament and the European Union have done our homework but the Member States have not and so the next important questions are already on the agenda for a now enlarged Union. Our visa policy must be harmonised and must include the creation of a visa information system. Border protection standards must be unified and controlled by a European border protection agency and the second generation Schengen Information System must finally be completed. Europol must be even more closely involved in the national fight against crime and be given more manpower, and we urgently need the European Public Prosecutor, in order to effectively combat the defrauding of the European Union. Within this framework, the new Member States must take even more decisive action against corruption than has been the case to date. Cooperation with third countries must also be stepped up since terrorism must be combated, not just in Europe, but also across the world. We have, in this legislative period, achieved a number of things for the safety of European citizens. A great deal fell through, though, as a result of the need for unanimity in the Council and because of national egoisms. This is why there is hardly a content area for which the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty is so important as that of justice and home affairs policy. The EU of 25 Member States will in future only be in a position to effectively combat terrorism and organised crime if we implement simpler and more transparent procedures. The Council in particular must change over to majority voting. In addition, whilst this Treaty is in place, the budget should be significantly increased, since not just agriculture and economic structures, but also safety, cost money. To this end, I hope for constructive and specially focused cooperation in the newly elected Parliament. You deserve our thanks, Commissioner Vitorino. We did not always agree on asylum issues, but we always gave you great support where justice and home affairs policy was concerned and I hope it was this that brought forth applause from the Left, since that shows that in the future we will be in a position to act together and be stronger than we were before.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recently wanted to fly to China. In order to do this, I had to apply for a visa and provide a whole array of highly personal details. As well as flying from Frankfurt to Peking, I was planning to take a connecting flight with a Chinese airline from Peking to Guilin, and this involved some of the data being transferred from one airline to another, a process that enables the Chinese state to get its hands on a plethora of personal data. I have to tell Mrs Lambert that I am unaware of there being any sort of data protection law in China, nor can I ask who there is storing my data, or which data are stored for any particular purpose; I cannot ask for it to be corrected, contact the Chinese data protection supervisor or take the government to court. Despite that, we are not banning flights to China or demanding general agreements. Now there is, I know, a great difference involved here, in that, when you fly to the United States, their system can directly access or ‘pull’ your data, rather than it being ‘pushed’ over to them, so that the United States have direct access to our systems; they are not limited to the data that we forward to them. Let me add, Commissioner, that the demands we are making now bear no relation to some sort of wish list; this is European data protection legislation, in black and white. The obligation is now on you to switch over to a ‘push’ system. What I would like is a response from you, and right now. Failing that, I appeal for more calm. The fact that different standards of data protection prevail does not mean that citizens’ rights are under threat. The United States has a legitimate interest in this instance, that being in the defence of their country. I doubt whether other countries could claim the same, even though they disregard our data protection legislation. I might add, ladies and gentlemen, that I never got to China, because I had not submitted my visa information in good time. Unfortunately, I had no legal remedy against that either.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council intends to establish a border protection agency. This House has developed an alternative model, but we all know that the Council will disregard it. Above all, I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Committee on Budgets to the fact that this agency, in addition to the 27 staff working there, is also to be controlled by 27 members of the Management Board and also by an Executive Board consisting of five members. The Commission and the Council really are creating a bureaucratic monster here! I wish to ask the Committee on Budgets, before it approves the funding for this agency, to enter into a further in-depth discussion with the Council. No matter how much we support progress in this field, we simply cannot work like this in Europe. I hope the Committee on Budgets will back us on this. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the interests of all the Member States that the EU’s external borders should be secured. Whereas Austria, Germany and the Benelux states will soon have no EU external border of their own to defend, Italy alone has 7 600 km of maritime frontier to police, half of it in the Adriatic and the southern Mediterranean. Europe must not leave either Italy or the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe to perform this task alone, and it must also establish common standards. By producing this proposal to establish a European Agency for Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, the Commission is now, at last, responding to a long-standing demand by this House. As long ago as 1998, Mr Posselt’s report called for protection of the EU’s external borders to be put on a Community basis, a demand described to our committee by Commissioner Verheugen in April 2002 as superfluous. Now at last, the Commission is taking action, belatedly, almost too late in the day, as enlargement is two months away. We in this House are regularly underwhelmed by proposals for the setting up of EU agencies, for an immense number of new ones is currently sprouting like weeds all over Europe, fragmenting the Commission’s competences and scarcely under control. We do, however, welcome the establishment of this one, it being a first step towards putting the defence of the external borders on a Community footing and consequently transferring competences to the European level. That, unfortunately, is only part of the story; as always, the devil is in the detail. Let me start with the substance of the proposal made by the Commission in November 2003. The Agency is meant to coordinate the Member States’ operational collaboration, to give backup in the training of officials, to carry out risk analyses and to monitor developments in research. It is not clear to the committee why the agency should also coordinate the return of third-country nationals illegally residing in the Member States; such a role makes no sense unless there are uniform standards, about which the Council of Ministers has so far been engaged in fruitless dispute. The Agency was also intended to concentrate on guarding borders rather than on other tasks. The Agency has, however, been denied another core competence. Only much later is consideration to be given to the possibility of transferring to the Agency the right to carry out inspections on the external borders. Why is this so? The Agency is even now meant to be evaluating the outcomes of joint actions and carrying out extensive analyses. How is it meant to do this if it is unable to be present on the spot to get a picture of how things are on the ground? Competences are being established here without the machinery to monitor them, and this will bring inefficiency in its wake. Our committee demands that we should not completely lose sight of the option of a joint border guard structure. The Agency must at least have the task of examining whether such a body is needed. The worst thing about this agency, though, is its structure. Commissioner Vitorino, I can tell you that there is not one expert who believes that an agency of this sort can even begin to function with a staff of 27; it will need at least double the number of staff – between 45 and 50 of them. Your proposal is that the Management Board should consist of twelve members appointed by the Council and two representatives of the Commission, and that they would choose the Executive Director. In so doing, you evade your own responsibility. Why does the Management Board not have an equal number of members appointed by the Commission and the Council respectively, and why is the position of Executive Director not to be publicly advertised in the same way as the posts of other heads of important EU authorities? We want the Agency to have close ties to the Commission, for who, after all, is supposed to monitor the Agency if the Commission has no responsibility for it? The parliaments of the 25 Member States, perhaps? On the contrary, ladies and gentlemen, if anyone is to monitor it, it must be the body that provides the funds, and that means us. This structure is an evasion of responsibility on your part, and the ongoing debate in the Council shows where that leads. It now has a new document as a basis for discussion, to which we have still not, officially, had access and about which you, Commissioner, have had nothing to say this evening; nor, indeed, did your official tell the committee anything about it. That the Council should disregard our right to be consulted is nothing new, but it is unheard of that the Commission should aid and abet it in doing so. The new proposal envisages all the Member States being represented on the Management Board; having 25 board members for 27 staff members makes Europe look ridiculous. By way of compromise, an additional Executive Board is to be set up, with just five members. This is bureaucracy gone mad; just ask the border guards on the ground, Commissioner. They want more European competences and more support, and they are less intimidated by the European institutions than you are. To sum up, then, the opposite of ‘well-meant’ is ‘badly done’. Although we welcome the Agency, it cannot function if it is along the lines you propose. Now it is my colleague Mr Coelho’s turn to speak. I am sure he will enlarge on what I have said.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow on directly from Mr Turco's speech and respond to it with my own thanks. In this instance, we agreed on a common approach, one that would involve rejecting the Danish and Greek initiatives and adopting our own recommendation on Europol's future development, but, despite the common draft, our arguments do of course differ to some extent. It is the case that, in the past, we in the European Parliament made matters easy for ourselves by rejecting every proposal for amending the Europol Convention. Our justification for doing so was the lack of democratic and judicial control over Europol, for, belonging as it does to the third pillar, Europol has hitherto not been subject either to parliamentary control by the European Parliament or to judicial control by the European Court of Justice, whilst the national parliaments mainly had no interest in controlling it either. There were a number of extensions of Europol's competences that we in the European Parliament were unwilling to agree to without increased powers of control. The Danish proposal, though, on which I am reporting, contains precisely this increase in Parliament's opportunities for control, in that, according to it, Parliament is to be consulted on numerous issues, including the collection, processing and utilisation of personal data, the transmission of data to third states, the establishment of rules on secrecy and the protection of confidentiality in relation to personal status and, finally, any amendment of the Europol Convention as well. Even the proposed facility whereby national authorities should in future be able to communicate directly with Europol would be a real step forward. It strikes me, for a start, that it would not make sense to reject all this, and, even though this has been the line we have taken in the past as a matter of principle, I considered welcoming the proposal, on the grounds that it should be seen in the context of the debate in the Convention, where, at this time, Working Group X had proposed the dissolution of the European Union's third pillar – Justice and Internal Affairs – and the transfer of Europol to the first pillar. This would entail both judicial control by the European Court of Justice and parliamentary control by way of the European Parliament's budgetary rights. Seen in this light, then, it initially made sense to anchor a consultation procedure in the Europol Convention. Now, though, the proposals put forward by the Convention presidium have caught up with the Danish initiative, something for which thanks are especially owed to Commissioner Vitorino. I will be honest, Commissioner, and concede that I did not at first think it possible that the Convention would indeed bring itself to make Europol subject to a codecision procedure, to be termed in future a legislative procedure, with equal rights for Parliament and for the Council, but what I asked for at the end of each of my previous speeches has now been granted. In this area, the Convention has indeed demonstrated courage. Whilst, when I consider the amendments tabled by members of the Convention, I do find a few asking for the Council to reach unanimous decisions in this area, I can find not one single amendment intended to curtail the role envisaged for the European Parliament. That being so, we can assume a broad consensus, and so the Danish initiative, with the consultation procedure it contains, can be shelved. It is, nonetheless, possible to make improvements to the presidium's proposals. For a start, the Council's authority to draw up guidelines should be done away with, as, secondly, should Article 9's restriction on control by the Court of Justice. Thirdly, in general terms, unanimity in the Council in matters concerning Europol, as requested by a number of members of the Convention, is something to be rejected. Fourthly, the legislative procedure must make it possible for Europol to conduct its own investigations, in collaboration with the appropriate officials in the Member States. Such a transfer of competences could, in the first instance, also be subject to unanimity, although Parliament's rights must under no circumstances be curtailed. Fifthly, Europol must also be able to act in defence of the EU's financial interests when asked to do so by Eurojust or of the Public Prosecutor yet to be appointed as part of it. This is where cooperation with this institution must be regulated in even more precise terms; it must not be left to internal agreements, as was the case before. Sixthly, control by Eurojust will be meaningful only when Europol has had real executive powers handed over to it, for, until they have been, the fact that Europol remains subject to the control of national public prosecutors will result in structures being duplicated. The seventh point is that Europol must be given access to the various computer systems – among which I will mention only the Schengen Information System, the Customs Information System, and Eurodac – which are to be united in one single uniform computer system with different entitlements to access it. My eighth point follows on from this. Europol has to have standardised data protection along the lines of Directive 46/95, and it needs simple language rules. Last but not least, the requirement that the Member States cooperate with Europol needs to be enforced more strictly. Many Member States are still sending Europol too few data or none at all. We now urge the Council not to go on blocking the use of EU Budget resources to fund Europol in its counter-terrorist activities until such time as the Intergovernmental Conference has adopted such a constitutional treaty. The public cannot be persuaded that their security suffers when the Interior Ministers feel that their competences have been trespassed upon. In any case, the Convention leaves room for a generous interpretation. At the same time, the Council must make preparations for the Europol Convention to be carried over into legislation. It is now for all of us to ensure that the Convention is a success. I believe, indeed, that our success is predestined, for without these advances we will, in the long term, fail in our attempts to combat crime in Europe. So, today too, I will end with words that even Mr Coelho will endorse: by the way, it is my opinion that the Convention must be even more courageous.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Theato. Many thanks, Diemut, above all for your readiness to compromise. I am glad that in the end a compromise was found between those who wanted to see a European Public Prosecutor close to the Commission and those who did not want a European Public Prosecutor at all. The Theato report now makes quite clear that such a Public Prosecutor will only exist in connection with Eurojust, only as a position at Eurojust. That makes sense because a European Public Prosecutor working separately would otherwise have to confront the same problems as national public prosecutors in cross-border prosecutions. We will shortly have 25 national legal codes, 25 codes of criminal procedure, 25 legal systems and 21 languages in this enlarged European Union. Such coordination would require an enormous new apparatus. Alternatively, we could avoid duplication by simply relying on Eurojust. That also means, however, that the actual charge must be brought before national courts by national public prosecutors. That therefore means that a European Public Prosecutor merely prepares a case. And it must also be made perfectly clear here that we are limiting the Public Prosecutor’s powers to the protection of the European Union’s financial interests. We must therefore say a clear no to a general European Public Prosecutor for all serious cross-border crime, such as the Presidium of the Convention is currently proposing, because there is nothing to be gained by it. In other areas, trials fail not out of lack of interest on the part of national public prosecutors, as is the case with the financial protection of the European Union, but mostly as a result of language barriers and legal problems. We cannot harmonise everything in this Union, however. We cannot, for example, harmonise criminal law, criminal procedure, the training of public prosecutors or the court system. In these areas we can only coordinate. That is why I would like to send a clear signal to the Convention again here: a Public Prosecutor to protect the financial interests of the European Union – Yes; a general European Public Prosecutor to fight crime – No.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for Baroness Ludford's question, which, being comprehensive in its scope, was a very good one. I cannot do other than endorse the rapporteur's constitutional thinking on the subject of asylum and immigration policy. We need majority voting in the Council, Parliament needs to have the power of codecision, and the right of the Member States to propose legislation needs to be limited, as it is mainly used for reasons of domestic policy and rarely advances the cause of European Union. She is also right in her conclusion that the EU is a long way from implementing what was decided at Tampere. Whilst Baroness Ludford regards the Council as being to blame for this, I take the contrary view that the Commission must shoulder a large share of the responsibility for it. Commissioner Vitorino, although the Treaties require minimum standards of you, you wanted to go ahead and generously broaden the scope of both the Convention on Refugees and the provisions of national law, and your attempts to do so failed at Council level on many occasions. It might be a good idea if you were to slowly learn the error of your ways; your new proposal on the reunification of families certainly gives us hope that you are willing to do so. It so happens, Baroness Ludford, that minimum standards are often the lowest common denominator. The Group of the European People's Party welcomes the Commission's commitment to combating illegal immigration, which demonstrates, Commissioner Vitorino, that you can see that there are two sides to the coin and that you are getting down to work. Let us turn to counter-terrorism, an area in which 2002 has seen great progress made. The common definition of terrorism, the European arrest warrant, and the reinforcement of Europol were important milestones on the road towards terrorism being effectively combated in Europe. I would like to take this opportunity to specifically call upon the Council to make use of the funds we have allocated to Europol, which amount to over EUR 3 million, for if they do not do so, nobody will be in a position, in the event of one or more attacks in Europe, to coordinate or to lead police operations. Your disputes about competence will not, at any rate, meet with much public sympathy. Baroness Ludford has diagnosed an imbalance between the methods of counter-terrorism on the one hand and guaranteed fundamental rights on the other. I do not see that such is the case. Laws at national and European level have made very good provision for data protection, we have extensive systems for defence and legal protection, and direct intervention can, of course, still only be carried out at national level. She is right, however, to demand that Europol and Eurojust – which latter has had a successful start – should be brought within the Community sphere, for that, in the long term, is the only way to guarantee effective democratic and juridical control and to prevent duplication of structures. It is clear to see that, if Eurojust were to be brought within the Community sphere, it could take over OLAF's tasks as well as ensuring that the Community's financial interest was protected. As well as that, though, the Schengen Agreement and its associated information system have to be brought within the Community sphere. I might add, by the way, that the plethora of information systems will function effectively only when they are interconnected and equipped with standard rules on data protection, which could also be monitored by the new data protection commissioner. At the same time, we also need a new coordination body for the external borders, by which I mean a sort of ‘Eurobord’ or ‘Euroguard’. Open internal borders mean that it is in the interest of all Member States that Poland's eastern border, the waters of the Italian Adriatic, and the Straits of Gibraltar should be secured, and this calls for solidarity on their part. I might add that the EU has wasted years of valuable time when it comes to these matters, which are closely connected with its own enlargement. For far too long, Commissioner Verheugen has been lulling the EU to sleep and reassuring it that no reforms are needed. The second generation SIS has now been delayed, and frameworks for common border control are also only in their early stages – all this with enlargement one year away. These are issues where we have to work, even now, much more closely with the candidate countries than we have done before. We all have a long road ahead of us before we can present the Europe of freedom, security and justice to its citizens, but we have to take the first steps, and, Commissioner, let me add that the Convention has to become even more courageous.

 Madam President, the Committee on Petitions gets a number of submissions to do with the lack of opportunities for immigration into Europe, and this is another reason why a directive on the subject is needed. Commissioner Vitorino, you are also right to say that, following this directive's entry into force, it will be left to the Member States to decide whether they want immigration, and if so, how much of it. But, by this proposal for a directive, you are putting down a marker to the effect that ‘immigration is a right.’ You, on Thursday, will not be returning to a country in which, at present, 4.6 million people are unemployed. Or, to put the question another way, are there schools in Portugal in which half the children do not understand Portuguese? It is true that we need rules on legal immigration, and that we have to control it, but it is also the case that our problems with the economy and education mean that we lack appropriate jobs for our own fellow-citizens. Despite its few tentative good points, the signal you are sending out by means of this directive is the wrong one, and it is being sent at the wrong time. For example, you also intend to grant a third-country national the right to immigrate even if he reveals the existence of a job that has been vacant for four weeks, and you, Mrs Terrón i Cusí, with your three-week period, want to undercut this proposal. This reminds me of a motor race in a James Dean film, in which the contest is to see who will be the last to jump out of a car heading for a precipice. Incidentally, the film's German title translates as ‘They know not what they do’. Despite high unemployment in Germany, there are still at present many positions that remain unfilled. One of the reasons for this is that the education system has been run into the ground. What you are now saying is, ‘do not worry about reforming your own country's educational system – we shall just get immigrants to do the jobs.’ – but that cannot be the solution! So let me repeat: the proposal is well-intentioned, but it sends the wrong signal, and, by the way, as you know, Commissioner, I take the view that the Convention has to be even bolder.
von Boetticher (PPE-DE

 Mr President, when Commissioner Verheugen reported to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the subject of eastward enlargement, I put two questions to him. The first was whether the Commission regarded a common framework for border control as necessary; and the second was whether the Commission believed that the candidate countries would be in a position to secure their borders with countries outside the EU to the same high standard of protection as the existing Member States already did. The Commissioner's reply was that the candidate countries would have no problem with guaranteeing a satisfactory level of protection on their own, and that there was no need for a European approach. The Commission has now changed its mind and presented a sensible proposal for a common framework for control of our external borders. Mr Pirker's report supports it and adds to it at various points, and Mr Coelho is unfortunately no longer here to hear me say that it goes without saying that I wholeheartedly support it too. It is to be regretted that Commissioner Verheugen has wasted a lot of valuable time by talking rubbish. One example of why this is a matter of urgency is the border between Germany and Poland, 456 kilometres long and formed by a river, where traffic across it is at present monitored by some 10 000 border guards. Poland's border with its non-EU neighbours is over 1 200 kilometres long and runs across fields for the whole of its length. The belief that, within the next few years, Poland will be able to secure this border on its own in anything like the same way as external borders used to be secured, is utterly illusory. This is where European solidarity is needed, as the defence of the external borders by a number of Member States is to the ultimate benefit of all Member States. Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands reap the benefits of a high level of external border control. Any European concept of external border control must, at the end of the day, be enshrined in the Treaties, both by the allocation of combined powers to the EU and, on the other hand, by giving it institutional form as a European body in parallel with Europol and Eurojust. And, in these present times, as Cato did in the senate of ancient Rome, I will end all my speeches with the same words: Commissioner Vitorino, I wish that the Convention would demonstrate greater courage in this area.
von Boetticher (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish initiative and Mr Coelho's report represent the fulfilment of a longstanding parliamentary demand. Europol and Eurojust are now at last to be given the right to access the Schengen Information System, something that in the light of new threats from organised criminality and terrorism is also an urgent necessity. It is also a real step forward that invitations to tender can be collated. In his report, Mr Coelho addresses the issues and problems relating to data protection and puts forward well-reasoned proposals for resolving them. His report therefore deserves wholehearted support. As this House's former rapporteur on the development of the second-generation Schengen Information System, I would like to take this opportunity to again urge the Commission and the Council to act with speed. Mr Coelho himself has already pointed out that access will be able to be extended to certain persons or bodies only in conjunction with this new generation. This development must be complete by 2006 at the latest, and even that is actually two years too late, because, as we all know, the eastward enlargement is to be accomplished in 2004. We do, though, have to think further ahead. There are indications that the Convention will dispense with the existing three-pillar model of the European Union, and I say that it is right to do so, as it was the intergovernmental ‘justice and home affairs’ pillar that originally caused the data protection problem that we are discussing. The application of fifteen different sets of national data protection rules within Europol and Eurojust is even now leading to chaos. In addition, a lack of parliamentary and judicial oversight has resulted in a democratic deficit such as would make Montesquieu turn in his grave. The Convention's Working Party X has now, quite rightly, proposed that Europol be incorporated into the Community sphere, but, Commissioner Vitorino, that will not be enough. What is needed is the complete incorporation of the Schengen Agreement as well as of Europol and Eurojust into the Community sphere, and the establishment of what one might call 'Eurobord', an additional coordinating body for the external borders. Under this one roof we need a unitary system, combining the Schengen Information System, the customs information system and the Europol database, that is subject to European data protection and monitored by a European Data Protection Commissioner, by Parliament and by the European Court of Justice. Let me just say something to the left-wingers in this House. I see that Mr Krarup is here. Mr Krarup, you are opposed to the Schengen Information System and would like to see it abolished. This is all I have to say to that: anyone who concerns himself with the fate of refugees and stands up for them, whilst at the same time ignoring the fact that there are also criminals and lawbreakers outside Europe, has the misfortune to live in a dream world and takes an irresponsible, not to say unscrupulous attitude towards our people. You will not get a majority in this House! Mr Coelho's report, which we are adopting today, is a step in the right direction, but it is the Convention that will have to make the great leaps. For that, Commissioner, we wish you every success and perhaps a little more courage than you have hitherto demonstrated!

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to confine myself to making a few comments to the Commission. As you know, a year ago the Echelon Committee tabled its final report. The work was also widely praised. Even when we were still drafting the report, however, it was already clear that the Commission was treating the matter like the famous three monkeys who, in the Buddhist tradition, are supposed to report on mankind at the Koshin festival in accordance with the dictum, ‘Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil’. One year on we might almost add, 'and do not do very much either', because so far the Commission has not acted to remedy very many of the shortcomings or implement many of the tasks described in the report. Commissioner, you will be aware of what we call on the Commission to do in items 27 to 44 of the report. The question that is still outstanding is: what have you done about informing the public and companies of the dangers posed by Echelon? What have you done to ensure that e-mails within the Commission are systematically encrypted? And what has been done about training Commission staff in new technologies and encryption? It is not enough to introduce new technologies; you have to provide further training for staff as well. Your data protection directives, which are very important and very far-reaching, are actually only of limited interest here. There too the question is: what has happened within the Commission? You said that you had adopted a decision. Nevertheless, I see no evidence that the Commission has in the meantime carried out the security analysis that we requested, which actually also requires the development of a comprehensive system for classifying people and documents so as to protect secrets. That was clear from what you said. My question, then, is: who is responsible for this in the Commission? I remember very well the time that you sent Mr Perkins to see us. He was the head of the Commission's encryption service. He could certainly tell us how advanced the cryptographic hardware was, but could not tell us anything about general security standards in the Commission. Clearly there was nobody who was really responsible for this, and – at least this is my feeling – there is still nobody today either. Or, Commissioner, are you or one of the Directorates-General responsible for ensuring that documents are continuously classified? Do you intervene in personnel issues and classify people so as to guarantee security in the Commission? Nowadays, every national institution has someone who is in charge of protecting secret information and does precisely these tasks. Do you now have such a person in your Commission, someone who is also responsible for raising awareness of possible attacks by the Echelon system? Or are you actually still working with a British fax encryption system, Commissioner? I almost fear that the answer is yes, because you did not say anything about this. That is why we are going to give you a helping hand by adopting a new resolution and, Commissioner, should progress on this continue to be as disappointing as it has been so far, and should our points continue to be almost ignored, then we would also have to reach an understanding on the basis of the forthcoming Commission discharge. Our instructions to you will be on the table very shortly. I urge you to act on them! (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission draft and the accompanying Parliamentary report, which we are debating today, can be described, without qualms, as the European institutions' admission of bankruptcy as regards asylum policy. Mr Vitorino, it is you who bear primary responsibility for the fact that, in the course of three years, your House has failed to produce even one single proposal on the right of asylum on which we might come to a compromise. What is even worse is that your House does not yet, for any practical purposes, separate the three pillars of economic migration, asylum rights and subsidiary protection. That is why your proposals regularly end up in the Council's waste paper basket. The left-wingers in this House, though, also bear their due share of responsibility for the failures to date. Even the Commission is going beyond the harmonisation of minimum standards, yet, as a matter of principle, the left-wingers keep on making the proposals broader. There is nothing, though, to equal the mendacity involved in you delivering great speeches in this House on asylum policy and allowing yourself to be lauded as the defender of refugees' rights, while your own left-wing governments, in Great Britain and Germany for example, boast about their strict policies on asylum. Even Mr Cohn-Bendit argued on French television last week in favour of tighter regulation. Why? Because, at home, you are subject to quite another kind of public scrutiny, and there you have a responsibility to our citizens, whose capacity for assimilating refugees has limits – limits that you consistently disregard here. Tomorrow, then, we will be putting our amendments to a vote by roll call in order to expose your hypocrisy to the public gaze. Let me turn now to the report. There is nothing new about your proposal to expand the definition of ‘refugee’ far beyond what is contained in the Geneva Convention. Hitherto, this has always been rejected by us, by the Council, and even by the minister in Germany's red/green government. If you have your way, people receiving subsidiary protection will be treated in almost the same way as recognised asylum seekers. That, though, is quite nonsensical. In Germany, we have known refugees from civil wars not to apply for asylum, because, as a rule, they want to return to their country once the civil war there has ended. Integration in the host country is not for them, nor do they want it in the least. Anyone who demands compulsory schooling for the children of these refugees must need his state of mind examined. Most of these children speak not a word of the host country's language, and you want to have their status reviewed only after five years instead of after one! I can imagine no situation in which the conditions giving entitlement to subsidiary protection are present five years running. No, different groups need different arrangements, and so the Council is right to call for two different approaches. Why does this directive again concern itself with the reunification of families? After the first flop that you and the Commission produced here, I wonder if you, Commissioner, are working on a new holistic approach? So what is it to be – an integrated approach or rules in every single proposal? I do not doubt that the Council will chuck this proposal in the dustbin as well. You, though, will in future prefer to talk about open coordination, and will thereby conceal the fact that a European asylum system has been a failure, a failure you yourself provoked. Your proposals have a damaging effect on European integration. We reject them and support the amendments tabled by our – and your – chairman, Mr Hernández Mollar. (Applause)
von Boetticher (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Vitorino, it is cause for amazement that an institution such as the Commission should commit itself to the open coordination method. It is something of a Metternich method rather than a Monnet method, and the use of it by you – the European Commission – is an indication that your own approach to asylum policy has failed. That Mr Evans, the rapporteur, being British, should speak up for open coordination is not that surprising, but it is quite remarkable that you should adduce the Community employment policy as an example of how this method has been successfully used, as you have obviously not been following the current employment situation and the state of the labour market in the EU, otherwise you would be well aware of how open coordination has failed in this area. Let me make some comments on specific points. In the report, it is envisaged that asylum-seekers' biometric data will not be used in the investigation of crime until there is a separate system of European data protection in place for it. Vote for that, and you leave yourself open to the question as to why the general standard of data protection in the European Union and in its Member States is apparently not sufficient to offer asylum seekers adequate protection against the misuse of data. When it comes to data protection, we in Europe have the highest standards in the world. Why you should want to use such an absurd requirement to prevent the effective implementation of Eurodac and hence the protection of our citizens, remains a mystery. That this report should call for the procedure for acquiring refugee status to be speeded up is indeed a good thing. What we are dealing with here is indeed, in principle, just the checking of an application. That, too, is something the PPE-DE Group has been advocating for some time, yet it was your group, Mr Evans, that in various reports advocated one new appeals board after another, guarantees of legal redress that became ever more comprehensive and bureaucratic, the constant reduction of the State's right to submit evidence and hence, of course, more lengthy procedures. It would be nice if you were to back up the words in this report with actions in others. With my third observation, I come to what is our main problem. In this report, you have not a word to say about our society's real problems. You have not one word to say about how we should deal with those who support the committing of terrorist acts. What do we do when someone, with the provocation of our public in mind, wants to call his child Osama Bin Laden? What do we do with people who publicly rejoice in the images of 11 September? What do we do with Islamic preachers who preach hatred and violence? How do we respond to people who by their words trample our free and democratic system of government underfoot? Do we have to wait until these people commit a terrorist act before we are permitted to deport them, or before they cease to enjoy the rights of visitors? It is that question that is currently being asked over and over again in our societies in view of the situation in which we find ourselves. It is to these questions that we must give answers. There is in fact nothing whatever about that in your report, but these are questions we will have to resolve in many future debates. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteurs, but also to the Commission. You see, Commissioner Vitorino, that I am being very even-handed with praise and blame today. Let me start with victim support. Past decades saw well-known worldwide NGOs concerning themselves time and again with offenders in every corner of the globe, with the conditions under which they were detained and with their rehabilitation into society. Often, unfortunately, their victims were forgotten and left alone. Even today, far from all our Member States guarantee comprehensive victim support, particularly not to nationals of third States. In many States, as little account is taken of victims of offences of negligence as of victims who are unable to prove lasting or grave detriment. To date, only the victim compensation rules in the Scandinavian States – Denmark, Sweden and Finland – can be described as exemplary. Time and again, in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I come up against cases in which compensation was either not paid out to victims, or it was at any rate unreasonably delayed, where even EU citizens in other EU States had applied for it. In the past year alone, a dozen petitions from victims of violent crime within the EU have been passed on to us. Admittedly, there has hitherto been no legal basis on which we would have been entitled to intervene. It is to be hoped that this will now change, particularly if the Commission allows its Green Paper to be followed up by definite legal acts. There is one thing we should not do at this juncture. We should not set up another EU fund, as it is intolerable that the Member States should evade their own financial responsibility in this matter. If the USA can manage to lift the financial burden from dependents of the victims of 11 September, wherever in the world and irrespective of their nationality, then it can also be expected of the Member States of the EU within their own territory. Mr Santini's proposal on legal aid is also a significant step towards the creation of this legal area. The regulation on cooperation and enforcement in civil and commercial cases is already in place, as is judicial assistance between the Member States of the European Union in criminal cases. This has enabled us to get quicker and simple cross-border justice for Europe's citizens, which means that time is pressing upon us when it comes to creating a European form of access to legal aid, by which means alone we will contribute to the fair application of existing European regulations to those who would otherwise be unable to take a case to trial. And, Mr Cashman, you are quite deluded if you believe that this can only apply to cross-border trials, for if you were to establish a higher standard for the whole of Europe, your own people would blow up a storm, and if you were to create a lower standard across Europe, you would have to answer the question as to why you were treating the EU's citizens worse than your own. That makes the approximation of laws absolutely necessary, and I do not know any reason why we should not go ahead with it on a Europe-wide basis. (Applause)
von Boetticher (PPE-DE

 Mr President, since the vote in committee we have attempted to reach a compromise with the Council on the contentious points. We all wanted to avoid a conciliation procedure, but not – let me make this quite clear now – at any price! Mrs Paciotti made things very simple from the outset and specifically stated that she would support all the points that the Council accepted. That really is a strange position for a Member of Parliament to adopt! Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi then tabled certain proposals for compromise with the Council on behalf of our group, and we have negotiated on that package in countless meetings and discussions also involving the Presidency. The Council has of course, as always, now very cleverly unpicked our package for tactical reasons and negotiated all the proposals for compromise individually with the various interested parties. That means that for the time being we have accepted a compromise on data retention under which there can be standard legal deviations from the general European legislation at national level, rather than having decisions made on a case-by-case basis. We have also abandoned the idea of a time limit and have therefore almost totally accepted the Council's position. In the case of e
-mail advertising, despite having major reservations we have agreed to the general opt-in. However, I regarded it as being a condition that the area of application should be broad if there is already contact between interested parties and companies. But instead we now have a very limited wording: companies can only advertise similar products and products already inquired about by customers. The area of application we suggested has also had the word 'cooperations' taken out. I could have accepted all these restrictions as a compromise, and could also accept this if the Council had made some concessions to us on the final issue and had really accepted the opt-out position for directories of subscribers. However, in this case the Council was only willing to agree on a variant in which the decision is left to the Member States. However, that means that the Council would not even have remotely accepted any of Parliament's key points. I scarcely regard that as acceptable, and that is why I repeat that I wish to avoid the reconciliation procedure, but not at any cost! If the Council wants to play poker on this, we can play that game too, and for us that means remaining resolute and supporting Mr Cappato's Amendment No 14. Otherwise we will essentially only have lost ground during the unofficial negotiations, and not gained anything at all.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are the proposals now put before us so important? Some Member States have indeed so far neglected to adequately back up Community regulations on environmental protection with the threat of sanctions. It was thus that the number of violations in the environmental field identified by the Commission rose from 612 in 1999 to 755 in 2000. As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to add that such cases are increasingly brought to light as a result of petitions being submitted. It is our EU's citizens themselves who have developed a feel for environmental concerns and who increasingly report such offences 
or who turn to us in search of help for frequent lack of protection on the part of their Member State. It would, then, be great if governments could demonstrate something like the same degree of environmental awareness as do their citizens. In 2000, the Commission took Member States to the European Court of Justice in connection with 39 cases, and so it is time for us to respond on an EU-wide basis. In doing so, it is not our intention to annul national criminal law – the directive applies only to activities in defence of Community environment law and the regulations by means of which the Member States have hitherto transposed it. We are laying down only minimum requirements for the protection of the environment through criminal law, so that the retention or creation of stricter safeguards is left to the Member States. What this directive combats above all is environmental pollution that is attributable to private individuals or corporate bodies, in which respect inducement must incur a penalty in the same way as active behaviour and failure to act where there is a legal duty to do so. Environmental offences still appear to be regarded as excusable peccadilloes in some Member States. That must come to an end. The directive, like the framework decision, is necessary, appropriate, and proportionate to that purpose.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dismantling of our internal borders and the police cooperation associated with it, as well as the securing of our external border, will be among the greatest challenges to face the European Union in the new century. Mr Oostlander, in his report, has earned our gratitude by referring in his report to the need for a common immigration policy on the external borders. My report, though, covers the future development of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement in the area of cross-border surveillance. Where the internal borders have already been dismantled, the national police are able, after consultation with the police of a neighbouring state, to observe suspects who are active on both sides of the border. Together with hot pursuit, the instrument of cross-border surveillance has thus to date, offered the most effective option in enforcing the law across borders. It was only last week that it became clear in Germany just how necessary such an arrangement is, when hostages were taken following a bank robbery and the culprits fled over the border into Poland and then into the Ukraine. Although there was good cooperation in this instance, an arrangement such as the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement would certainly have made enforcement even easier. The Council proposal is intended to extend the range of offences liable to cross-border surveillance by adding to them organised fraud, offences in connection with the trafficking in human beings, the laundering of proceeds from organised crime and dealing in radioactive materials. The question remains in my mind as to why we do not also fall back on the catalogue of terrorist offences that we adopted only a few months ago, which I see as having been a very important decision, and one that we should incorporate into this proposal. I therefore felt that Mr Buijtenweg's proposal, and the proposals made by other Members, had something positive to add. We otherwise find ourselves increasingly lost in a thicket of innumerable and different regulations on judicial cooperation in criminal matters. We will in the future have to work at standard penal frameworks significantly more than we have done in the past. At the same time, the fact is overlooked that the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement has to date suffered not only from a narrow scope of application, but also from bureaucratic obstacles. I have therefore proposed a number of systematic clarifications, which met with wide-ranging support in the committee. We should, then, have the courage to achieve real new developments and move forward with the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement. The number of times that cross-border surveillance has been used has tripled in the time since it was introduced. The most frequent obstacle, according to the officers engaged in its implementation, is often the lack of a right of arrest. Officers carrying out surveillance duties on foreign territory have hitherto had to watch impotently as crimes were committed. They are not permitted to intervene, but can only inform their colleagues with jurisdiction in that state, who tend themselves to be stretched to their full capacity already. By the time they, in their turn, intervene, the culprits are, as a rule, over the hills and far away. I therefore propose that it should also be possible for foreign police officers engaged in cross-border surveillance work to detain culprits until police officers of that state arrive, if, firstly, an extraditable offence has been committed and, secondly, if that State's own police are no longer in a position to prevent the offence being committed. It is no doubt impossible to get our European citizens to understand why foreign police officers may observe, but are unable to intervene when the situation becomes critical and a crime is being committed. In this respect, we should be significantly better at adapting our laws to the realities of this Europe of ours, which is growing together. The Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, however, continues to develop, it is my firm conviction that there is a need in a Europe that is growing together, for the European Union to have real police competences. Within the framework of the Convention, which, as is well known, is looking to reshape the Treaties, we will not only be able to discuss what competences we might have to relocate in the Member States, but we must also specify the areas in which we additionally need primary competences at a European level. The combating of organised crime, and across borders at that, is one such area, one where we as a Parliament must emphatically make the point that, in order to facilitate control by Parliament and by the public prosecutors, we need a primary police executive for a limited sphere of activity.

Mr President, let me say one thing at the outset, namely that I am no great friend of ombudsmen. I still feel that we, as elected members of Parliament, should be the primary ombudsmen of the people of Europe. Why do we need a Data Protection Supervisor? My esteemed fellow MEP, Timothy Kirkhope, justified it on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and by reference to data protection's significance. I do not believe that one can argue in this way, as we would next need a family ombudsman, a women's ombudsman and a children's ombudsman as well. All these groups have an important place in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In Schleswig-Holstein, the province of the Federal Republic of Germany from which I come, we have developed a veritable abomination; we even have a bicycle ombudsman. Anyone, though, who believes that cyclists come off better out of this, even in the planning of the budget, is, as we say, barking up the wrong tree. No, data protection really is important, and the reason why it is so to us is that we parliamentarians find monitoring difficult – even the monitoring of the Commission, and especially of what goes on within it – and so, of course, we need an auxiliary person in this field. He or she, as Mr Ceyhun rightly said, must be based in Brussels, where he or she is to carry on the work of monitoring. Let us move on to remuneration. No matter how important the position may be, I really cannot see that an ombudsman, who is to monitor this data, should, in salary terms, be on the same footing as a judge at the European Court of Justice. Why that should be the case completely eludes me. A judge at the Court of Justice occupies a significantly superior and more important position. The judges are, in any case, the guardians of our treaties. Why, then, should we pay a data protection supervisor as much as a judge at the ECJ? I think that in this respect our yardsticks of value have shifted a bit over the years, and they need to be put back in order. We should rather think about bringing the Ombudsman back to the right pay level instead of going straight ahead with allocating too much to the next position. On this point, I appeal for a bit more of a sense of reality.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will first thank the rapporteur, who has analysed this very technical report with great expertise and proposed a range of editorial amendments that we can all support. We, likewise, welcome and support the Swedish initiative, which is before us now, to further develop the Schengen acquis. Some parts of it have, however, already been overtaken by reality, as the breakneck speed of developments in European internal affairs and justice policy since the terrorist attacks on 11 September might well have made this report and this submission largely obsolete, at least as regards extradition policy. Thus, the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs and of Justice, on 20 September, had already set in motion a simpler procedure for handing over criminals and for the mutual recognition of court judgments. We welcome the fact that there is broad European agreement on criminal law and criminal procedure as well. This will lead to better combating of crime on our continent and promote the Community legal area. This being so, I could save myself further great speeches on the Swedish initiative, as Mr Marinho has already made the main points. I would, though, like to enlarge on one point, namely that the provisions of the 1995 EU Agreement on simplified extradition procedures and the 1996 EU Agreement on extradition between Member States are, according to this proposal, to be extended to Iceland and Norway as a further development of the Schengen acquis. So far, so good. Yet, out of Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and England, none have, to date, ratified one of these agreements. This is especially scandalous in view of the candidate states having undertaken to accept the Schengen acquis. The Member States must at last become aware of their need to set an example, specifically as regards the transposition and ratification of EU acts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting on the Cappato report for the second time. Our positions have moved closer, without, however, becoming identical. So the rapporteur has taken misgivings on the left of this House into account, in that the consumer's consent will in future be required for the sending of SMS advertising. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has accepted by a substantial majority the so-called soft opt-out compromise supported by the rapporteur. This proposal alone defends the interests of consumers without doing away with European jobs on a massive scale. Why? If Parliament were to generally prohibit business-to-customer advertising from the outset, as Mrs Paciotti's proposal would have it, businesses would simply send their advertising material into the European Union from the USA or other third States. The European consumer would have gained nothing, absolutely nothing, and the only effect would be to weaken the European e-business market. We therefore want to let those states that at present have an opt-out system retain it, keep an eye on developments and come to a new decision after two years. At the same time, the Cappato proposal takes three steps to protect the consumer. First, the consumer can put his name on what is termed a ‘Robinson list’, so that advertising material may not generally be sent to him. Secondly, the consumer can, simply and without charge, indicate his wish not to receive e-mail advertising from specific companies. Thirdly, e-mail advertising will be easily recognisable as such in the inbox and will be able to be deleted simply and without cost. This last option is already available from providers such as AOL – I am sure Mr van Velzen is about to point that out – but this does not put AOL in a monopolistic position. Such an assertion is complete nonsense, as anyone can already download from the Internet a spam recognition program of this sort, no matter what Internet Service Provider he has a contract with for everything else. By the way, AOL was itself opposed to such a regulation. So I would ask you to support Mr Cappato's proposed compromise by a significant majority.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today sees the fulfilment of a small dream. I have ten minutes' speaking time, as much as only a Group chairman can normally expect. This, however, comes about through the grouping together of two reports, which do not actually belong together. So I would prefer to speak on them separately. Let me begin with the area of civil law. When the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, judicial cooperation in civil matters became a matter of common concern for the Member States. Then the Treaty of Amsterdam, by means of Article 65 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, transferred this cooperation from the third pillar to the first. Its entry into force brought about active European lawmaking. Regulations on conflicts of law or of jurisdiction were adjusted, the Council directive on insolvency procedures and on the service of legal documents in civil and commercial cases was adopted, and draft directives on the gathering of evidence and on rights of access in matrimonial cases were submitted to the Council. The entry into force of the present Treaty of Nice means that future decisions on judicial cooperation in civil matters will finally be reached by codecision procedure with qualified majority in the Council. You can see that things in this field are developing at breakneck speed. Member States will continue to have sole responsibility for the framework and content of professional training in civil law, but it will be the Community's responsibility to support them whether in the removal of obstacles to the application of Community law or in the cooperation of the judicial authorities. In no area of European law is continuing professional education so imperative as in civil law, in which harmonisation has already made progress. Criminal and administrative law, on the other hand, are still only at the beginning of their European development. This continuing education was formerly supported by two EU programmes. GROTIUS, the joint incentive and exchange programme for the legal profession, came to an end in 2000. This promotion was maintained only by a successor programme, GROTIUS Programme Civil, which was limited to one year. The same year saw the expiry of the Robert Schuman Project, which had been limited to three years and served to make lawyers more aware of Community law. The Commission proposal before us today now represents the legal basis for further financial support for activities in the field of legal cooperation in civil matters. It promotes judicial cooperation and improved mutual understanding of legal systems, as well as measures to transpose and implement Community legislation in this area and better information for the public. For the first time, alongside finance for specific projects, there is the prospect of financial help with the running costs of European NGOs. I can only emphatically support that. The facilitation of involvement by the acceding countries is also especially to be welcomed. Apart from the essential rejoicing at the direction of this draft, which is made all the greater by the generous financial framework amounting to EUR 14.5 million up to 2006, there remain a few critical points. The stipulation that NGOs can only apply for support if two-thirds of the Member States participate in them can hardly be complied with even today. The prospect of enlargement therefore makes it a matter of urgency to reduce this hurdle to one-third, or else this directive's good beginnings will be nipped in the bud. I also wonder why the Commission, contrary to its former practice – for example in the context of the GROTIUS programmes – has omitted to define precisely who is entitled to apply, members of the legal profession in this case. The debate on the money-laundering directive showed us how vital it is in this area to define terms. Member States must not have discretion to define terms when support with European funds is at issue. I have therefore proposed the adoption of the old definition from the GROTIUS civil law programme. I would also like to say, on this point, that I would have been glad if the EU had continued to bear up to 80% of project costs, rather than reducing this share to 50%. This was, however, not what the relevant committee wanted. I think, though, that the EU continues to bear a great responsibility for the further development of judicial cooperation. This responsibility is likely to increase rather than decrease in the future. Here, too, we must continue to be a motive force. So much for the first part concerning the area of civil law; I now come to the debate on the Schengen Information System. The Schengen Information System was established in 1995 on the basis of the Convention of 1990 which implemented the Schengen Agreement. Today, as a police investigation system overlapping states and supported by computers, it facilitates online access to over 8 million items of data produced by investigations and is thus the most comprehensive database in Europe. It is used by Iceland and Norway as well as thirteen EU Member States. All this makes SIS a successful component of a new European internal security policy, made necessary by the dismantling of internal borders and the resulting loss of surveillance. Two problems concern us today, the first being advances in technology. The Schengen Information System as we know it today was originally conceived for eighteen Member States. The fact that all the present acceding countries will join in SIS on their accession makes it urgently necessary to give thought today to what will be its successor. Technology has moved on in the meantime as well. The initiative taken by the kingdoms of Sweden and Belgium to develop SIS II are therefore much to be welcomed. As the development of SIS II will require over three years' preparatory work, these initiatives lay the necessary legal foundations for its budget. The originators have, however, overshot their mark a bit. In order to ensure the maximum influence on technical development, the Member States are to take part in the comitological process through a combination of administrative and regulatory committees. This will therefore involve a maximum of additional bureaucratic effort. It is not clear to me why, at a development stage where only technical aspects are to be discussed, the Member States are to join in discussing and deciding on every detail. The suggestion that a regulatory committee should be in place to deal with all matters concerning the system's architecture and with data protection issues, also goes against Council decision 468/99. This stated that recourse should be had to the regulatory procedure only for measures of general scope intended to apply essential provisions of basic legal instruments. Such is quite evidently not the case here. At this stage, I would like to point out to the representatives of the Council that, for example, when Eurodac was set up, there was deliberately no official participatory procedure, and the Member States exerted their influence only through an informal network of technical experts. This saved us all a great deal of time and money and still produced an effective result. At the same time, I have confidence in the technical know-how in this field possessed by the Commission, which is entrusted with guiding this development. I therefore suggest to Member States that they replace the superfluous bureaucratic combination of administrative and regulatory procedure by a combination of administrative and consultative procedure. Less is sometimes more. The second problem is the development of law. The Member States did admittedly decide as early as the Amsterdam Inter-Governmental Conference to integrate the Schengen Agreement into the European legal area, but lack of agreement meant that the Schengen Information System was assigned to the third pillar. There is no doubt, however, that collection of data on persons who have been barred from entering a Member State is within the scope of the first pillar. This is another reason why we have two initiatives today, one by the Belgian Presidency and another by Sweden. As Europe's Parliament, we strive to integrate Schengen and the Schengen Information System into the first pillar, and as a whole if at all possible. It is only in that way that appropriate parliamentary control can be guaranteed. So I will go on the record as welcoming, as a step in this direction, the financing of Schengen II out of Community funds with effect from 2002. The initiative unfortunately forgets to submit to Parliament the Commission's half-yearly interim reports on the stage the development has reached. It is scarcely comprehensible that the budget procedure of the European Community should be applied to finance Schengen II without the body legislating for that budget – namely Parliament – being informed about these developments at the time. However much the direction taken by the report's contents may be worthy of approval, in this respect there must be clear improvement. Apart from that, I can only give my full and wholehearted support to the proposals as a whole. I crave your indulgence for having to leave in about a quarter of an hour – as indeed must other ladies and gentlemen – but we have a meeting of the Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. We have some votes to take part in there as well. So there is no disrespect for this House. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication on a Community immigration policy with common standards and a common status for recognised asylum-seekers has provoked a much-needed debate and you deliberately arranged for an open debate at the outset, Commissioner Vitorino. Various possible scenarios have been presented and the possibilities for a common procedure and common principles have been investigated. I deeply regret that in contrast to the Pirker report it was not possible to achieve a broad compromise in committee. Unfortunately, in the case of the Evans report, instead of a reasonable consensus emerging, it was ideology that won the day. It is intended that both the grounds on which asylum is granted and the procedures involved should be extended across Europe. This is despite the fact, as you mentioned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that at present some 90% of asylum-seekers apply for asylum on purely economic grounds and are therefore rejected, and despite the fact that the present checking procedures can take up to eight years. I am sure that it is only possible to agree to extensions of this kind if you have totally lost sight of the position in your own country. What will the impact on us be if arrangements of the kind Mr Evans is presenting to us today become a reality, and if in future persecution by non-State agents and gender-related persecution are recognised? In practice this would amount to granting an unlimited right of residence in the EU to most families in the Islamic world. Why is that? Let me explain. No one would deny that in every Islamic country there are fundamentalist groups that use Islam to discriminate against women's rights, from the perspective of our system of values. Which means that any woman in an Islamic State can make a valid claim of persecution by non-State groups. If this were to be recognised in the EU, she would then be able to bring her entire family to join her. So the question we need to ask here is this: do we want to and are we able here in Europe to solve the problems of the Islamic world and the problems of the Islamic view of women? I have a clear answer to that: no! And the picture is even clearer now that we are all aware of the problems and risks that have arisen over the last few weeks. At the same time, Mr Evans, contrary to his original statement, wishes to abolish the concept of a safe third country and thus burden the in any case protracted procedures with additional checks. My own conclusion is therefore that in its present form the Evans report is irresponsible. It gives the Member States sufficient arguments for refusing to give us the right of codecision when further EU reforms in this area are being considered. It is evident that there is a majority in this House that is not yet mature enough to be given such responsibility. Mr Evans, if you are advocating an extension of the right of asylum here, then I would ask you what steps your own party, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, has taken in this direction in recent years? I can tell you that it has certainly not dealt with things in this way. That is because it does not have the support of a majority of the population for such steps and Labour could otherwise expect to be voted out. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to be quite explicit about this, and it is obvious in any case: if we try to standardise every detail of the right of asylum across Europe in future, we will be unable to achieve agreement on this in the Council of Ministers. That is why I am specifically asking you and advising you to limit harmonisation to the necessary minimum standards. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recently, when I had to explain the function of our Echelon
 Committee, I used the following example: I said, ‘Imagine you are a detective sergeant. Various people come to you and report a bombing, carried out by five terrorists. At the scene of the crime indicated there are two possible victims, but they say nothing. The five suspects are also silent. The explosive device is not immediately apparent and no details of the incident are known. In short, it is a rather difficult case. This is tantamount to what happened when journalists began to tell us that there was a global interception system called Echelon 
which was operated by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and which could intercept and analyse phone, fax and e-mail communications worldwide. Individuals, businesses and institutions, they said, were subjected to systematic surveillance. So what facts have we established after a year of investigation? As the detective sergeant, I would say that the five suspects were indeed at the scene of the crime, but the weapon was a precision rifle rather than a bomb. Each of the suspects was capable of firing the weapon, but all the evidence suggests that only one of them actually acted in a criminal manner. The victims have given us clues to help us in our investigations but are not prepared to testify in court, and so we unfortunately have insufficient evidence to secure a conviction. It will be essential, however, to keep the suspects under observation and to take further precautions.’ What this means is that the five aforementioned states do indeed cooperate within this espionage system. Its name is irrelevant, but let us call it Echelon
 for the sake of convenience. The system, however, can only intercept civilian communications that are routed via Intelsat satellites. And these satellites only carry a small percentage of global telecommunications traffic and an even smaller percentage of private telephone calls. Moreover, these activities by intelligence services were tolerated by the international community on condition that they were essential to the protection of national security interests. There are now indications, however, that the United States is using some of these intercepted data for purposes other than the preservation of national security. The US agencies have admitted, for example, that they eavesdrop on European companies bidding for major foreign contracts, allegedly because these companies engage in bribery. The agencies’ intelligence reports are then forwarded to US embassies so that the ambassador to the awarding country can influence the host government by making it aware of the bribery allegations. The US Department of Commerce also has an Advocacy Center, which maintains, through the US embassies, a worldwide network devoted solely to helping US corporations land major contracts. There are clear grounds for suspecting the United States of illegal industrial espionage. Regrettably, the companies that have been victims of these activities remain silent for fear of tarnishing their image. At this point I should like to thank the rapporteur and his team for resisting the attempts of the Greens, as well as those from the Left of this chamber, to have him write a cloak-and-dagger thriller. His report is responsible and objective, presents the conclusive and presumptive evidence, distinguishing clearly between the two, and does not prejudge the issue. Some may feel that his conclusions do not go far enough, but they do exhaust the available legal options. Protection against illegal acts committed by non-European intelligence services can only be achieved through global instruments. As far as our own area of responsibility is concerned, the main priority for us is to close the confidentiality gaps in the Commission. Unlike the Council or the Central Bank, the Commission persists with data protection and confidentiality mechanisms that belong to the Middle Ages. The dangers posed by non-European countries in this domain have obviously been entirely underestimated. We therefore call on the competent committee to initiate its own report on this issue. We also call on our British friends, since they are fellow members of the European Union, to establish effective and legitimate control of American espionage conducted against European targets from British territory; otherwise they are in breach of European data protection law. Let me thank the rapporteur once again for his cooperation with us. I am sure that this report will carry the support of an overwhelming majority of the Members of this House. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to address all the issues raised in the Commission’s proposal for a directive on data protection in electronic communications. Most of the proposals are well-founded and necessary, and have our support. This also applies to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, whom I would like to congratulate on his work. There is one highly controversial issue, however. What is our position on direct advertising by e-mail? At present, there are four Member States in Europe which have opt-in systems, which means that commercial e-mails are banned if they are unsolicited, and are permitted only with the prior consent of the recipient. Most other Member States have an opt-out solution, with individuals having to register on Robinson lists if they do not wish to receive commercial e-mails. We therefore have two options: Amendments Nos 42, 43 and 44 proposed by the Committee and the rapporteur call for an opt-out solution as a minimum standard, supplemented by Amendment No 61, which provides for review after three years. Countries which have an existing opt-in system can continue with this as an “add-on” to the minimum standard. Amendments Nos 53, 60 and 62 call for an immediate introduction of the opt-in system which would then be compulsory for all Member States. There are good arguments for both opt-in and opt-out and we will hear many more of them in this debate, undoubtedly presented with passion. I confess that I tend to favour an opt-in solution. Nonetheless, there is a serious decision before us today, and that is whether to adopt option 1, i.e. opt-out as the minimum standard, thus maintaining the status quo in the Member States. Why do we have this situation? Firstly, we chose the opt-out solution as a minimum standard in the e
-Commerce Directive a year ago, although this will also be reviewed in three years. It would be absurd, incoherent and contradictory to adopt a conclusive solution in this directive, whether it be opt-in or opt-out, just a year later. Secondly, no one can predict the precise course of events. No one can say with certainty what the advantages and disadvantages of the two options will be in the next two years. Trade practices, citizens’ information requirements, but also their security needs are undergoing rapid change. It is quite impossible to predict how the commercial sector will respond to the new opportunities afforded by direct advertising by e-mail. It may be tempting to make comparisons with conventional mailshots, but this is inappropriate. Let us remain faithful to our original approach, without drawing any hasty conclusions, and wait for the outcomes of this House’s wise decision – which was adopted with an overwhelming majority – on the e
-Commerce Directive: opt-out as a minimum standard, and the option of opt-in for Member States, with monitoring of the two approaches. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half years have passed since the Tampere Council decided to set up Eurojust as a European coordination unit for criminal prosecution authorities and public prosecutors. This is a relatively short period of time if you compare progress in other areas of European policy. In Parliament we have been very positive towards this rapid progress and have taken an active interest in it. After Europol, the creation of Eurojust is a further important step towards combating organised cross-border crime in Europe more effectively. The first step in the judicial area, namely setting up the European Judicial Network, has already been a success. With the help of this network, for example, the public prosecutor in the German town of Celle was, within the space of a few hours, able to deploy an undercover detective from Belgian customs and, together with public prosecutors from another country, carry out an observation operation in a third country, again within the space of a few hours. Thus many an opportunity to give mutual assistance – which was supposed forgotten – has been made to bear fruit. Problems remained, however, for example with interpreting conventions on mutual assistance, criminal law and criminal proceedings and with the division of responsibilities. To compound matters there were communication problems because of the natural language barriers. With Eurojust these obstacles should now be surmounted. Eurojust has, first and foremost, a clearing function. The officials are to draft comparisons of laws, resolve bilateral disputes over the application and interpretation of conventions on mutual assistance, set priorities for fighting crime in Europe and monitor current transnational criminal prosecution measures. In the future, Eurojust will also have to keep lists of transnational investigations and be in a position to pass on this information; it will have to act as a registration point for information on serious offences and plan, coordinate and run training and development programmes. Through Eurojust, the national prosecution authorities will have access to reliable legal advice – without encountering language difficulties – and will be able to resolve transnational disputes. I should like to express my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Gebhardt, for drafting Parliament's opinion, which is now to be put to the vote, and for the good level of cooperation. Alongside her amendments, there is one further amendment in particular to which I attach great importance. Until now, the judicial network has been a body without a head. If we are now setting up Eurojust to be the missing head then we are also obliged to provide shared nerve fibres, without which body and head will not function together. Eurojust and the European Judicial Network should not stand alongside each other or only enter loosely into contact with each other; they need to be bound together in one unit. This can be achieved by using the already existing contact points of the European Judicial Network instead of the proposed national correspondents for Eurojust. Only in this way can a superfluous juxtaposition of two systems with the same area of responsibility be avoided in the long term. This is one of the ideas which our proposals contain. I should like to ask the Council to take account of these in its considerations. Then Eurojust really will be a success and make a contribution to the people of Europe living in greater security. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this point I would like to return to the two points on which we are critical of the Commission proposal. The first is the issue of dual optionality in the allocation of refugees from civil wars, that is to say the possibility that a refugee has to select a country, and a country's right to reject any refugee. The founding fathers created the ‘European home’ as a place for solidarity, above all. This solidarity can still be seen today, for example when European funding is used to support structurally weak regions. So not only is the call for more equitable burden sharing as regards receiving refugees justified, but also burden sharing itself is an expression of solidarity between the peoples of Europe. As various Members have already pointed out, only a few Member States bore a share of the burdens resulting from the civil wars in former Yugoslavia. It is all very easy for Mrs Frahm to talk big, because she comes from a country which has not, so far, exactly distinguished itself when it comes to such acts of solidarity. Unlike the governments at the Nice Summit, we, as directly elected Members of the European Parliament, are obliged here to overcome national differences and to opt for a European solution founded upon a quota-based allocation of refugees in accordance with Member States' absorptive capacity. Otherwise, dual optionality will render the positive approach adopted in the Commission's proposal superfluous. The second important point is family reunification. Here, too, a fundamental principle of our Community is at stake – subsidiarity. Today it will be decided whether the EU should reserve for itself, in a centralist way, the process of defining and regulating what constitutes a family, or whether in the first place the concept of a nuclear family, which is common to all Member States, should be taken as a basis, with regulations going any further than that being at Member States' discretion. The compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Wiebenga, provides for the latter. This follows this House's tradition of fighting the attempts of the Brussels bureaucracy to arrogate to itself the powers of the Member States. Today, you have a chance to demonstrate what this concept of subsidiarity means to you. I urge you to vote for the fair traditions of this House and for the fundamental principles of our Community of values, and not to be swayed by purely national interests and party political calculations. I urge you, when it comes to these important issues, to vote for Mr Wiebenga's compromise amendments. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in my career as a Member of the European Parliament, I am happy in the certain knowledge that the Council will give Parliament‘s misguided and dangerous opinion the consideration it deserves, i.e. none at all! Commissioner Vitorino, although I hold you in high regard – and have said as much on many occasions in this House – the Commission document itself is shot through with negligent ignorance as to the situation in the very Member States that have been generous enough to accord large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers the right to protection and hospitality over the past few years. You ask too much of our society, and in so doing, run the risk of creating a breeding ground for something that we have always fought against in this House. The liberal and social democrat delegates from the large Member States – because so far today, I have only heard speakers of this political persuasion from the small Member States – must ask themselves whether they are remotely in touch with the electorate, whether they are aware of the consequences, and whether they have grasped that more authority for Parliament in these matters would also bring increased responsibility. The age is past when we could hold forth here on our dreams for making the world a better place, without repercussions. I would be very interested to see how you intend to justify today’s decision to your electorate. Many of you will only vote in favour of this proposal today because you know full well that the Council will never endorse it as it stands. I feel this is unworthy of you. It is contrary to our task and to the mandate we have been given by the electorate. I would just like to briefly pick up on the comments you made about polygamous marriages, which caused you to shake your head. For goodness sake, go and read Article 3, paragraph 2, which says: therefore, whilst it is not permissible to bring in several wives and their children, it is, on the other hand, permissible to bring in one wife and her children. This means I could have married someone here in the Member States, and would be at liberty, under certain circumstances, to have at least one more wife join me. In other words, there is admissibility. That is the fact of the matter. In this way, it would be possible…. (Heckling)
 ... no, that is precisely how it can be interpreted in legal terms! It gives free rein to all kinds of interpretations. There is only one thing we can do here, and that is reject this proposal.

Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other’s competence. Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us. It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will. Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency. I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created. First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed. The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers. As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere. Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions. I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union. Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent. Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda. Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust. The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith. We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work. However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol’s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities. We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is “Less is sometimes more!” With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control. We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol. At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction. Thirdly: the extension to Parliament’s rights in this context. If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens. There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control. We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.

 Mr President, the Dehaene report contains a proposal of historic importance, namely the division of the Treaties into two parts: a part concerned with fundamental rights and the institutions which, as hitherto, can only be changed through the unanimous decision of the Intergovernmental Conference and through a procedure of ratification by the Member States; and a special part for specific policy areas which, instead of ratification, would require the agreement of the European Parliament.  In view of the fact that the Commission – and I am very grateful to Mr Barnier for this – has accepted in its proposals a division of this kind for the Amendment procedures too, it would appear faint-hearted if now Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs were to accept the two-fold division but not the distinction between the procedures. It is also necessary to introduce different procedures because, following enlargement, the European Union would otherwise lose its ability to act. To that extent, I would thank rapporteur Leinen for his remark on this subject, but I cannot unfortunately find it in his report.  I am in favour of introducing such a two-fold division of procedures, but only under a specific condition. It must be guaranteed that the abolition of the ratification procedure for specified areas of policy would not entail any weakening of the rights of the Member States and that the European Union would not acquire for itself a right to extend its powers at the expense of the constituent Member States. This can be guaranteed by means of a motion submitted by a number of colleagues and myself in which we conclude and demand that a catalogue of competences be incorporated into the basic part of the Treaty, clearly defining the competences of the European Union, clearly limiting those competences as well as encouraging application of the principle of subsidiarity.  Only in this way can the European Union, without at the same time eroding the rights of the Member States, become more able to act and efficiently limit its work to specified policy areas. I would therefore particularly ask the rapporteurs – partly in order to ensure that their report obtains a broad majority in the House – to examine these two motions sympathetically.

Mr President, thank you very much for letting me take the floor once again. I would like to tell my fellow Members a little about the issue of nominating the members of the European Court of Auditors. We carried out a procedure in the Committee on Budgetary Control, as we are instructed to do by the Rules of Procedure, and in which we were guided by the provisions of the Treaty, which state that what is most important in order to be a member of the European Court of Auditors is professional qualifications and, above all, total independence. Ten Members completed a written questionnaire, we received the answers and the respective curriculum vitae were passed on. We then carried out an individual public hearing for each proposed member, and then, behind closed doors, we held discussions, just amongst the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. In order to include the new Members, who belong to our Parliament as of 1 May since the accession countries are now legally full members of the European Union, we carried out the vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control last Monday, 3 May. The result of the voting, in the form of nine reports – and I want to make this clear now and I will explain it in a moment – is before this House. We will hold a ballot – a secret one – on nine individual reports; on the reports by the Committee on Budgetary Control, which include its recommendation concerning the candidacies. The result was that the large majority of the candidates received the approval of the majority in the committee. Two out of the ten candidates did not gain this majority, one of whom – namely the Cypriot candidate – withdrew his candidature in a letter to the Council. That leaves the Slovak candidate, who, unfortunately, did not gain the support of the majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control. I would like to make it very clear that we have a great responsibility in voting now on the reports of the Committee on Budgetary Control since the members of the European Court of Auditors are appointed for six years. There are no transitional periods like there are in other institutions. They will, therefore, belong to the European Court of Auditors for six years, and so the Committee on Budgetary Control was also very conscientious and carried out a very careful investigation. Also, everything that was carried out behind closed doors, took place in secret. I would thank all of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control for this very complex and responsible work and I now put forward these reports. I would like to make one more request: after this totally thorough procedure, it would be desirable for a future Parliament to not just be consulted on the nomination of members of the European Court of Auditors, but also to be able to give its approval to them. (Applause)
 I have two further announcements to make. In the translations of the reports in a whole range of languages an incorrect verdict of the Committee on Budgetary Control was printed, which has now been corrected. A positive verdict in the committee was recorded for Mr Molnár in the Danish, French, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Portuguese and Swedish versions. Apart from the Hungarian, all versions – and that was the situation at 11.21 a.m. – have since been corrected. I ask you to be aware that the Committee on Budgetary Control does not produce standard results of the voting, but that a verdict is in actual fact different, as I have explained. Since this is my last appearance in this Parliament, I would like to thank everyone in this House, including you, Mr President, for such fantastic cooperation and for an incredibly exciting time and I would like to wish all of you as individuals the very best for the future. Thank you very much. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this nocturnal hour and with few present to hear us, we are debating the important topic of discharge, the last on which Parliament, as at present composed, will have to take a decision. It is also the last discharge for the – current – Commission, and this is also the last time I will be taking part in a discharge procedure. So let me say a few words of thanks – to the Members of this House above all, and also in the committee, to the rapporteurs, and to our Bureau. Things have always been amicable, and I think that the great deal of work we have put in has also yielded a great deal of success. I also want to thank the Court of Auditors for its reports, on which our work has been founded, as well as the Commission and you, Commissioner. It is of course you whom we are monitoring and assessing. I think it can be said that the Commission and Parliament are more willing to engage in dialogue and are also more frank with each other, and for that I am grateful, although I found the earlier statement on Eurostat a great disappointment. The Committee on Budgetary Control will continue to shed critical light on the Commission’s activities, which is what it is meant to do. If the Commission manages to improve the flow of information still further, including within itself, if there is real transparency and real responsibility, if it succeeds in reducing unwieldy bureaucracy and is more prompt in recognising and honestly admitting where things have gone wrong and abuses have occurred, then Parliament will be less harsh in its criticisms. The reforms for which we have striven have now been set in motion; they must not be put off to another day. You yourself said, Commissioner, that there is advice from Mr Bayona de Perogordo in his excellent report. Let me put before you the three things that the public would like to see in the future Parliament: real representation of the citizens as a result of a high turnout at elections; collegial loyalty in order to avoid many of the criticisms in Mr van Hulten’s report, and – this is a personal wish of mine – to that end, a statute of our own.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by expressing my warm thanks to Mrs Avilés Perea, who mastered her difficult task as rapporteur with great diligence and thoroughness. The Committee of the Regions is the newest EU institution, and it is also a small one. In terms of its composition, it is extremely heterogeneous, at least as regards the political status and rank of its members in their home states. Could this be why we had so many difficulties with the 2001 discharge? Shortcomings and even irregularities were drawn to the attention of the Committee on Budgetary Control as it was about to vote last spring on the resolution giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions for 2001. The rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, put on the brakes and recommended the postponement of the discharge and an audit of the practices being undertaken in the COR, preferably by the European Court of Auditors – a recommendation which the plenary took up. In the meantime, the rapporteur and the committee have carried out detailed work and are now proposing that discharge be granted to the Committee of the Regions for 2001. Yet this does not mean that the dubious incidents in the COR are forgiven and forgotten. They are likely to come to light again in the context of the 2002 discharge, especially as the Court of Auditors proposes to undertake a more detailed audit, something it felt unable to do in 2001. Mrs Avilés Perea’s report takes account of a number of recommendations by OLAF and makes clear demands of the COR. There are no indications of personal enrichment or the loss of financial resources. The incorrect calculation of travel allowances has now been regulated through recoveries, although in future, the maintenance of presence lists and the calculation of members’ allowances must be carried out scrupulously and be verifiable. Payment procedures must be in line with the financial regulations. There must be respect for the institutional role of the Internal Auditor. The President of the Committee of the Regions has announced the implementation of an action plan to improve administration and management, and this includes rules on dealing with whistleblowers. Whether or not there are to be disciplinary proceedings is something for the COR itself to decide. Overall, the Committee on Budgetary Control is very concerned about the extent to which an amateurish improvisatory approach has prevailed in the administration to date. We will monitor the improvements which have been called for, and which have been pledged, benevolently but with close attention so that the 2001 discharge is right and proper, thus encouraging the COR to keep to the rules in future.

 Mr President, Commissioner, never before, in my seventeen years of membership of the Committee on Budgetary Control, has a follow-up report on a discharge which has already been granted left so many fundamental questions unanswered. They relate to openness, to the provision of prompt and comprehensive information from the Commission to Parliament and within the Commission itself, and to the assumption of responsibility by the Commissioners for abuses that have arisen. It seems that the shadow of the past is catching up with us. The rapporteur, Mr Casaca, has worked hard to produce this painstaking report. I would like to thank him in particular, as well as the committee as a whole for its outstanding work. The main issue in this report is to investigate and address the improper practices in and around the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), such as slush funds, cronyism, violations of the financial regulations, lax treatment of the mobility rules, and various other things. If the Commission had taken seriously Parliament’s warnings about Eurostat in its reports of February and March and investigated what was going on, and had informed Parliament accordingly, the discharge would have been postponed from April to October. This would not have been serious, but would have given the Commission enough time to adopt the measures that it is now trying to rush through with astonishing speed. Yet again, the bottom line is that what we have is an information shortfall. What, too, about political responsibility? So far, not one Commissioner has admitted any responsibility. Admittedly, some errors have been acknowledged, but a clear admission has yet to come. That is regrettable, in my view. Claiming ignorance is no defence against responsibility. We are therefore pushing for this supposed ignorance to be removed by ensuring that the Commissioners finally close the yawning information gap between the officials, even to the highest ranks, and the Commissioners themselves. As early as 1999, the Commission equipped itself with rules on this issue. It is apparent that they still only exist on paper, unless what Commissioner Schreyer has just told us becomes reality. I would be delighted if that were to occur. OLAF, too, cannot serve as an excuse for the Commission’s inaction. The duty to exercise proper and thorough supervision lies, after all, with the Commission. Are the internal audit reports produced by the directorates-general being disregarded and the valuable audits carried out by the internal audit service being ignored by the Commissioners? What also concerns us deeply is the way in which the whistleblowers have been treated. They have drawn attention to numerous abuses. The current rules do not guarantee them protection. Faced with all this harsh criticism, why has the committee not proposed the dismissal of the entire Commission or individual Commissioners? This is my response: it is of no benefit to Europe if the irregularities continue at Eurostat. They must be cleared up – and that means now, by this Commission. We want to support the action plan and cooperate so that there is no repetition of these incidents in future.

 Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Commissioner, Members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you, Mr Fabra Vallés, for your presentation of the Court’s annual report for 2002, and all the more for your having already presented this important document to the Committee on Budgetary Control a fortnight ago. Today, we can shed further light on certain aspects of the annual report and discuss them with you, and this begins our work on the discharge for 2002, on the foundation of the Court’s report. In considering the points that you yourself have raised, let me begin with the Statement of Assurance. You have described how the Court has refined its auditing techniques still further, and this is something we very much welcome. The fact remains, however, that, because of an error rate that may well have differed from the preceding year’s, but was still too high, no positive statement of assurance can be issued in respect of 2002 as a whole. In the areas of agriculture, the Structural Funds, internal and external policies, only the receipts have been certified, and you give a clean bill of health only to the administrative expenditure. So little was spent on pre-accession aid for the candidate countries that a positive statement of assurance does not say very much. Overall, I would say that this is an utterly deplorable result in terms of the quality of the Commission’s implementation of the Budget, even if much of the blame lies with the Member States. These aspects will certainly be reflected in Parliament’s discharge report. Secondly, it is cause for gratitude that the Court has done what Parliament wanted and introduced a chapter summarising the implementation of the Budget and containing an overall view of the receipts and outgoings. Why, we ask ourselves, are there still such large surpluses in the 2002 Budget? They may well be only half the size of the previous year’s, but I regard EUR 7 billion in unused money not as a saving, but as a deficit resulting from action not taken and hence as a failure to meet the targets set. If, year after year, in the measures managed jointly by them and the Commission, the Member States over-estimate the funds required, the Commission has to be even more determined in taking counter-measures, something that it already does, albeit to an insufficient extent, but it could, for example, submit supplementary and amending budgets. The Court’s forthright advocacy of the idea that the administration of the Development Fund should be improved by including it in the general budget is precisely what Parliament has been demanding for some years now. Thirdly, Mr Fabra Vallés, you spoke about the administrative reform and the internal audits, in which, in the light of the Eurostat affair, this House takes a particular interest. What you say sounds very positive but we doubt whether these reforms are really having any effect. Take the slogan ‘decentralising the way the Commission is run’, which, as such, I welcome. The activity reports and the guarantees given by the individual Directors-General are an improvement, but should they not also be signed by the office responsible for finance and personnel? Should there not be a clearer dividing line between the accountant and the authorising officer? Should the internal auditor, through his reports, also be in close contact with the internal audit service? The Court has devoted attention to the audit reports, but will it also cast an eye over administrative processes as a whole? The Committee on Budgetary Control will have other questions to ask about reform of the accounting and book-keeping system. Over the next few weeks, our committee will have a lot of work to do in preparing the discharge for 2002. We are very grateful to you for supplying the documentation and information that we need and for the openness with which you and all the members of the Court of Auditors have cooperated with us. Let me just briefly say something in response to your closing remarks about the Intergovernmental Conference. You will be aware that Parliament – and, in this instance, the Committee on Budgetary Control, too – believes it to be of the utmost importance that the Court of Auditors should have equal status with the other institutions. That is why you will see from the documents that, as rapporteur, I appealed to the Intergovernmental Conference to add the Court of Auditors to the list of the various institutions, thus guaranteeing the Court its proper place and ensuring that the public can see that we have the instruments and agencies to watch over how the taxpayers’ money is handled. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bösch’s report is a critical but also a very constructive one, and I congratulate him on his intensive work. Of course, we could have voted on its outcomes and possible implementation at an earlier stage if the Commission had submitted its evaluation of OLAF’s three years of work on time, as envisaged in the Regulation, instead of over nine months late. Some of the mismanagement and irregularities could then have been addressed more effectively than is possible now, at the end of the parliamentary term and the Commission’s term in office. Eurostat is a case in point. We know the background to OLAF’s establishment: an interim structure was all that could be achieved because a Treaty amendment was not envisaged at that stage. As a result, OLAF was in a paradoxical position from the outset. In its work, it is independent – we insist on that – but it is subordinate to the Commission administration in organisational terms. Nonetheless, delays, cumbersome processes and inadequate application of the OLAF Regulation by both parties – the Commission and OLAF – have regrettably characterised this agency to date. Let me cite just a few examples: its protracted recruitment process, its excessively long investigations, its failure to inform the Supervisory Committee as required, and above all the poor training and the failure to adequately respect the defence rights of the individuals under investigation. I take the Supervisory Committee’s clear statement on this latter point especially seriously, as it directly highlights the need to create a European Public Prosecutor to protect the Union’s financial interests. This House has called for such an appointment for a very long time and the Commission has now added its voice to these calls in the Convention and at the Intergovernmental Conference. I am grateful to President Prodi for now having addressed this issue in his action plan. The fundamental rights of the individual can only be guaranteed within a judicial framework based on the rule of law. Until this objective is achieved, I fully support strengthening the Supervisory Committee, both as regards the Secretariat – we need to discuss its allocation to the European Parliament budget – and also, and especially, the appointment of highly qualified, independent persons as members of the Supervisory Committee. In sum, what we need is not a new regulation but a number of amendments, as the report makes clear. We need a strong OLAF. I ask the Commission to take our demands seriously so that we can move closer to a zero tolerance policy. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to President Prodi for coming to the Committee on Budgetary Control this morning. The plan of action that he presented to us needs some commentary, and I would like, in the first instance, to deal with the continuing failure to sort out the issue of communication between the administration and the Commission – by which I mean the Commissioners, even though I can see how many measures already exist on paper; the September 1999 code of conduct, the ‘Charter for Delegated Authorising Officers’ of December 2000, and so on. I do believe that what we need in this area is not new rules, but the application of the ones that already exist, and that is what I want to press for. Secondly, it is clear that new mechanisms have to be created to do this. President Prodi, let me warn you most urgently not to create even more bodies, but instead to strengthen the ones we have and implement reforms where these are needed. I see little point in this new machinery to collect all the information on possible instances of fraud. I see no point in having a body to uncover financial irregularities. I do not see that there is any need to set up a management committee as a replacement for OLAF’s Supervisory Committee. You have touched on a great deal, and there is good in that, but the issue of whistleblowing still has to be sorted out. Reference has already been made to the fact that it is no longer a live issue. There is so much for us to do together, and so I urge you, before you issue the communication, to take Parliament seriously, to talk with us, to have a look at the Bösch report, so that we do not go down false trails. To do so would harm the European budget and hence the European taxpayer.

 Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control welcomes the report by Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos and congratulates the rapporteurs on it. Our opinion sets out a few points from our area of activity on which we would like clarification. The first is that, in line with its institutional status, the Court of Auditors should be included among the institutions listed in the draft constitution, and its functions should be set out more clearly later on in it. Secondly, the giving of discharge – including to the agencies – should be referred to under the Budgetary and Financial Principles, in order to make it clearer that it is Parliament that exercises democratic control. Thirdly, as regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we recommend, on the basis of the original motion put to the Convention by Parliament’s delegation, that the establishment of this public prosecutor’s office be put in clear terms rather than being left as an optional provision, and that the present unanimity principle in the Council be replaced by the legislative procedure, in other words, by qualified majority voting. We believe that these recommendations would help bring about a Europe of freedom, security and justice in the Constitution. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the news. The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes discharge for the 2001 Budget in respect of all institutions except the Committee on the Regions, which still has until the autumn to finish its homework, that is, it must clear up the contradictions in travel and subsistence payments and other points and undergo a comprehensive audit. It is also proposed postponing discharge for five agencies that receive money from the EU Budget until their constituent acts are brought into line with the new Financial Regulation. Let me begin, however, by thanking all the rapporteurs for their conscientious and responsible work and the members of the committees for their constructive cooperation and in particular the committee secretariat for its excellent support. We have broken new ground with the discharge procedure for 2001 because rules have come into force that are not always clear and may lead to difficulties. The first question concerns the vote during the April meeting. The Committee on Budgetary Control has two options: first, to propose the discharge be granted or, second, to propose the discharge be postponed. If, in the second case, the plenary were to reject the proposal, discharge would be considered granted. That is an implicit vote of approval, which in my opinion does no justice to the weight of the discharge. What would then remain of an original stringent decision that would have to be watered down by being adjusted to such an indirect discharge decision? Are the accounts in that case still correct, now that, in contrast with the former case, we have to provide accounts for every discharge report, something which seems questionable? All the discharges must nevertheless be published in the Official Journal. Yesterday evening the Committee on Budgetary Control had to comply with another new rule. All the amendments tabled for the plenary had to be examined. How that is supposed to be done is nowhere explained. We therefore proceeded pragmatically and noted the Committee’s previous vote in the case of motions that were retabled, taking a vote on new motions, of which there were only a few. One thing is quite clear – the plenary and the groups are the masters of events. Our committee can make proposals but not set parameters. I think this new rule complicates the discharge procedure. Without the innovations referred to, I might have voted for a postponement in the Casaca report, because the rapporteur has listed the Commission’s failings clearly and in detail and the other rapporteurs have also commented on them. This concerns the book-keeping and accounting system in particular, where staff decisions were dubious and where reforms were tackled too late and half-heartedly despite repeated reminders from the Court of Auditors. If I am voting for discharge despite all that, it is because I did not want to risk the scenario I described at the beginning. The Commission must not take this as carte blanche, but it must follow up our demands thoroughly, speedily and above all transparently. There is not much time until the next discharge, which we start on in November. We are looking for positive results by then, or all our complaints will be repeated with stricter conditions attached. The points are mentioned here: proceedings in respect of Eurostat are still not completed, although steps have been initiated, and the committee’s demand is that all the options for presenting the accounts and their reform should be examined by outside experts. They must then be discussed in a hearing. A motion to this effect will be presented again today in extended form. I ask you to vote in favour. Let me thank, once again, all who have been involved in this big piece of work.

 Mr President, in December 2001 the Commission adopted its Green Paper on the criminal-law protection of the financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Prosecutor. This provoked a broad debate among academics and practitioners beyond legal circles. That was also its intention and I would like to thank the Commission for it. The European Parliament, too, got involved in the debate. Even before the Green Paper appeared, it called in several resolutions for better protection for EU finances through the establishment of a European prosecutor for financial matters, who would deal with the growing number of cases of cross-border crime affecting the EU budget. The time is ripe. The EU is on the threshold of enlargement, with ten new Member States acceding in the coming year. The Community budget will continue to grow, administration of European money will become even more complex. At the same time, cross-border crime will increase as modern technology makes it increasingly professional. The territorial fragmentation of criminal law systems and the difficulties in judicial cooperation between Member States are the reason why criminals are seldom caught and even more seldom convicted. The statistics show that the EU budget loses as much as EUR 1 000 million every year to internationally active organised criminals. It is possible that this money funds other criminal structures. Cigarette smuggling is the best example. European taxpayers’ money is lost for actual EU purposes. I repeat: lost, since even today we in Europe still do not have efficient structures for the prosecution of EU financial crime. The Council has recognised the danger in so far as it anchored the protection of financial interests in the first pillar of the Treaty of Maastricht and enshrined cooperation with the Commission in the Treaty of Amsterdam. With today’s report from the Committee on Budgetary Control, Parliament joins the 72 opinions that the Commission has so far received from various quarters and considered concerning the Green Paper. Please note that our report is an own-initiative report, not a legislative one. We on the committee have taken time to make a thorough analysis of the subject of ‘establishing a European Prosecutor’; we commissioned experts to make external studies and arranged a hearing with the national parliaments and representatives of civil society. In this report, we are now putting forward options and calling on the Commission to make improvements, especially with regard to safeguarding basic rights and rights of defence, supervision of the European Public Prosecutor and his links with existing structures. We want links with the existing structures of OLAF, Eurojust and Europol. We want in that way to avoid duplication, but at the same time we want the Prosecutor to be an efficient instrument for the protection of EU finances at European level. There are clear proposals as to how the future European Prosecutor could cooperate with the national authorities in the Member States. The principle of subsidiarity is the maxim here. All the questions of how the Public Prosecutor’s Office should operate can then be settled by secondary law. I would like to sincerely thank my colleagues from my committee, and also those from the Committees on Constitutional Affairs, Legal and Home Affairs and Petitions for their positive and constructive cooperation. Their proposals have been incorporated into this report. Our main concern is that an appropriate legal basis for the creation of this Public Prosecutor’s Office should be laid down in the Treaty and that the Council should appoint this new organ with the assent of Parliament. The revision of the treaties remains an essential prerequisite for this, because only a treaty reform can legitimise the proposal. We call on the European Convention to provide for this legal basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to protect the EU’s financial interests now so that it can be placed on the agenda for the 2004 intergovernmental conference. As I said, the time is ripe. We want the means to be created in the European Union and for the European Union to strengthen and secure the protection of the Community’s financial interests before enlargement takes place. We all want an area of freedom, security and justice, where a stop is put to fraud and corruption at the expense of the EU budget and therefore of the European taxpayer. (Applause

 Mr President, the fact is that it was only at the weekend that a note reached me; it dates back to last year and I am utterly astonished by it. The reason for my astonishment is that this note had not previously come to light following the many questions we had put to the Commission, particularly concerning the book-keeping and accounts, and because it is obviously not through the Commission that it has found its way to me. I do not know whether other Members have had a copy, and have not, as yet, had the chance to seek further information about this. For now, though, that is of secondary importance. What is important, though, is the fact – which I note with amazement – that the Director-General of internal audit is due to join us for the meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. today. I know nothing about this, though, and he has not even been invited. I have tried to reach him by phone in order to get some information about this note, but have not, for the moment, been able to do so, as he was in a meeting. Discharge will not, of course, be under discussion at this mini-conference – that will be dealt with in plenary in April – but this is, of course, vitally important right now. In eight days' time, the committee will have to vote on what we are going to do about giving discharge, and on what proposals we are going to put to plenary. This really does make it a matter of urgency that we should have information about this. I really do not know any more when I am meant to do this if we are to be able to deal with this properly in committee. Although we will, self-evidently, be discussing it this evening, it is already my view that we should know what is going on when such a thing lands on the table, and that we should discuss it among ourselves.

 Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, I congratulate you on this ambitious project and have the following questions. The new system must be operational from 2005. What do you propose doing in the meantime, since the Court of Auditors has been voicing strong criticism of the existing bookkeeping and accounting system since 1994? You know that Parliament will very likely be dealing with these problems once they have been put before the Committee on Budgetary Control. How much longer will it take after 2005 before everything is really operational if the new chief accountant – probably supported by the committee you referred to – will then actually have to guarantee that it will work?

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Fabra Vallés, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my warm congratulations to the Court of Auditors on twenty-five years of its existence and on last week's celebrations, which were entirely worthy of the occasion. Today's discussion on the Court's annual report for 2001, which you, Mr Fabra Vallés, thankfully presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control as long ago as the beginning of November, makes it possible for us to examine the same key areas that have already been mentioned – notably the enormous Budget surplus of over EUR 15 billion, the significance of which is that 16% of the resources allocated were not able to be spent even after the 2000 financial year had come to an end with all of 14% of funds unused and left over. We are very much in favour of frugality, but not at the expense of objectives that have been decided on, unless the capacity for implementing them had been overestimated from the outset! In Chapter I, the Court reiterates the call it made in the previous year for a supplementary and amending Budget to be presented in good time. The Commission's response to this may well be technically correct, but it is not the right one politically. There is still a great deal of work to be done here. What the Court has to say in Chapter 9 of the Statement of Assurance is most interesting, but, at the same time, gives rise to grave concern. Again, with the exception of a few areas, certification of the accounts is withheld. The question arises of whether the top notch on this yardstick will ever be reached. In terms of discharge, the really important things will be a series of items such as Commission reform, financial management and the new Financial Regulation. The reliability of the Commission's accounting system has been the subject of vigorous debate, which the media have broadcast far and wide. The Committee on Budgetary Control was prevented from hearing the arguments of the Commission's accounting officer, who has since been suspended. What we now read in the Court's report– on pages 308 ff. for example – paints a pretty grim picture of deficits that have been present in the Commission's book-keeping and accounting procedures for years. Putting together the Court's criticisms in its reports from 1994 onwards, the result is proof of the culpably negligent way in which the Commission goes about remedying these serious defects. According to its current plans, the Commission intends to progressively remove them, but it will be 2005 by the time it will have done it, so the Court of Auditors and Parliament will have many years more checking up to do. I will end with two questions. The first is whether 2001 saw an improvement in Budget implementation. It is the discharge resolution that will provide the answer to that. The second is this: under the Treaty, it is the Commission that is responsible for the management of the Budget as a whole. The new Financial Regulation gives its Directorates-General decentralised responsibility. Who, though, in the Commission, is responsible for the monitoring of the whole within the Commission itself? The individual Directors-General, the Budget Directorate-General, or the accounting officer? In any case, it is, above all, you, Commissioner Schreyer, in your role as Budget Commissioner, to whom we shall continue to address our questions. (Applause)
Theato (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Mr Martin has invested a great deal of time and effort in this report, for which I wish to express my utmost appreciation. The rapporteur and I also had some good discussions. The granting of discharge is Parliament's most important prerogative as a monitoring body when it comes to the assessment of how the budget has been managed by the executive – that is, primarily, by the Commission. This is a political act and not only the closure of the accounts, important as that is. Using the reports of the Court of Auditors and other information, some, incidentally, from the Commission itself, we look to see if the objectives set have been met with proper and economic use of the funds allocated. We highlight weak points in order that they may be rectified and also avoided in the forthcoming budget. Where the three discharge options, which the rapporteur has elucidated – grant, deferment, and refusal – are concerned, I think it right to specify time periods, so that there will not be two discharge procedures running in parallel, as often happened in the past, but so that one procedure is concluded before the beginning of the next, and so that the two stages can function. Mrs Schreyer, I believe that the timeframe is indeed sufficient – if the time taken up by the summer recess is included – for constructive solutions to be arrived at in due time. I have to tell the rapporteur that I cannot, however, accept that discharge should be deemed to have been granted if, in April, the plenary rejects a proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control that it be deferred. Such a refusal may have contradictory motives behind it and does not express Parliament's unambiguous will. I might add that the Legal Service's opinion says the same thing. Granting discharge would be the wrong answer to the question put, and, for those to be given discharge, it would be a second-class discharge, being granted en passant
. I would therefore have liked the proposal, in its three parts, to be sent back to the Committee on Budgetary Control. Should the discrepancies between the resolution and the result of the vote, as described in paragraph 3 of the new Article 5a, occur, the Committee on Budgetary Control should be given the task of removing them and submitting the resolution to the plenary for a second time. However, as has already been mentioned, my group's amendments have been withdrawn. I must therefore rely on my own experience when I say, as I have done before, that, although there is in the report much that I can accept, I do not feel able to vote in favour of it if no other way is found of dealing with the issue of suspension and hence of the grant of discharge.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schreyer, if we are to take the Commission at its word when it makes these statements, then the new Financial Regulation is leading us into a new era of financial management, in which we will be able to resolve the problems of the past. We will simply have to wait and see. What we can, unfortunately, see at the present time is that the new era is being ushered in by the weakening of Parliament's rights. The new Financial Regulation's rules of implementation, should, according to previous rules, have been decided on in agreement with Parliament. In law, the Commission is no longer obliged even to listen to Parliament. Of course, Mrs Schreyer, we welcome the way that you are doing that any way, as these rules of implementation do not apply to the Commission alone, but are in future to be applicable to all the EU institutions. Let me pick out a number of points on which we should be asking the Commission to think again, if not to make improvements. Take the accounting officer: according to this proposal, the institutions have to select their accounting officers from the ranks of the civil service. Applications from outside will not be possible. This means that we are in fact spoiling our opportunities for even considering external candidates. You have told us, Mrs Schreyer, that the Statute prevents this. Let me turn to the accounting officer's functional independence, on which depends the reliability and credibility of the figures we have to present to the public in their capacity as contributors to the European Union. The draft has nothing to say about this. Why do you not give the accounting officer a right of appeal against attempts at interference in his work, as you have to the internal auditor? There are other aspects that cause me concern; one example is the so-called panel on financial irregularities. I hope that is not meant to compete with OLAF or even interfere with its work. Conflicts of interest are given a comprehensive and appropriate definition in the Financial Regulation, but the rules of implementation make it look as if this can be simply evaded. Finally, Article 84's provisions on the waiver or claims open the door to waiving the recovery of debts. It will be the European taxpayer who will have to cough up for these decisions, by paying additional contributions. Thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, for the speed with which he has worked under enormous pressure of time.

 Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating both rapporteurs on this debate and on these reports. Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to say that fourteen committees submitted opinions, so just reading all that and sorting through it was a great labour, Mr Corbett. Many congratulations on your achievement. For our part, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control worked on two issues. One has to do with the Court of Auditors, and you have taken it on board in its entirety, notably the appointment of the Court's members as carried out by us in the committee and in plenary, which has been customary ever since Mr Lamassoure and Mr Bourlanges produced their reports in 1992 and 1995 respectively. For the sake of the rules' clarity, that now has to be firmly established. The second issue has to do with OLAF, and gave rise to much controversy as to how members should be treated by OLAF or should act in regard to it. At the time, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control had delivered an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which, however, found its way into plenary by another route. Our opinion was thus dropped at the time. This then resulted in a complaint. I think that now the time has come when we can consistently and properly put members in such a position as regards how they deal with OLAF and act in relation to it, that they are not lumped together with the administration. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has now tabled an amendment on this, and I wish to support it. In the final analysis, it covers the amendment by the Committee on Budgetary Control which you have been unable to deal with in your report. I would be happy if we could vote for it, and then we would no longer need the complaint and the appeal.

Mr President, I wish to endorse Mr Posselt's comments. On the one hand, we have a packed agenda for Tuesday and Wednesday. We have night sittings and virtually no opportunity even to meet the visitors' groups who come here. We have very little opportunity to do any of the paperwork which still arises during the week of plenary. On the other hand, we have the scrappy arrangements on a Thursday afternoon, when time is wasted. If I look around, I see far more visitors in the galleries than Members in the chamber. There are empty seats everywhere. I believe that it will damage the reputation of this Parliament if we continue with such uneven timetabling. I would urge you to give this matter very careful consideration when drawing up the timetable for next year. I have a draft copy in various versions and it seems to me that we should be dealing more efficiently and more economically with the time available to us. I would very much appreciate it if you could give this matter serious thought and take it into account during planning. Secondly, I would like to address a question to Mr Nielson, with your permission. Mr Nielson, you were just talking about the budget arrangements which are the basis for your endeavours in the field of food aid. Of course, I would like a little more explanation on this point, if I may. I have been dealing with the budget in the committee which I represent for months. We know that it is still with the Council at present, but Parliament, too, has a number of items which it would like to include in the budget. We see that it is taking time. Nonetheless, perhaps you could give us a clearer idea of what this means for you and your area of work. I think that would be helpful for us.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we postponed the vote on this report from yesterday to today because we were waiting for an official response from the Council. That was the reason given on Monday by the chairman of the PSE Group, Mr Baron Crespo. We went along with that. However, we still do not have an official answer now. An unofficial, possible answer from the Council, which was given to me today in the form of an unofficial translation, is what I actually have in front of me as chairman of the committee. I do not think that it is fair to either the Council or the committee, which has after all not even been able to examine this material, for us now to set about the discharge procedure and decide yes or no or whether to postpone a decision. I think a reasonable course of action is to wait for the following year, for 2001, where budget lines are already shown for the foreign and security policy and home affairs, and in the meantime to reflect calmly on the discharge problem both on our own and in discussion with the Council. That is why I would ask that these matters be dealt with in a clear and transparent procedure in the committee responsible, so that we can also make a well-founded judgment. I would therefore ask our rapporteur, and also the PSE Group, to abandon this very hasty, indeed perhaps over hasty, procedure.
Theato (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start with the observation that we have six reports, all of which recommend discharge – with the exception of one part in Mrs Morgan's report, which we have already discussed. I think that is something we have not seen for a long time. I want to congratulate the rapporteurs most warmly, but would also like to mention that the highest levels of the Commission were represented in many of our meetings, and this made management easier – something mentioned by you, Mrs Schreyer. To give or withhold discharge is actually the greatest power Parliament possesses, in which Parliament is superior to the Council, and that is why it is a highly political instrument. Let me emphasise that again. This time, the judgment on the way that the Budget was managed in 2000 was indeed lenient, especially, too, in the report on the Commission. So I would just like to mention three points, and briefly. One is the issue of the large surplus that remains. I am less concerned about whether this money reverts to the Member States or is set off, than that it should not be used to achieve political objectives, especially in the areas of structural policy and enlargement, and that makes me very vigilant. There is room for improvement here, and another surplus of this sort for 2001 will not be acceptable. The second point is the Statement of Assurance that the Court of Auditors did not grant. This instrument is evidently not that fully applicable. It is very difficult for us, in the absence of percentages of errors, to judge whether errors have been committed, and how many. The third issue I wish to address is that of monitoring, in which field the Commission, being responsible for the Member States and also, already now, for the candidate countries – one can take Chapter 28 as an example – must take great care that the European Union's financial interests are effectively safeguarded. I therefore see the Green Paper on the creation of a European public prosecutor as showing the way ahead.
Theato (PPE-DE

 Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. 
– (DE)
 Mr President, let me begin by saying that it is a great pleasure and an honour for me to address the House under your Presidency for the first time. I should like to make it clear that I am speaking primarily on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control. The rapporteurs – whom I also wish to congratulate on their work – have both pointed out that the Committee on Budgetary Control gave this matter very careful consideration and this is reflected in the reports. We did so because we want the proceedings of the Convention to be a success. This is our unanimous view, and I would like to make that clear. On this basis, we will be voting for the supplementary and amending budget which is contained in the report submitted to this House by the Committee on Budgets. However, it must be clear that this extraordinary budgetary procedure is a one-off; under no circumstances can it constitute a precedent for the future. This has been emphasised by the rapporteurs. Furthermore, the budgetary transactions must be conducted with maximum transparency and clarity, not least in order to justify the trust and hopes invested in the Convention. Although the Committee on Budgets is satisfied with the agreed procedures, a number of key issues remain unresolved as regards budgetary control. We have set these out in our statement, which was drafted in great haste, and we note that some of these points have been included in the resolution, for which we are grateful. The main concern, from our point of view, is the granting of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget which, under the Treaty, is the prime and sole decision of Parliament and is normally non-negotiable. Yet Article 20 of the Council Decision on the financing of the Convention states that the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States shall give a discharge to the Secretary-General of the Convention, after Parliament, the Council and the Commission shall have consented thereto. What exactly does this mean, given that the terms assent or avis conforme 
are not defined in the various language versions? What procedures are envisaged for this process? A satisfactory solution has yet to be found in this respect. The second issue which inevitably arises is Parliament's access to documents. The Treaty clearly states that the Parliament must receive all documents and information which it deems necessary to the discharge resolution procedure. Yet Article 4 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets merely refers to the Court of Auditors in this context. This does not reflect the spirit of the Treaty. As has already been noted, this is a sui generis 
procedure which diverges in part from the Treaty. Nonetheless, Parliament must have full and free access to all documents. I welcome Article 5 of the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Budgets, which stresses that budgetary procedures, in particular on discharge, will have to comply with ordinary law, should the Convention's remit be extended beyond the period originally projected. I would like to reiterate my hope that we will be able to adopt this report tomorrow and thus get the Convention off to a good start .

Mr President, what I have to say is addressed particularly to Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner. A fortnight ago, you described me as a champion of the European State Financial Prosecutor. I take that as a title of honour and might perhaps apply the term to you yourself, as we have now of course achieved what we wanted at the beginning of the nineties – a Green Paper and consequent Treaty amendment. I believe, though, that the timetable has to be tightened up a bit, as what you have said indicates that such a State Prosecutor will be in place only in 2006 or 2007. So, we are on your side, but, as we want to speed the process up, I would like to ask you to find the time to enable us to achieve the objective, and, with all the subsidiarity, please see to it that the process is not ponderous, slow or inefficient. That is important; it will enable us to really move ahead with setting up the State Prosecutor. The citizens out there demand it, and we are doing something for Europe if we make it clear that it is Europe's money that we are protecting.
Theato (PPE-DE

 Madam President, what Mr Heaton-Harris has just said is to some extent correct. Mr Heaton-Harris was referring to a section about the interim solution of an internal public prosecutor, whereas the other amendments to the proposal for a directive have gone through. I do not think that this referral back is necessarily the way to solve the problem created by the vote. I cannot say, and in the light of the voting in committee, I cannot see how this report should be further amended.
Theato (PPE-DE
),  
rapporteur.
 – (DE) 
Mr President, protection of the Community's financial interests is a concept that the citizen out there finds difficult to understand. But it is of deep concern to him, as someone who pays his taxes, that his money should be used for the development and extension of a united Europe and that it should not be misused or employed for the purposes of fraud or other kinds of criminal activity. He has every right to demand that the European institutions to which he entrusts his money will handle it carefully and that, should frauds be committed, these will be detected and punished. The message we must get across is that we are using every available means to justify the citizen's trust. The means to hand have, though, been blunt weapons to date, and there has been increased leakage from the Community budget due to criminal practices – figures show it as having doubled to over EUR 2 billion in the past year. The percentage of undetected crime, may well, by the way, be even higher. Despite better detection of fraud, judicial cooperation across frontiers is limping along, far behind multinational organised crime. The Council, the Commission and Parliament have been lamenting this situation for years, but little or nothing has as yet been done about it. The agreement on protection of the Community's financial interests, signed in Cannes all of six years ago, and the protocols appended to it, have still not been ratified by all the Member States and are therefore not in force. Despite all the appeals and resolutions by Parliament, and several summit declarations by the Council, there is still no common European legal area to protect the Community budget, indeed, not even an unambiguous definition of the concept of fraud against Community funds. Still less are any investigations carried out or punitive sentences handed down, which must be in equal measure effective, proportionate and deterrent. This blockade situation has now seen the Commission produce a proposal for a directive which recalls elements of the 1995 agreement and incorporates parts of them in the protocols, a proposal which, incidentally, Parliament had already made before the 1995 Summit. The Commission, rightly, bases its proposal upon Article 280(4) of the Treaty of Amsterdam under which the Community is obliged to play an active part in protecting its funds. This should circumvent the sterile debate about allocation to the first or third pillar of the Treaty, particularly as the Treaty of Nice affirms that the protection of the Community's finances belongs in the first pillar. So we should not lose ourselves in legal analyses, but send a clear signal. For us, the criminal-law protection of European funds against criminal misuse is a serious matter. We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for the harmonisation of national legislation. It can, though, only be a first step towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office to protect Community financial interests, something that was called for at the IGC for the Treaty of Nice but was not, unfortunately, actually discussed. Mrs Schreyer, we are waiting impatiently for the Green Paper from the Commission on this subject. It would have been a good thing if we had already had this Green Paper together with the proposal for a directive. In order to make good this deficiency, the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control call for the next revision of the Treaties to include the establishment of a European State Prosecutor's Office, on the corpus juris
 model and appertaining to the first pillar. The course must be set for this as early as the Laeken Summit. The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes, as an intermediate step without amending the Treaty, the establishment of an internal financial prosecutor in accordance with the three-phase model in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men. As has already been said, we welcome the Commission's proposal, but call for an effective instrument, that is to say, a regulation rather than a directive. Why? Directives commit the Member States to objectives, whilst regulations prescribe the instruments they are to use to achieve those objectives. The proposal for a directive is meant to insert into the criminal law of all the Member States a standard definition of offences such as fraud, corruption, money-laundering etc. to the detriment of the Community Budget. There is no doubt that a regulation is the legal instrument to be preferred in order to avoid new confusion of the sort that there has been in the past. I strongly invite Parliament, the Commission and the Council to now go down this necessary political road together. I ask you to adopt my report, on which no amendments have been tabled.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Karlsson, today you are presenting your annual report as President of the Court of Auditors, together with those Members of the Court still in office. This is the last time you will present the report, as you are leaving office, as are a number of other Members of the Court. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the retiring Members of the Court both personally and on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control for the years of excellent and effective cooperation and mutual trust under your presidency, and also under the previous presidency of Professor Friedmann, who is also retiring. There have occasionally been differences of opinion, but I believe that we have always managed to cooperate well, and we have, above all, performed a control function that has ultimately benefited the taxpayer. So once again, many thanks. The Annual Report of the Court before us today also demonstrates that we have made some further progress. I only want to highlight a couple of points. The most striking point is the large surplus of own resources: EUR 11.6 million or over 14% of the budget has not been spent. The finance ministers are, of course, delighted, as this means that they will have to pay less to the EU next year, but we in the Committee on Budgetary Control are concerned to know which of the objectives that we have set ourselves have not been achieved. I believe that the Commission would be well advised – and I understand from the press that there will be surpluses again this year – to get to work on supplementary and rectifying budgets so that the money available is really spent on achieving objectives. The complex and cumbersome nature of the legal framework and the extent of the controls therefore involved are also a matter of concern both for the Parliament and for the Court of Auditors, and, as Commissioner Schreyer has just said, for the Commission too. We need to work to simplify things as a matter of urgency, so that the public can also obtain funding, rather than say, ‘It is so complicated. I do not want any money from the European Union’. Controls need to be proportionate but also to be effective, to lead to positive outcomes and to have a preventive effect. My last point is the positive statement of assurance, the SOA. Anyone looking for concrete figures or percentages in relation to payments will be disappointed. Once again, the Court has not mentioned any concrete figures. This House had actually pressed for that. The Court now wants to bring forward a refined method of producing this positive statement of assurance. We are more than happy to cooperate on this, but we also have to look and analyse where errors are due to the Member States and where they are the Commission's responsibility. The Commission is ultimately responsible, and it must accept this responsibility. I would like to thank you once again, Mr Karlsson, for your excellent cooperation, and I would like to wish all the retiring Members and you personally all the best for the future. (Applause)

Mr President, I would like to make a few short remarks on the procedure. In accordance with Article 247 of the Treaty, the Council has on this occasion, after consulting Parliament, to appoint nine members of the Court of Auditors. Four of the appointments are re-appointments by France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. The members concerned are to be reappointed for a term of six years. Three Members are new appointments by Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom. Two are to take over for the remaining four years of the term from their predecessors, who have left office early. Denmark and Sweden are the countries in question here. Article 247(6) of the Treaty makes this possible. In accordance with rule 35 of the Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Budgetary Control, being the competent committee, was entrusted by the President of Parliament with the examination of the nominees to the Court of Auditors. On 10 September and 8/9 October, these examinations took place in public session. This was followed by a brief in-camera discussion and then candidates were voted on individually by secret ballot. Candidates were, of course, examined as individuals. The result of the examination and the secret ballot that then took place was that we had voted in favour of all nominated members and also recommend them to this House.

 Mr President, I should like to address Commissioner Schreyer. I am rather surprised to hear her say I wrote her a strongly worded letter. She quotes me as having written that she should kindly come to the Committee on Budgetary Control. That cannot be true. I wrote a businesslike letter in which I asked her to come to us in the Committee for Budgetary Control in accordance with our agreement between the Commission and Parliament. If Mrs Schreyer has other commitments, I do, however, assume that she is able to send a senior official to give the Committee the information it requires. The letter has no other meaning. Mrs Schreyer, I am somewhat astonished that you read the letter in that way. It was entirely businesslike. I just wanted to explain that. Thank you.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission says it cannot cope with the ever growing number of Community programmes and their implementation with its statutory number of staff. That may be right. It means the Commission must delegate and decentralise. Various models have in the past proved unsuitable or failures. Either they were not financially transparent, like the minibudgets, or they were conducive to fraud like the TAOs, which is why Parliament demanded their abolition. Now the Commission is presenting a proposal for a regulation for the statute of so-called executive agencies, which the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has just explained. I should like to congratulate him on his very detailed treatment of this proposal. I should like to underline a number of important points in his report. The Commission must provide a precise list of the tasks to be transferred, whether they are public or non-public and the type of executive agency to which they are to be transferred. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the promised handbook about that. But it must be clear that responsibility for the proper and economic execution of the transferred tasks lies with the Commission, which is subject to discharge by Parliament, which means there can be no discharge for the agencies themselves. Parliament must be provided with all the information and documents it requires for the purpose without delay. The agencies are also subject to scrutiny by the Court of Auditors and, where appropriate, also by OLAF. The Commission is also legally liable for the executive agencies, since they are not anchored in the Treaty as institutions in their own right. The agencies must be evaluated within not more than three years to check they are operating as they should. Finally, all contracts with outside agencies must be limited in time. Mr Bourlanges has just mentioned that. The framework regulation makes no provision for their term to be extended. But I think there ought to be provision for that. It is at all events important that at least 25% of executive agency staff should be seconded Commission officials in order to ensure internal supervision of administrative tasks and to see that the Commission’s responsibilities are fulfilled.

 Mr President, I should like to expressly thank you for pointing out that the rapporteur’s speaking time must not be used to express personal opinions – let alone in such a sharp way that is almost defamatory! I should like to protest that I as an MP, which is what I am – I shall be speaking on behalf of my group later – get what amounts to a ban on speaking for expressing an opinion on the subject that I have never concealed. I also have the right to sign for the group amendments that my group supports. Please also note that a rapporteur also has to maintain a certain neutrality and represent the opinion of the committee. I am speaking here as a Member of Parliament and not as the chair, and I have not signed anywhere as chair. I must ask that these be kept separate and that the work not be confused in this way. We actually have quite a good climate in the committee. I am rather shaken by the way things are proceeding here this evening!

 Mr President, the present Financial Regulation is out of date. It no longer meets the requirements of modern financial management. The Commission has put forward a proposal for a new Financial Regulation based on the principles of decentralised responsibility and transparency. The two rapporteurs, Mr Dell’Alba and Mr van Hulten, have worked through the proposal in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control and tabled amendments. They deserve praise and recognition for this. However, my group finds a number of points still open. Firstly, the Commission’s most recent report on combating fraud in the year 2000 showed a massive increase in fraud and irregularities compared to the previous year. Around EUR 2 billion were lost. Experience shows that at best 15% to 20% of the losses can be recovered. In such circumstances, is there any sense in abolishing preventive ex ante
 checks by independent financial control? We do not want a return to schematic centralised preliminary controls that took away responsibility and created a false sense of security. Rather, on the basis of efficient risk analyses and random checks, independent financial controllers should in future help to ensure decentrally that taxpayers’ money is not spent illegally from the outset. Secondly: with more responsibility at all levels, it will in future be possible to hold financial actors liable for negligence or deliberate breaches of the financial regulations. Our motion here is designed to create a fair procedure by means of an independent body for all institutions. On the matter of independence: we are astonished to note that the Commission in its proposal for the new Financial Regulation has quietly deleted the independent right of action for internal auditors that is enshrined in the present Financial Regulation. We should like to restore this again through a motion. The final point: the Advisory Committee on Procurements and Contracts. This is the advisory body that must be consulted before contracts are awarded. At the last session in Strasbourg, this House resolved to reform this procedure. I think we will lose credibility if we now call for the body to be abolished 14 days later.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of the negotiations on the proposal for a regulation on public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Committee on Budgets considered an opinion on this which I myself drafted. I would like to reiterate the basic principles of that opinion, which are still valid today. We highlighted three main points, the first of these being transparency and openness, which are a fundamental requirement for any system of democratic control. These principles require an administration to be legitimate, efficient, responsible and meaningful for the public. Furthermore, they provide protection against arbitrary actions and the abuse of power. In addition, they contribute to the exposure, punishment and prevention of irregularities and fraud, phenomena that the Commission in particular has been very much subject to in the past. The second main point is the statement that documents produced by the institutions should be made public as a matter of principle. Any necessary exceptions to this principle should be justified. This has now been firmly established. Furthermore, I believed at that time that it was not appropriate to draw up an extensive catalogue listing existing legal provisions, which would only lead to doubts and disputes. The third main point is the public's desire for their rights to be respected in practice by guaranteeing the existence of an accessible registry, as is being requested now, and also, by means of the Internet, to respond swiftly to requests for documents and to justify any refusal of such a request, and last but not least to use the language of the applicant. I would also like to see a coordinating body facilitating all this. We shall see how this works in practice. I am pleased to see that the basic requirements have been established, even if not in full as yet. That can be covered in the revised version. I also believe that the framework agreement should be revised to bring it in line with the requests we have made about openness and relations between the institutions.

Mr President, this misunderstanding has already been cleared up in the Committee on Budgetary Control and I am therefore most surprised that it should be raised yet again. We discussed this quite clearly during the vote in committee. The matter was clarified and I therefore assumed that plenary would also understand that the English version applies and that the other languages also refer to “competent authorities”. This new demand is therefore somewhat beyond me. (Applause)

Yesterday, the State Secretary responsible, Mr Malmberg, informed me that to his great regret he cannot be with us today. I regret this all the more as there will probably be a debate about Sweden's national budget, and he will not be with us here. Could you please tell us who is representing the Swedish Presidency in today's debate at political level? Thank you. (Applause)

 Mr President, this week, the Commission should be granted discharge for the 1999 financial year. That is what the Committee on Budgetary Control recommended by a clear majority last week, in line with the proposal put forward by our rapporteur, Freddy Blak, to whom I should like to pay tribute for his excellent work. However, last week's recommendation was made in the expectation that the Commission would provide final clarification on a number of outstanding points. I know that the decision of many of my colleagues – and indeed my own too – here in the House will depend on this taking place. What are these issues? Let me sum them up in four key phrases. The first is the Fléchard case. Ms Schreyer, you have just stated clearly that the Commission would not proceed in this way today. I am gratified to hear it. But let me remind you that although you were all good enough to come to the Committee – and I thank you for that – it was rather irksome that you could not bring yourselves to respond in such unequivocal terms in the Committee. It would have made things much easier for us – for both sides – if you had done so. But I must say that we are looking to the future, and we will be able to boost confidence more effectively through openness than by wasting words and ultimately being none the wiser. My second key phrase is the Statement of Assurance. This is the sixth time in succession that a negative Statement of Assurance has been issued by the Court of Auditors, despite some improvements in a number of areas. It is not enough for the Commission to respond to Parliament's repeated calls for the error rates to be reduced by saying that it will do its best. No, we want tangible results. The DAS must be positive by 2002. This House is prepared to work with the Commission and the Court of Auditors to achieve this goal. The third key phrase is access to information. Many people's hopes of the Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament have been disappointed. I was sceptical from the outset, but as the Chairman of the Committee, I ensured that the provisions of the Agreement were strictly adhered to. Yet the Commission still failed to provide all the information requested. The long list of reports requested but not received, contained in the Annex to Mr Blak's report, speaks for itself. Ultimately, Ms Schreyer, the Commission is cutting off its nose to spite its face. You cannot really expect that when in doubt, Parliament will intercede and defend you from unjustified attacks unless you provide us with the necessary information first. And my last point: This House has called on the Commission repeatedly and with a broad majority to put forward proposals on the immediate introduction of a European Public Prosecutor's office. Its first task should be to deal with fraud within the European institutions. The previous speakers have also raised this issue. On this basis, a European Public Prosecutor's office could be introduced immediately and without any amendment to the Treaties. This was recommended by the five wise men in their report on reforming the Commission, as well as by OLAF's Supervisory Committee. Parliament gave the Commission until the end of March to state its position on this issue. Ms Schreyer, I asked you about this issue during the last part-session. Will I finally get a clear statement from you today? The Committee on Budgetary Control has submitted five other reports on discharge. I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent work. Ms Stauner's follow-up report on the 1998 discharge should be singled out in particular. We must carefully verify whether our demands from last year have been fulfilled by the Commission, in order to strengthen mutual confidence, openness and responsibility. Unfortunately, a number of points are still unresolved, especially the issue of a positive DAS, which I have already mentioned, as well as the issue of information for Parliament. It is this weakness, not least, which led to the recommendation by the rapporteur, Ms Rühle, that the discharge in respect of implementation of the European Development Funds be postponed – and quite rightly, in my view. Mr Folias' report is considered and coherent. It contains no proposed amendments. I should like to express my great appreciation of, and agreement with, the content of his report. The reports by Ms van der Laan and Mr Seppänen were approved and adopted by the Committee. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Bösch on his report – he has done a really excellent job. And his conclusion that there have not yet been any appreciable improvements in the fight against fraud also coincides with the OLAF Supervisory Committee's view. Furthermore, the Commission itself says several times in its own report that there were no significant changes in 1999 as compared with previous years, and that the total of unlawfully used funds in fact increased in some areas, for example in the Structural Funds. Let me emphasise once again that we are talking about taxpayers' money here. We must do our best to protect it. If we are to reach the zero-tolerance limit promised by the Commission, OLAF, the European Fraud Investigation Office established in 1999, must first and foremost be given greater independence. This involves recruiting its staff without interference from the Commission, for example. I support Mr Bösch's suggestion that the appointments committee should be chaired by an independent figure. And the Director himself must set out in advance a clearly structured programme of work. One thing that is clear is that we do not just want the old UCLAF to continue under the new name of OLAF. Unfortunately, an opportunity was missed in Nice to strengthen OLAF by creating a European Financial Public Prosecutor's Office and putting it under judicial control. Despite all Parliament's requests over the years and the commitment demonstrated by Commissioner Barnier and Commissioner Schreyer in particular, this subject was not even on the agenda at Nice. I therefore have some questions for the Commission now, as to whether, in accordance with Paragraphs 9 to 12 of the Bösch report, it will submit proposals by 1 June 2001 for what we might call a European Public Prosecutor's Office with restricted jurisdiction. I would also like put this question to the Commission: not all the Member States have yet ratified the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests and this is preventing it from entering into force. Could you please tell us which countries have not yet ratified it and what the Commission can do to remedy this intolerable situation? Another point: what is the Commission doing to overcome varying national interpretations of Community law on the recovery of own resources, as described in Paragraph 7(1) of its report? And lastly, there is the recovery of unduly paid funds, for which there are no figures in the Commission's report for 1999. Can the Commission tell me how much the Commission has claimed back and received as compared with the losses calculated, especially in the case of own resources in the EAGGF and in the Structural Funds?

Mr President, it is amazing that the follow-up report on the discharge seems to be generating far more interest this time than the discharge itself, which was, in fact, prepared by the previous Parliament. I welcome this with open arms, but there is nothing new in the fact that we have compiled such a report and are sticking to it, as we vowed to at the time. Yet I believe we have done justice to our task of verifying whether the Commission has met our demands in relation to the discharge. I am extremely pleased that the rapporteur has taken all these issues up again and would like to congratulate her to this effect. However, I am also delighted to be able to tell the Commission that it has fulfilled these demands extremely well. We are talking conditions, and not just comments. However, there are still a few matters to be resolved. This is also clearly brought out in the report, by the way. I would single out the closure of accounts for special mention in this respect. It is truly alarming when we put in excess of EUR 70 billion to one side, which inflates the budget and is then unavailable for other tasks that the EU has set itself. We must do more to tackle this than just compile a report once every two years; we need to cut back. Commissioner, this is a matter for you. Secondly, I do not think much to the idea of setting up a second office for internal investigations. We have set up OLAF and ought to concentrate far more on ensuring that OLAF is able to carry out its work properly and in an independent manner, particularly its internal investigations. I believe it is important for us to uphold the demand that we raised during the discharge process, namely that of creating a disciplinary chamber, which could be attached to the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice. I would remind the Commission not just to issue statements on this, but also produce a legal basis. Finally, I would like to say a big thank you for the efforts made in respect of the Gaza hospital. I was there myself. I am delighted that after all these years, it has at long last started work and is evidently serving the people well.

 Mr President, in its communication the Commission writes that the protection of the Communities' financial interests concerns us all, the bodies and their members at political level, the European and the national public service and their staff. But the need to guarantee equal, effective and deterrent protection throughout the European Union particularly affects the chief contributor, namely the European taxpayer. That is whom we represent here and to whom we are accountable. So I welcome the fact that the Commission document presents an overall strategy showing how it proposes to tackle the misuse of EU funds. However, I think the proposed period of five years, 2001 to 2005, is too long, for if we look back we will see that the issue of fighting fraud has been on the table for a long time now. A constantly growing budget has, unfortunately, also led to more irregularities and fraud. The single market has also opened the borders to fraudsters, while they remain closed for investigation and criminal prosecution. It is true that the regulations for the protection of the Communities' financial interests and on-the-spot checks were adopted, UCLAF was set up and then, one and a half years ago, OLAF was created, and articles on fighting fraud were enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and then in the Treaty of Amsterdam. These were all good measures, but they are not enough. The fraudsters are still one step ahead of us if not more. The enlargement of the Community and the introduction of the euro could bring further risks with them. That is why we must bring together police, administrative and criminal law resources and instruments, both between the Member States and with the EU. The Commission's four guidelines set out approaches that I find very welcome. First, an anti-fraud legislative policy. Here we must apply Article 280 of the Treaty of Amsterdam as the legal basis and develop it further, in order to bring the different national legislations under a common denominator and accordingly standardise penalties and procedures. The Commission intended to submit a document on this at the end of November. I have not received it so far. But above all, the legislation must be clearer, to prevent law-breakers from exploiting any loopholes. Secondly, a new culture of operational cooperation. It is important that all the Member States pull together. After all, more than 80% of the fraud in EU monies is carried out in these states. So far it has not been the case that they have joined forces, because otherwise they would all have ratified and therefore enforced the 1995 convention long since. Meanwhile parts of it have become out-dated and the Nice summit has not improved matters either. But the Commission also wants to create a new internal culture, as President Prodi promised. It is to be implemented through internal reform. We are keeping a watchful eye on this process. The third guideline is a supra-institutional approach to preventing and fighting corruption. What is at stake here is the credibility of the European bodies. That is a most important point, and here we must emphasise the importance of setting up OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, which is not so very new any more, and of its activities. We must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently, especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure. That is equally necessary for the Office and for the Commission. We propose appointing a hearing officer to give some protection to the rights of the accused. We call on the EIB and the ECB finally to accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement relating to OLAF. The system for fighting fraud must finally be perfected by enhancing the penal judicial dimension. We support the Commission's proposal to appoint a European Public Prosecutor as a first step towards creating a European judicial authority, given that this is something Parliament has long been calling for. This Public Prosecutor, assisted by Deputy Public Prosecutors in each Member State and supplemented by a judge in investigative procedures, in accordance with the 'Corpus Juris' expert report, would satisfy the principle of legal certainty and subsidiarity by acting as a kind of investigative and coordination office, without encroaching on the powers of the competent national courts. His remit must be limited strictly to the protection of financial interests; the rules and mechanisms governing his operation can then be regulated by reference to secondary legislation in the codecision procedure. I am aware that there are still many reservations about this. They need to be allayed, because it is only through constitutional and uniform regulations and measures, which the Nice summit did not, alas, produce, that we can tackle these kinds of crimes. I thank the Commission for its efforts and its work ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, like Mrs Malmström, I too would like to emphasise that transparency is the essential precondition for democratic control and participation of citizens in the decision-making process. Transparent procedures enable the administration to enjoy greater legitimacy and to be more effective and closer to the citizen. They also provide effective protection against the arbitrary use of and the abuse of power and against corruption. These are the considerations that led the Committee on Budgetary Control to deliver an opinion under this procedure. We are glad that the report repeats a crucial principle that we in the Committee on Budgetary Control also vehemently support. It is this: there can only be exceptions to the requirement of transparency in exceptional cases. That is why we cannot accept the long list of exceptions set out by the Commission. Here we are sending out the right signal to the citizens by radically cutting the list of these exceptions in our Amendment No 30, but, personally speaking, I find it most regrettable that we have only managed to simplify and clarify matters on this particular issue, however important it is, and not in the regulation as a whole. Unfortunately, the wish to anticipate any eventualities and to produce a regulation that is as complete and comprehensive as possible seems to have prevailed. Instead of a shorter text, we are therefore ending up with a longer one. I fear that will make it less legible or user-friendly. So it will become even more important for the citizen not to be left on his own with this regulation, but that each institution should establish contact points to which applicants can turn and where they can obtain practical assistance in their search for documents. If we really want to make it easier for the citizens to exercise their rights in practice, we will need specially trained staff in these contact points, who can, so to speak, take the citizen who is seeking information by the hand and guide him through the complex labyrinth of the institutions. The same applies to the use of languages. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Karlsson very sincerely for his presentation on the annual report. Mrs Schreyer's report was just as interesting. But I would particularly like to thank you, Mr Karlsson, as President of the Court of Auditors, for the way you have kept the Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control informed this time round. This has enabled us to prepare for today's debate without having to obtain details from the press. As you said, Mr Karlsson, 1999 was a dramatic year, with the resignation of the previous Commission and the appointment of the new one. We do not expect that the new Commission will immediately be able to rectify all the mistakes and irregularities that Parliament uncovered and because of which it called, in vain, for reforms at that time. Like the Court of Auditors, we welcome President Prodi's efforts to reform the Commission and we are following the implementation of these efforts in a constructive but not uncritical way. Are things finally changing for the better as regards the Community budget? We would have liked to have been able to say "yes" to that question, now that the new Commission has been in office for over a year and has, since September 1999, already been directly responsible for part of the process of implementing the 1999 budget. Unfortunately, we cannot yet answer with a clear conscience, even armed with the Court of Auditors' new annual report. The Court of Auditors has quite rightly noted the many steps that the new Commission has taken – or at least announced – in order to improve matters. Mrs Schreyer also mentioned this. I have in mind new procedures for setting priorities and allocating resources, changes in human resources policy, fundamental improvements in budget implementation and financial control, reform of programmes and the creation of an efficient audit service. But all these are still hopes for the future. The reality as described in the annual report is, however, more sobering. What is particularly regrettable and almost incomprehensible is that there are still problems about the reliability of accounting procedures. In other words, the Commission has not put its books in order, and the closures only reflect the true financial position subject to serious limitations. Information is missing on the payment of advances and the payment of instalments at the year end, and existing commitments are, believe it or not, undervalued by EUR 2.6 million. At the same time, the Court of Auditors says that potential claims have been significantly overvalued. Parliament expressly drew attention to these serious accounting errors during the discharge procedures for 1996, 1997 and 1998. Even if it is difficult and time consuming to fundamentally change budget management, we might have hoped, Commissioner, that the new Commission would at least manage to get the books straight without delay. But it is apparent that they have not even succeeded in doing that, which is a matter of great regret as far as I am concerned. When you assumed office, Mrs Schreyer, you assured us that you would strive to achieve this. The European Parliament now finds itself in an extremely difficult situation because earlier this year, in January, it declared that it could no longer accept a situation in which the 1999 closure was still marred by serious errors. You are familiar with the wording of that decision. But if there is no closure, that means that no discharge can be given for budgetary management, just as we said back in January. Closure is a condition for such a discharge. A solution needs to be found here, and I would like to ask you, Mrs Schreyer, if a correction of the 1999 accounts could be envisaged. Once again, and for the sixth successive time now, the Court is unable to give a positive statement of assurance, that is to say, it cannot give a guarantee of the legality and regularity of the procedures on which the financial statement is based. The number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given. The error rate is still well over 5%. Expressed in euros, that means that a sum of approximately EUR 5 billion was spent incorrectly. I most certainly recognise that fraud is not always involved, Mr Karlsson. It is often a case of carelessness or misunderstandings in the face of complicated rules and procedures, but there is no getting round it: an error rate this high is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated in the long run. I must refute your comments about poor implementation in the Member States, Mrs Schreyer, given that the Court of Auditors was quite clear about where the error rate lay within the Commission and, ultimately, it is still the Commission that bears responsibility for budget implementation. I would like to see more rigour here, so that we can really tell the European public that their money is being properly administered. We are now getting down to work in committee and will cooperate closely with you.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Mr van Hulten’s report was very broadly endorsed in the Committee on Budgetary Control. No doubt the same will happen during the vote here in plenary. So, my compliments to Mr van Hulten, but may I also ask the Commission to interpret this endorsement correctly. By it we are showing that we continue to support the reforms it has embarked on. We want these reforms. They must lead to greater transparency and efficiency in the handling of the taxpayers’ money and help improve the control systems. We need these reforms so that we can manage substantially to speed up the payments to the legitimate recipients of aid and at long last reduce the number of budgeting errors the Court of Auditors criticises every year. Setting up an independent – and I emphasise the word independent – audit service is a step in the right direction and responds to Parliament’s requests in its January resolution on the reform of the Commission. However, we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control. That is another thing this House decided in January and confirmed again in the 1998 discharge. Unlike the internal audit, the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made. These ex ante controls are essential because, unlike their national colleagues, the Commission officials have wide discretionary powers in many areas of financial decision-making. Independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors. If in future these audits are conducted decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk areas, we will also manage to prevent the controls from being too unwieldy. It is essential for the financial controllers to remain independent, which means they must not come under the same directors-general they are checking. In short, the controllers must not be under the orders of those whom they are checking! Parliament has repeatedly made that clear too. Unfortunately, we are still waiting in vain for a signal from the Commission in this respect. I would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps together with Parliament! That is in the Commission’s interest too.

 Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control unanimously supports the objectives of the EC Investment Partners programme. However, we do criticise the way in which it has been implemented. The first point to note is that the Commission is currently operating in a legal vacuum, because the proposal to continue the programme – which has after all already been extended twice – was only tabled at the end of January, that is, one month after the regulation had expired, and will not be able to be adopted until late autumn. We endorse the legislative proposal as a stopgap measure until the end of 2001, because we do not deny that, according to the figures published, 34 000 firms have been involved as partners, creating over 1 300 joint ventures and 42 000 jobs. Nevertheless, the Deloitte [amp] Touche appraisal report highlights a series of grave shortcomings which need to be tackled. For example, procedures have become increasingly bureaucratic and cumbersome and therefore less business- and user-friendly, which has resulted in the accumulation of a backlog of payments and increasing discontent among financial institutions and enterprises because of delays in decisions and contracts. Bad management and a lack of coordination between the ECIP Unit and the SCR also mar the Commission's reputation, as does the discrimination between financial institutions. For example, the state-owned development bank of Denmark receives 38% of funding while Spain's only receives 23%. As well as further points of criticism and three proposals for amendments, our opinion also contains questions which the Commission ought to take into account when it is deciding whether to continue operating the ECIP beyond 2001 or whether to incorporate it in a single investment facility, as Mr Dell'Alba has already mentioned.

 The fact of the matter is that yesterday evening, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I withdrew this explanatory statement. I asked the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control to draft a letter to that effect. Because we were sitting in the evening, that was no longer possible.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I regret the tone that has crept in here, even though we are discussing some very promising and highly detailed work. I would not wish to sink to the level that some of those present have opted for.   Parliament postponed the discharge for the 1998 financial year in April, but with no intention whatsoever of provoking a trial of strength with the Commission or even working towards a refusal of discharge. There was a need for further clarification, which would take time and effort, and it was always my aim, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, to complete the discharge process by the summer recess.   As these reports show, the past few weeks have been used to answer questions – albeit not all of them – and consequently, although our recommendation in respect of the outstanding discharges may not be unanimous, it is a positive one. I welcome with open arms the fact that the Commission is willing to work towards a reduction of errors in budgetary management, with a view to receiving a better statement of assurance as soon as possible. I detect a certain candour where the so-called old cases of suspected fraud are concerned. We have never held the new Commission responsible for these cases as such, but would still like to know that the right lessons have been drawn from the past through reappraisal, so that these cases do not come back to haunt us one day.   There is something I would like to ask you in this connection, Mrs Schreyer. When are the legislative proposals for a comprehensive legal and judicial area for the protection of the Union’s financial interests to be submitted? We agreed, on the basis of my report in January, that they were to be submitted by 30 June. It is 4 July today.   If there is one thing all those involved should be clear about where the impending grant of discharge is concerned, then it is this: We are not talking about a certificate of non-objection here. In future, the institution must be more willing to cooperate and provide the Committee on Budgetary Control with the information it needs to do its work, promptly and without evasion. If we build up confidence, reduce the amount of bureaucracy and exercise democracy openly – and this applies to so many areas – then I believe we will get back to being able to grant discharge on time each April.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is proposing a fundamental amendment to the directive on preventing money laundering. Since the 1991 directive was adopted many external factors have changed. Firstly, we have had experience with the existing directive and secondly, we need to take account of the changes in the Treaties. Given the growing awareness that money is the main objective and driving force behind organised crime, appropriate measures also need to be taken which target the profits from organised crime. The financial interests of the Community also fall victim to organised crime, as the reports about combating fraud in the Commission show. This is to the detriment of the budget of the European Communities. The Member States protect their financial interests in accordance with their laws, but the Communities do not have a police force or judicial authorities with which to bring defrauders before a judge so as to recover the lost money and impose punishments. That is why the Community budget needs to be protected by means of directives, regulations and other measures. Article 280 of the EC Treaty clearly states that, “The Community and the Member States shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community through measures to be taken in accordance with this Article, which shall act as a deterrent and be such as to afford effective protection…”. The Commission proposal should be seen in close connection with this article of the Treaty. Most of the crime which harms the Community budget is also organised crime. The rapporteur is right there. But there are also exceptions. Furthermore it is not always international organised crime, and here the Committee on Budgetary Control would have preferred the Commission proposal. However, we do recognise the delimitation problems and, if there is simply a reference to Article 280 of the Treaty, we are prepared to go along with the rapporteur. Incidentally, we believe that the money laundering directive is firstly about prevention and providing a deterrent and secondly about gathering evidence. The Member States need to have a legal base for their own and the Union’s sakes. All appropriate evidence ought to be used to punish fraud and other illegal activities which are to the detriment of the EU budget. It would certainly be in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the October 1999 European Council to proceed in this way. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the cooperation which we have enjoyed.

Mr President, I am somewhat surprised because this report was duly and unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I would have expected such matters to be clarified in committee, rather than here in plenary. The report has been available for some time and I therefore see no reason why we cannot debate and vote on it. Secondly, I would be obliged if Mr Dell'Alba could tell me what he means by saying that I have blocked documents for weeks. I fail to understand Mr Dell'Alba’s choice of words and assertion and I would welcome an explanation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
 published a survey which showed that an overwhelming majority of my fellow countrymen were in favour of a more common approach to judicial matters. No other area attracted nearly as much support for new initiatives at European level. Other surveys in the past have always confirmed that this applies both to Germans and to the citizens in most other Member States of the Union. We are therefore responding to the expectations of the people in tabling proposals on how to strengthen effectively the protection of the European Union against fraud. There are without doubt more pleasant topics of conversation than fraud and corruption, I grant you, but discussing them demonstrates clearly that we are not sweeping this tricky question under the carpet; on the contrary, we are setting ourselves this challenge, in precisely those cases which affect the institutions of the Union itself. This is why the Bösch report deserves particular attention and support. It was not adopted unanimously by the Committee on Budgetary Control for nothing, as I have already explained. Allow me to congratulate you on this report. It clearly illustrates that creating the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF is an important step, but is only a step on the path towards the European prosecutor which I have called for time and again both in a personal capacity and as rapporteur. A public prosecutor’s office to protect the interests of the Union against fraud would be the only really effective instrument to counteract the threat from organised crime. Organised crime has identified the institutions of the European Union as a particularly easy target. I am delighted that both the Commission and Parliament have included this question in the Intergovernmental Conference. The Committee on Budgetary Control has gone one step further in this report. We want an even more proactive approach and are therefore waiting for the Commission to present proposals for the first stage of a European public prosecutor’s office on the basis of the current Article 280 and I really do hope, Commissioner Schreyer, that you will revise your unfortunately somewhat wait-and-see attitude and accommodate us here. Mr President, allow me to refer to what was indeed said earlier but could not be answered. My question is to Mr Dell'Alba; could the honourable Member explain what I, as chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, allegedly blocked for weeks. I require an answer and I should like it recorded in the minutes.

 Madam President, Mr Barón Crespo, Chairman of the Socialist Group, also directed a comment to me. Last Monday we did indeed have a wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the admissibility of this question, and on whether, as chair of the committee, I should make use of Rule 161. Almost every member of the committee spoke on this. I myself have several times looked into the connection between the resolution, as it now appears in the compromise, and the explanatory statement, which reflects the rapporteur’s position and is her responsibility. I established the connection, and I said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh. Nevertheless, I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way, because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement. As I see it, there is a factual connection and I therefore decided not to reject this explanatory statement and informed the committee accordingly.

 Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to highlight two points that we included in the report. But firstly I would like to thank both rapporteurs for the enormous amount of work they have done. I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his open-mindedness, and I would like to thank Mr Vitorino for making a particular point that I would now like to address myself.  My first point concerns the discharge, which is very topical at the moment. The EU Treaty states quite clearly that the European Parliament grants the Commission discharge to implement the budget. In practice, however, this act on our part is twofold, the first stage being to undertake a political assessment under the discharge procedure, and the second being to close the budgetary accounts. Now the first stage, that of the political evaluation, can have mixed results. There is assent, there is refusal, and matters are sometimes deferred. This does not necessarily affect the budgetary accounts, the second stage that is, for they can be closed even if the first stage met with refusal. This has the advantage that a balance from the budgetary accounts can then be carried forward to the following year. This should be enshrined in the Treaty, for it is already included in our Rules of Procedure and is, as I said, established practice. In addition, we would like to receive information directly from the Member States, so as to improve the way in which we conduct our assessment of budgetary management.   My second point relates to the creation of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. For years we have endeavoured to protect the financial interests of the Community more effectively. This now also needs to be done under criminal law, at European level, in very open and clear cooperation with the Member States. In other words, there is not enough police and judicial cooperation between the Member States in the face of increasing cross-border crime that is harmful to the EU budget. That is why we need coordination at European level, without prejudicing the right of national courts to administer justice. I am most grateful that some Member States, but particularly the Commission, have been so willing to take up this theme.

Mr President, I should just like to say in reply to Mr van den Berg that the report on postponing discharge for the Structural Funds is ready and the vote will be taken on the premise that this is indeed merely a postponement and does not grant or refuse discharge and that everything which we worked on together yesterday will be taken into account in the final version, i.e. that we shall nonetheless debate and vote on Mrs Rühle’s report.
Theato (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, fellow Members, Mrs Schreyer, Mr Fischler, I should like to make one thing clear from the outset: postponing a discharge is not tantamount to refusing a discharge, irrespective of what is always wrongly assumed. On the other hand, granting discharge is a serious procedure with serious consequences in that the controlling body answers for the fact that the activities and financial conduct of the body being controlled have been correct from a legal, economic and political point of view. This responsibility on the part of Parliament vis-à-vis European citizens and taxpayers is a heavy burden, which is why discharge for the Commission’s management of the budget cannot be reduced to a compulsory, but somewhat tiresome annual exercise and I am sorry that the President of the Commission could not be here today. On the contrary, what is needed is a thorough examination on the basis of pertinent sources of information and a conscientious appraisal of the results. And that is what we have done in the Committee on Budgetary Control over recent weeks. The rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, and the draftsmen of the opinions of the other discharge reports and working documents, whom I should like to congratulate on their work, have based their work first and foremost on the annual and special reports of the Court of Auditors and on the Commission’s replies. The sources for the information and documents needed from the Commission, on the other hand, gushed little, if anything at all, despite a great deal of paper and, unfortunately, no clear answers were given to the questions asked. When the Commission then writes to complain about the questionnaires and working papers of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, that shows that something has gone wrong with the flow of information between the controlling and the controlled parties and this must be rectified as quickly as possible. We are working on that. Mrs Schreyer also mentioned it. However, I am warning you that the Commission is heading straight for the same fate as its predecessor. According to Article 276 of the Treaty, Parliament, and hence the Committee appointed by it, is entitled to any information or documents which it needs or demands in order to prepare its discharge. This includes reappraising old cases. The rapporteur quotes four cases by way of example. Other cases should be on the list, but the Commission has unfortunately not yet passed them on, despite the date of March 2000 set in the 1997 discharge. Here too the Commission misunderstands our basic cause for concern. The rapporteur and the Committee on Budgetary Control are not holding the present Commission per se responsible for the deplorable state of affairs in previous years. The resignation of the previous Commission did not put an end to it. On the contrary, the new Commission was completely aware of all the outstanding accusations before it entered office and it undertook to assume responsibility and establish transparency. I take this to mean that it must clear up all the old cases without exception and – where necessary – must pass them to the courts. Cover-ups or even sweeping issues under the carpet are not the answer. On the contrary, the answer means being prepared to draw conclusions from the unhappy events of the past, so that the same thing does not happen again in the future. This ranges from precise filing rules, so that documents cannot simply disappear, to a fundamental reform of disciplinary proceedings and much else besides. This approach also informs the White Paper on the reform of the Commission tabled by Mr Kinnock. Mrs Stauner’s report lists our short-term demands with respect to these conclusions and we all consider that they can be met by the stated deadline. The Committee debated them at several meetings and finally adopted them with one vote against. Here we must thank the rapporteur for her honesty, on the one hand, and for her perfect readiness to compromise, on the other. One of the most important objectives that we consider the Commission should achieve is to reduce the error rate in payments to well below the persistent figure of 5%. I know, Mrs Schreyer, that you have tabled an action plan. Nonetheless, the error rate has remained at the same high level for the last five years. We shall have to debate this. However, we also know that most errors occur in the Member States and we are prepared, as a committee, to discuss this with you. Nonetheless, we take the view and the Treaty states that the Commission is responsible for implementing the overall budget. Excuses and promises are no use. We need clear proof of improvement. On balance, my conclusion is that we need a strong Commission, which is able to act, which works openly together with Parliament and which supplies Parliament with all the information needed or requested. Using the pressure of postponement to advance discharge is constructive pressure because it gives the Commission the chance to clear up shortcomings caused by slowness, pettifogging or unwillingness so that Parliament will be able to grant discharge for 1998 as quickly as possible, hopefully before the summer recess. I think that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, should direct his team forcefully here in order to take transparency in Europe a stage further.

Mr President, it says “BUDG 1998 discharge” on the notice board, but it should say CONT. Perhaps this could be corrected because Budgets and Budgetary Control are always getting confused. It is the question of control which is at issue here.

 Madam President, I would like to thank President Prodi for his clear exposition of the reform objectives. We have made it clear in the course of the debates that we have been having in the past few weeks, in particular with Commissioner Kinnock – and in saying this I am taking up what Mr Cox said – that we cannot endorse the wholesale scrapping of independent financial control. Decentralisation, yes, but we certainly require independent financial control, i.e. a unit in the individual Directorates-General which are, however, directly subordinate to the Financial Controller. To do otherwise would be to make one and the same body responsible for authorisation and financial control.   We have spelt this out again and again, and also made it very clear in Mr Van Hulten’s report of 19 January, in paragraphs 10 and 11 to be precise. Now so far I have not had sight of the White Paper and I would like to ask you Mr Kinnock: does it reflect our position? I have a question concerning ex-ante control, which is still to be carried out where necessary, and on an independent basis at that. I understood Mr Prodi to say – or I believe I understood him to say – that this ex-ante control will not take place as a matter of course, but neither will it be scrapped wholesale either, and the independence of financial control will be preserved. Is this reflected in the White Paper? I will read it with a great deal of interest and very attentively, but perhaps you could give me an idea now as to how these matters have been dealt with in the White Paper.   The question of transitional periods is worrying us. The expression “soft law” has been bandied about but there is no such thing. There is neither soft nor hard law. There is only law, and no transitional period should be written into this reform, since this would lead to legal uncertainty.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the term of office of eight members of the European Court of Auditors will expire at the beginning of next year. I am sorry that the Finnish Presidency of the Council is now leaving us because the Finns also wish to reappoint their present member of the Court of Auditors. Under Article 247 paragraph 3 of the Treaty founding the European Community and other similar provisions in the ECSC and EURATOM treaties, Parliament must give its opinion on the candidates before the Council unanimously appoints or reappoints the members of the Court of Auditors for a period of six years. The Council asked Parliament to give its opinion in a letter dated 3 November 1999, which also contained the names and curricula vitae of the candidates. The candidates for new appointments were Mr Reynders from Belgium, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn from Ireland, Mr Caldeira from Portugal and Mr Fabra Vallés from Spain and the candidates for reappointment were Mr Mohr from Denmark, Mr Salmi from Finland, Mr Clemente from Italy and Mr Karlsson from Sweden, in alphabetical order of the proposing countries. As required under Article 35 of our Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Budgetary Control interviewed and questioned the proposed candidates individually on 22 and 23 November 1999 on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty which require that candidates must hold or have held or be particularly suitable for an auditing office. Impartiality is the most important requirement. We also based our deliberations and appraisals on the guidelines in the 1992 and 1995 parliamentary resolutions by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Bourlanges. As a result, I am in a position to inform you that, having conducted a detailed examination, the Committee on Budgetary Control has come to the conclusion that the candidates meet the criteria for high office at the Court of Auditors and has returned a positive opinion on all eight candidates. We particularly welcome the fact that, if Parliament gives its assent, the 15 members of the Court of Auditors will include two women. I recall that our condition at the last appointment was that at least one of the candidates for appointment should be a woman and that Parliament would not otherwise give its assent to the appointments. We had one woman then, and another has now joined her. I think we are making good progress. If plenary votes as scheduled, i.e. on Thursday, we in Parliament will have fulfilled our duty to state our opinion on time, thereby allowing a smooth changeover in the composition of the Court and ensuring that the necessary collaboration with it continues. These are the conditions which govern the procedure. But, looking to the future, there is more to it than that for Parliament. On Monday we discussed the Court of Auditors’ report for 1998. It highlighted a number of very important tasks which we must now tackle. I refer mainly to the fact that the Court states quite clearly in its report, and I can only emphasise this, that we must change the spending culture. The Court of Auditors gave some very important indicators here. Having discussed the Budget 2000 in great detail in Parliament and paved the way so that in crisis areas, such as the Balkans, there is multiannual planning of funding, we must now gear ourselves to that perspective, instead of frittering money away on small, individual programmes and projects, which are not conducive to efficient control and where more is spent on staffing than on the objectives to be achieved. What we want is to work in a target-orientated and not an expenditure-orientated manner. I therefore readily agree with the Court of Auditors: we need better financial management. Some of the Commission’s proposals as to how this should be done have now been tabled and Parliament must also give a detailed opinion on them. We can no longer afford for large swathes of the people in the European Union to say no to Europe. We must all work on this; we must listen to what the Court of Auditors has to say and include it in our appraisals so that we again hear a positive response from the people of Europe to what it is that joins us together.

 Mr President, I should first like to thank President Karlsson for introducing the 1998 Annual Report. We Members of the European Parliament have now been able to take an initial look at the report, which is almost 500 pages long, after having been alarmed by premature press reports. Not knowing the content of the Court of Auditors' report, we were unable either to confirm or to deny these reports. The issue of the Court of Auditors providing Parliament with information in good time is one which the two institutions need to resolve as a matter of urgency. President Karlsson, I am sure that you agree with this request and that for your part you will see to it that Parliament – in its capacity as the people's representative and as the control authority – is given information first, before the results of the Court's audit reach the press. I also refer to the report of my colleague, Mr Wynn, which the European Parliament adopted in spring 1998. Since then, I hear that the Court has identified the office in its house from which the report – and possibly also the confidential preliminary report – was clearly leaked. There has also been a suspension. In this case, the pressure exerted by the European Parliament to find out where the leaks had occurred has led to success. The audit report on the table will not only provide us with a basis for our forthcoming work on the 1998 discharge; it will also serve as an important document for reforming the administrative structures in the Commission and will be used constructively to bring about the necessary improvements. We now have the opportunity in this Parliament to monitor this significant process of reform in the Commission constructively, but critically. Once again, the Court criticises the unacceptably high incidence of errors in budgetary management in 1998. It refuses to confirm the legality and regularity of the Commission's accounts and thus – for the fifth time in succession – does not give its statement of assurance. This is very serious. On examining the report, it is striking that once again cases of mismanagement, irregularities and fraud are described, and that they occur in nearly all of the areas investigated, on both the revenue and expenditure sides. Every year evasion of duties and VAT payments causes significant losses to the Community budget. There are serious shortcomings in the Member States' management and control systems here. We ask, when does the Commission finally intend to remind the Member States of their duty? And, do the Member States not realise that by allowing funds to decline, they are cutting off their nose to spite their face? In the agricultural sector, the situation remains disturbing. Overall, it is here that the most serious cases of incorrect utilisation of funds are found. Here too, the Court refers to the Member States' carelessness. In the important sector of research and development, mismanagement and a lack of transparency associated with advance payments and the final account caused losses. Over 50% of payments are said to be incorrect, with around two thirds even containing serious errors. The same applies to the Structural Funds. Let us get down to work, together with the Court of Auditors and the Commission. In the on-going enlargement process this is absolutely essential! (Applause)

 Mr President, I have a point to make on the same subject. Time was obviously in short supply, yet the agenda went out on time and we knew how things were to proceed. I deeply regret that this happened and that the impression has now been given that Parliament was not prepared to accept the report. I would urge that we take up contact with the Court and arrange things in such a way that there is enough time for the Court’s report at the next part-session in Strasbourg. However, we also need to ensure that the President can attend and present his report. It is not acceptable for us to be forever postponing this. I would not wish there to be a major interinstitutional fall-out over this. It is quite usual for us to receive this report at the end of the year, normally in November. This could have been done in this part-session. It is a matter of deep regret to me that it could not be so.

 Mr President, with the report of my colleagues, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, Parliament is delivering a first opinion on the tasks of the next Intergovernmental Conference. Without going into all the details, the framework has now been outlined for the challenge which the Europe of the near future has to meet if it is to be better understood and accepted by its citizens.  The biggest challenge is undoubtedly presented by the enlargement of the Union, which is something we affirm and want to see. This enlargement to include more than 20 Member States – perhaps 30 in a number of years’ time – could lead to a strengthening of the Union but also, instead, to its weakening; to its strengthening because Europe is reinforcing its identity on the basis of its political and cultural history. At the same time, however, such an increase in the number of actors on the European stage would throw up institutional problems and produce considerable operational weaknesses if relevant measures and radical reforms of the present system were not implemented in good time before enlargement.  The danger of crippling the decision-making ability of the legislature – of the Council and Parliament – as well as of making the Commission unable to translate the laws into effect is a significant problem. A further problem lies in the difficulty of knowing how the Treaties are to be adapted to the ever more rapid development of Community realities. The two rapporteurs have quite correctly set out these problems and linked them to specific areas of policy.  By means of the opinion it has delivered, the Committee on Budgetary Control wishes to answer the question of whether a further development of supervision, together with effective protection of Community finances, should be approached through the creation of a European public prosecution service, established on the basis of corpus juris but according to the spirit of subsidiarity, as also explained and clarified for us last week by Commissioner Barnier at the part-session in Brussels. Overall, the draft presented here points in the right direction, and I should like to acknowledge my gratitude to both rapporteurs.

 Mr President, the very first thing I would like to do is thank the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, very much indeed for this report on the Commission‘s fifth supplementary and amending budget, and make it known that it meets with our approval. You may find it astonishing that a fifth supplementary and amending budget is being put forward here, at the end of this financial year. I would like to remind you though that Parliament, or rather the European Union as a whole, have, in recent years, developed the Notenboom procedure to such an extent that the carry-overs were practically indecipherable by the end of the year, and that we pressed for doing this by means of supplementary and amending budgets, in order to achieve greater transparency. And look what is happening: the number is rising all the time. I think though, that this has enabled us to bring about greater openness and also a situation that lends itself more readily to scrutiny.  It will not surprise you to learn that I am particularly keen to talk about OLAF and the fifteen additional posts. OLAF, which came into operation on 1 July this year, thereby disbanding UCLAF, the previous anti-fraud office, is a new body and we want to do everything we can to make it run efficiently. I assume that this is something that is a major matter of concern for the Commission every bit as much as it is for the other institutions, which are at present still engaged in deciding on accession via the interinstitutional agreement. Originally, amending budget 4/1999 provided for 15 posts for OLAF, which was to have a total of 300 posts. A total of 120 posts that were part of what used to be UCLAF – I will refer to them as posts rather than people – are already at the disposal of OLAF and we must now consolidate this position with all haste. That is why we were most disappointed that people took so much convincing when it came to adding a further fifteen posts to the fifteen provided for in the supplementary and amending budget 4/1999, i.e. a total of 30 for this year. I am very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for giving its unequivocal support to the Committee on Budgetary Control in this matter and that we now have these 30 posts for 1999. The budget has earmarked 75 posts for the year 2000. But the full staffing plan really ought to guarantee that OLAF is fully up and running by 2001 at the latest. Mrs Schreyer, I would like to put a few direct questions to you. I believe you have been in touch with the monitoring committee, for which provision has specifically been made to reinforce its secretariat with high-flying personnel. This monitoring committee, which is part of OLAF, comprises five independent experts who continue to pursue their normal occupations however. They may not be undertaking this work on a voluntary basis – they receive a certain amount of money to cover costs, but this is not payment in the real sense – and they require appropriate support. You will have had contact with the monitoring committee by now and in so doing also have allowed yourself to be persuaded that this work is necessary to guarantee the independence of OLAF. Yesterday, we decided on the procedure for appointing the director of OLAF in the Committee on Budgetary Control. I would like to ask you the following question Mrs Schreyer: on 28 October, I wrote to you to ask if you, indeed the Commission as a whole, could send me official confirmation of the list of eleven candidates for this office. I am sorry to say that so far I have not received a reply to this letter. I would like to take the opportunity in this plenary sitting to urge you most fervently to provide a response as soon as possible. As soon as possible means that I am counting on it being this week – and I want to make that very plain – so that we can get the official referral under way, so as to enable us to make progress here in Parliament. The Council is putting pressure on, as is Parliament. And so should the Commission, so that there is still time for us to appoint the director before the end of this year. I would urge you, if you are able, to undertake to have the official referral together with the list of eleven candidates, forwarded to us straightaway.
Theato (PPE-DE

 Mr President, I have a specific question: Mrs Schreyer, you said that the list will be made available to us before the end of today. Which list is that? The list of eleven or a list of four? Mr Bösch explained it in great detail. I would like to warn of the fact that we are not pursuing the procedures properly. They are clearly set out in Regulation 1037/1999 and in the interinstitutional agreement. Parliament is not in a position to say “we will hear eleven“, or if there is another list, “we will hear four”! That is not how it works! We cannot afford to open up the possibility of those who were placed on the list by the monitoring committee taking legal action. First of all you must reach agreement with the monitoring committee and then you must officially pass the list on to us so that we can then set our own procedure in train, come to an agreement with the Council and then make a proposal to you as regards who to appoint. Ultimately therefore, you appoint in name only, but the procedure leading up to this must be conducted properly. Could you please tell us exactly which list it is you intend to make available to us today?

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to give my heartfelt thanks to Mr Napolitano for his fine report and for the way he exhorted us to keep making strides forward. I am also reminded of a past event. On 7 October 1998, so a good year ago, there was an overwhelming two-thirds majority here in Strasbourg for Mr Bösch’s report on OLAF and thus for the establishment of an operationally independent anti-fraud office. In view of the reproaches that were already being made in the Chamber at the time, we had asked that OLAF be an investigative body that should be able to pursue cases of fraud or corruption objectively and without reservations. The first draft from the Commission of the time was unusable. We pressed for changes. Then, in May of this year, together with the Council, we adopted the Regulation on OLAF and the three of us, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, reached a decision on the interinstitutional agreement that we are discussing today.  This agreement, if you like, opens the door for OLAF. It sets out the obligations and rights of those affected by investigations. Through this, we are giving, amongst other things, a clear response to the much-discussed ‘whistle-blower’ question. Any official who has concrete grounds for believing that he is dealing with a case of fraud or corruption will, in the future, not only be obliged to pass this on but will also have the right – bypassing their superior if need be – to go directly to OLAF if they feel this to be necessary. The official should not be disadvantaged in any way as a result of taking this action.  There is another important point in this regard which has been a grey area in the past. This concerns the information given to those affected by an investigation. This information must, in the future, be provided as quickly as possible. In no case must Members of this Parliament, officials or employees be singled out in conclusions by name, without the person concerned having been given the opportunity to state their case. With this we have clearly established the contradictory principle. Any exceptions to this will only be possible with the agreement of the President or the Secretary-General and only then in strictly circumscribed individual cases concerning particularly complex investigations and in which providing the individuals concerned with information at too early a stage could endanger the work of national judicial authorities.  These are the two main components of the interinstitutional agreement. They were approved on 6 May 1999 here in Strasbourg with a large majority. The political decisions that were made at that time must now be firmly and formally established in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure so that they can become legally effective. I know from conversations that I have had that some colleagues are concerned, and this concern has been expressed here too, that investigations by OLAF could be misused in order to put pressure on them, even though they are very well aware that it is a matter of our credibility that we as MEPs should not exclude ourselves from such investigations.  There are two different aspects to this. Firstly, through OLAF, the Protocol on privileges and immunities which gives this Parliament and its work special protection, will not be abrogated. Therefore it will still be the case that it will be up to national judicial authorities to apply for immunity to be revoked should the need arise, following which this House will then have to take its own decision on the matter. Secondly, we have taken all conceivable precautions to ensure the independence of this office in its investigative work, even though it is officially, and organisationally, a department of the Commission. As the body of political control, we shall intervene if this independence is infringed. This is why I must take this opportunity to advise the Commission that I do not find the recent appointment of a new divisional head for OLAF acceptable. This is not a criticism of the person concerned, whom I do not even know, but a criticism of the fact that rapid attempts are obviously still being made here to pre-empt matters before the new director arrives. This situation must be reversed.  (Applause)
 The new Commission must be careful to ensure that in this regard too, there is not the slightest hint of suspicion either.  A brief word on the appointment procedure for the new director, as there has been some confusion. After the Commission draws up the definitive list of suitable candidates, it becomes a political matter for Parliament and the Council to reach agreement between themselves on the best candidates. I refer to what Mr Bonde so rightly said: the new director faces a huge challenge which will require a high degree of experience, independence and the ability to assert oneself. We are involved then in a very important decision-making procedure. Let us make good use of it.  (Applause)

 Mr President, Professor Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of the 19 hearings of the future Commissioners, we continually heard talk of the fine-sounding concepts of transparency, efficiency, responsibility and accountability. Not piecemeal improvements, but root and branch reform is to be carried out, as you plausibly inform us Mr Prodi. That is a difficult task for Mr Kinnock, however, because words are not enough. Deeds must quickly follow, and in a way which is fully open to scrutiny by Parliament. For us, constructive co-operation with the Commission is a prerequisite for achieving a sustained improvement in the regrettable image our citizens unfortunately have at present of Europe.  Specifically, I should like to touch upon three points relating to budgetary supervision. Firstly, it is normal practice to separate the power to spend and the responsibility for supervising spending. You, Professor Prodi, have combined both areas in the one department. What is your view on possibly separating the two areas, either now or in the future? As matters stand, don’t you fear conflicts of interest? Secondly, I was pleased at what you said about keeping the public informed. I also wish to see openness of this kind in relation to our Committee, especially within the framework of the discharge procedure where we are entitled to expect the information we require from the Commission to be of a particular quality. In future, we do not want initially to have to find out from the press when there have been difficulties, poor management and so on. The third point concerns OLAF, the new office for combating fraud. This year’s staffing of the office is quite inadequate. Unfortunately, Mrs Schreyer has not expressed a clear opinion about the possibility of a further 15 posts this year, giving a total of 30. From the answers at yesterday’s meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control, there was no evidence of any change to the, so far, secretive attitude of the Commission and its administration.  There is still a lot to be done here in the services. This also applies to work on the 30 cases on the UCLAF-OLAF list which have still to be cleared up, not to mention the 900 other cases. I am counting on the fact that some life is going to be breathed into the words “transparency”, “efficiency”, “responsibility” and “accountability”.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have impatiently awaited the second report from the Wise Men and I cannot conceal the fact that I would have preferred to have had it before the hearings of the Commission candidates were held rather than afterwards. But we do now have it and it was announced that it would not be a continuation of the first report and would therefore not contain any new revelations. Rather the report is providing us with a yardstick for the reform of the European Commission, which the future President, Romano Prodi, has announced, and which has just been confirmed again in some detail by Mr Kinnock. The report also makes it clear how necessary a far-reaching wholesale reorganisation and rearrangement is and that it is not enough to carry out only selective modifications. Even where the subject of this second draft of the Wise Men talks in somewhat theoretical terms of “cultural practices and Commission procedures”, the question of the improved utilisation, supervision and thereby protection of Community finances runs like a red thread through the thoroughly analysed areas. Recommendations are included, which Parliament, for the most part, has already stipulated as requirements for the previous Commission. Will they now be adhered to? Mr Kinnock, we will have to take you at your word. I am thinking in this regard of the question of the Financial Regulation and its adaptation, efficient controls, independence of financial control, the significance of discharge and, above all, the question of clear definitions of tasks and responsibility for the individual departments, officials and Commissioners. A clear reference to ethical responsibility will be a pointer to a new culture that does not just stop at the Secretary-General, the Cabinets and the Commissioners. If the Code of Conduct for the Commission is described as being insufficient and the Wise Men call for a stricter code for the administration, if the disciplinary process is reformed and sanctions brought about, then in this way our demands will also be taken up, the fulfilment of which we will have to keep an eye on. As far as the complex matter of combating fraud is concerned, the call of the five Wise Men for a European Prosecution Office raised eyebrows and rightly so. The significance of this point is not impaired by the fact that the Wise Men were not the first to call for this. I am casting my mind back to the reports of my colleagues, Fabra Vallés and Bösch, as well as my own report concerning criminal prosecution to protect the financial interests of the Union. This key question must be resolved if we want to successfully defend ourselves against fraud and corruption, which is to the detriment of European contributors. The goal, which the Wise Men have set, the creation of a European Prosecution Office within a year, is ambitious, yet it is completely feasible if the will is there. With close cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, within three months we have succeeded in establishing the new, independent anti-fraud office OLAF. Now the next step must be taken. Here as well, the new Commission will have to be measured in terms of their willingness for reform, as demanded by the public and Parliament. Although the reports of the five Wise Men have been regarded as being helpful, in future Parliament should again assume responsibility for supervisory functions and not pass this responsibility on to outside parties. We do want a strong Commission but we also want a strong Parliament. In any case, the second report of the Wise Men still has to be prepared for the plenum by the competent committee, and for this we require all the documentation and information which the Wise Men had access to. On this matter I would like to put another question to Mr Kinnock, a question which was not answered in the hearings: will the Committee on Budgetary Control also have access to the same documentation and information made available to the Wise Men? I believe that we can then work together towards a sound future for the European Union.

 Mr President, I would have been quite happy to applaud Mr Rocard had it not been for the unfortunate fact that not everything he said was in line with what I am going to say. That is why I could not give him the applause I would have liked to give. The fact is that I cannot act without thinking; I have to be guided by the facts. The Capital of Culture that we are discussing today is something like a beacon of light in the small amount of cultural policy that we are allowed to deal with, so I am happy that we are carrying the torch onwards. The idea has been around for a long time now; it originated with a Greek lady Member of this House, and I think we can take pride in it. I also agree with Mr Rocard’s demand that the choice should be of at least two cities. It was after all we who introduced this idea, and I think, Commissioner, that it can be put into practice right now. In this Capital of Culture, European diversity ought to be much more visible than it has been up to now, and so I do not think that these amendments run counter to what the Commissioner wants to do. I therefore ask her to consider whether she cannot perhaps incorporate this. Secondly, I have to reiterate how much we all regret the Council of Ministers’ decision, none more than I, as I, back in 1999, was furiously angry about the Council of Ministers’ decision, seeing it as short-sighted and guided by national considerations. At the time, the Council of Ministers knew as well as we did that the European Union was going to be enlarged, and it showed that it did not give a damn about it, by naming only Western European cities right up to 2019. That is to the Council’s shame and not to our own, for we were bound by their decision. The decision has been made, though, and, as they say where I come from, pacta sunt servanda
! That is why we cannot change the fact that, up to 2019, the countries in question will also be entitled to propose cities. That is why, for the benefit of my German audience, I would like to say that Germany will be able to propose a city for 2010. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, though, endorse the Commissioner’s proposal for two Capitals of Culture, simply because the 10 new Member States cannot do anything about the shameless conduct of the old 15. It is now for the Commissioner to remedy that; she can do so by giving two cities the opportunity to present themselves to the world, and I do not believe it is so terrible that we should be doing this, if, for example, in 2010, we have one city from Germany and another from Hungary. I do not see that as such a bad idea. The two countries have marvellous things in common and the rivalries between them have been productive. Let me say one thing more: we may be 25 countries strong today, but there will be even more by 2019 – Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, not to mention the others. If we are allowed to name only one Capital of Culture, that means that each country would have a turn only once in a generation, and we cannot expect the public to put up with that. It is for that reason that I, like my group, support the Commissioner’s proposal.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the run-up to an election and I, just like Mrs Weiler, am grateful that right at the end of this parliamentary term we have managed to create something for many young people, indeed for all young people. This is because the Europass is something that really affects young people, even those who are entering their studies. I think we have spent a long time looking for this, and I am glad that the Commissioner can get it moving at the end of her current period in office. It would, of course, have been nice to pass this in the present legislative period, but we have to accept what cannot be done, and, if we manage to do this in September or October, that will not be too bad. Although we should not overload the Europass with expectations of absolutely everything, we should at least expect it to make realities of those constant pious truisms, transparency and mobility opportunities. These are the stuff of daily life for young people and workers; they are often affected by European laws and still cannot evolve as we would wish. This means that there is a need for clear decisions on the European career structure. We must say very clearly what is meant by the specialist competences of the individual. It must be possible to include the language competence of individuals in a tested form. We should also, as you have suggested, take into account young people’s voluntary service, for that is a competence acquired by a young person in the course of his or her life, and it should be more recognised than it has been so far, including by employers. I also believe that there are very many opportunities to help young people to find their way in this huge labour market and in turn to be found on the basis of their qualifications. It is often, today, impossible to assess exactly what a person can do, simply because what his references say is not translated and basically cannot be compared. So I believe that in this Europass we have achieved clarity about training periods, the content of training and professional competence, and I believe that that is what we need, what young people need, in order to really experience Europe for themselves. So let me say once again that my group is grateful that Mrs Zissener has taken on this report and we are delighted that in the autumn we will be able to get this matter going together – unfortunately with a new Presidency of the Council – in the interests of our young people and therefore in the interests of our children and grandchildren.

 Mr President, first of all, I would like to say how delighted I am that this day has arrived. As Chairwoman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South-East Europe, and on behalf of all those who have no opportunity to speak today, I would like to express my warm thanks to the two Commissioners. I think we should all be more than satisfied by Mr Patten's and Mr Verheugen's statements, including the factual information they have supplied. They have amply justified why Croatia can now be granted accession candidate status. My question is this, and it has already been asked several times: what opportunities do the Commission and, indeed, this Parliament have to persuade the Council that it should grant this candidate status swiftly so that negotiations can be opened soon? I endorse the points made by Mr Lagendijk. Can we do anything to prevent the failure so far to sign the Stability Pact from being viewed as an impediment to the opening of negotiations? This is an important issue, and we would very much appreciate a response from one of the Commissioners. Once again, my warmest thanks and my congratulations on today's momentous decision.

 Mr President, one year ago Croatia applied for membership of the European Union with the support of all its political parties. We should remember that Croatia could have been joining with Slovenia on 1 May were it not for the terrible years of war that it, and its neighbour Bosnia-Herzegovina endured, and the four years of Serbian occupation of one third of its territory, which resulted in the independent young democracy taking many wrong turns. In the last five years, Croatia has made a clear decision for Europe and created the conditions for joining. I can tell the Commissioner that it has good relations with its neighbours and regional cooperation is working. The modernisation of its economy is under way and the economic data give cause for optimism. I agree with you that judicial reform is lagging behind. Administrative capacities could also be improved. Everything cannot be done in a day, however. Croatia is on the right road and is determined to pursue that road single-mindedly. The new government’s objectives include the return of refugees and/or the return of property. This year has already seen these ambitious objectives embodied in an agreement between the government and the Serb minority. It would be nice if the European Union could at last prevail upon the Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina to take back Croatian refugees from Croatia. That would make housing available for the Serbs who want to return. The lack of employment opportunities, especially in the parts of Croatia where the Serbs used to live, is a major obstacle to their return and I hope that the CARDS programme will be able to assist here, too. Croatia is cooperating well with The Hague, to which, last year, the Croatian Government even opened its archives. Last year, too, three Croats accused of war crimes were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment in Croatia itself. Three weeks ago, two re-indicted generals went to The Hague voluntarily. Europe should not judge Croatia’s cooperation with the International Court only by the case of Ante Gotovina, who is a member of the French foreign legion, is said to have a French passport, and may be lying in the sun in Cannes or Corsica, or may well be anywhere. He is not in Croatia, otherwise he would already have been captured. To hold Croatia hostage to the Gotovina case is unjust and fails to do justice to the progress it has undeniably made. The Baltas report also mentions the problems concerning the border between Croatia and Slovenia. I believe these problems are close to being resolved. I would just like to make one comment about the unilateral announcement of the fisheries protection zone in the Adriatic. That was foolish. It was perfectly legal, but I think the new government is right in now seeking to put it on a sounder footing in regional cooperation with Slovenia and Italy. The Commission’s treatment and assessment of Croatia’s progress will send a signal to the entire region. Every politician I have met in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Serbia is keenly awaiting the outcome. They will then be able to see whether the tremendous efforts we are demanding of them for their nations will be really worthwhile.

 Mr President, Commissioner, if I am honest, the situation in Kosovo makes me feel both sad and helpless. In 1999, we went to war to stop the expulsion and repression of the Albanians in Kosovo. I was in favour of that; after all, I had visited the country and its people since 1990 and had experienced terrible things, including torture, experienced the apartheid regime for myself. I naively believed that everything would then improve. I could not imagine that the same Albanians who had suffered all that would now do the same wrongs to their fellow human beings of other nationalities – Serbs, Roma, Ashkali. They did, in the end with obviously planned and criminal acts of violence. Many people died or became refugees and cultural heritage was desecrated. What is more, they then attacked hospitals and schools, which we had probably helped to pay for, KFOR and UNMIK. It is clear who was behind it. I believe the ordinary Albanian people know, too. The Albanian leadership’s protest and distancing of itself was not loud enough or convincing enough for me. This terrible act of violence has set Kosovo back a long way. Is that how it wants to join the EU, as Mr Patten said? The criminals there do not want to join the EU; they do not want to live together in a civilised manner. They want strife because strife gives them scope for corruption and crime. Everything is now in ruins. I do not believe that the international community has pressed hard enough for those Serbs who want to return to do so; it has not provided all the necessary accompanying measures. I would not want to return to an enclave either, neither would I want always to have to be protected by KFOR. That is why not enough has been done here. We need to think about that. The government in Belgrade has deliberately prevented the local Serbs from being actively involved in shaping Kosovo. It has established parallel structures, fearing that Serb involvement in Kosovo would be the seal of Kosovo’s independence. I do not believe that ‘Standards before Status’ is the only way; so far, it has led us astray. It should be ‘Standards and Status’. We must now set about solving the questions of status. The powder keg of Kosovo will not be kept under control without a trustworthy vision for the future. Sixty per cent of the population are young people and 50% of them have no work. How are we to deal with that when leaders come along who are always stirring things up because Kosovo’s future is not clear? We should give some thought to whether we should not press on more with privatisation and support for businesses, offering financial assistance for jobs that are open to both Albanians and Serbs like in Serbia under Milosevic – similar to the ‘oil for democracy’ plan. So let there be financial assistance for that; I believe this is where the EU could prove useful. The UN must relinquish more of its responsibility to the government in Kosovo and Belgrade must put an end to its parallel structures. Then Albanians and Serbs will at last have to see that they can only govern the country together and that they will only be able to join Europe together, in a country where they have made peace and live together peacefully. Otherwise, any aid from us will really be pointless.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our external policy in relation to the Balkans is an inevitable consequence of the enormous mistakes we made at the beginning of the 1990s; at that time we did not have a common policy for this region, but today we do. The Stability Pact is the right answer to the region's problems. The negotiation of the Stabilisation and Association Process, together with financial assistance such as the CARDS programme and the annual progress review, assists progress towards the frequently mentioned objective of the ultimate accession of these countries to the European Union. So this is the right way to go. What then is this new cliché about ‘European Partnership’? The Stabilisation and Association Agreements are the launch pad for a partnership and if all the criteria are met, the application for membership is the next step. Is there any room for a new catchword without any new financial backing? This proposal from the Council is meaningless, and the Commission knows that, but it cannot say that in so many words. We, on the other hand, can say what we think! Commissioner, the Commission and the Council could demonstrate how serious they are about this much-vaunted partnership by taking Croatia as an example. Croatia has been on the right path for years. Cooperation is good in all areas. The extent of cooperation with The Hague is also positive. Two more generals have just been sent to The Hague. We should not be setting ever-higher standards just because one general with a French passport is still at large and is nowhere to be found. We should remember what has been achieved already. This positive view of Croatia would give a signal and add impetus to compliance with the European Union's criteria throughout the region for which European Partnerships are envisaged – and I know what I am talking about. Our common foreign policy in South Eastern Europe is currently being put to the test, and a rigorous one at that. The proposal for a European Partnership without any substantial added value as compared with the Stabilisation and Association Process and without any additional financial assistance will not, I regret to say, enhance our credibility.

 Mr President, Commissioner, today’s debate on these three much-needed programmes finds us seeking a common legal base for the areas of culture, education and youth. We have had a concertation procedure – I am grateful for the very fine support we got from the Committee on Budgets in that – and now we have some fairly substantial financial resources at our disposal. We could, of course, do with more – these are, after all, areas in which we are dealing with the public, and in particular with young people – but we can be satisfied with what we have. As far as my own area is concerned, I can tell you that EUR 77 million for the action programme for educational institutions is not a trifling amount, but, again, we could do with more. Within all three of these areas there are institutions and associations that are, putting it in the broadest possible terms, educational and cultural ambassadors for Europe and which promote awareness of Europe’s common cultural heritage. For years, often with the help of this House, all these organisations have been doing their work. Without them, Europe’s soul would atrophy even more than it is apparently slowly doing now. I am especially glad that Mrs Iivari has been able to gain acceptance for the idea that cultural institutions should be able to retain their subsidies, at least for a transitional period of two years. Among other things, this is an acknowledgement of these organisations’ work. They can then prepare themselves for the applications they will have to make in response to future invitations to tender. It is at this point that I would like to stress that we MEPs are of course closer to the public than are those who sit in the Commission in Brussels, and so it is a fact that we are more aware of what the public needs. There are three points I would now like to make. As for the first, I would like to take this opportunity to shed more light on the Financial Regulation. Under no circumstances must the lawyers’ mania for regulation be allowed to obstruct our striving for greater transparency and efficiency in our political work on the ground, and I know that the Commission suffers from it just as much as Parliament. The Council, having absolutely no interest in such things, does not, but the problem is that we have the impossible task of defending these things on the ground. Let me just say, with reference to this, that this Financial Regulation and the Commission have now – to take just one example – wrecked the network of Europe Houses that has existed for 50 years. There is a place for that in this debate. I also want to point out that in respect of neither 2003 nor 2004 has the Commission been able to pay to this network the sums of money that this House allocated to it. It is refusing to do so. It is not Mrs Reding who is to be blamed for this, but others; the point simply has to be made that it is the Commission’s fault. It may be that the Financial Regulation that we now have was necessary. The only thing is that it cannot stay the way it is. We have to recognise that a rigorous, not to say fundamentalist, interpretation of this Financial Regulation gives rise to a bureaucracy that distances the public even further from the EU. How are members of the public meant to submit applications if they have to get a consultant to do it for them? It is scarcely credible that all these things should have become so complicated. We must not allow ourselves to be taken hostage by a sort of budgetary imperialism. We should make a real attempt at changing something, and, in the new parliamentary term, join with the Committee on Budgets in finding a new approach. We are neither an assembly of managers nor a board of directors seeking the maximum in bureaucratic efficiency. Rather than being either of those things, we are a political assembly, and our principal task is to respond to the European public’s desires and needs. It is for that reason that I believe we have to make it our business to ensure that money is spent properly, but we must not allow ourselves to be tied into a corset that nobody will find it easy to get out of. My second point is that we expect more from the soul of Europe, and so future budgets need to take more account of education and culture. The third, Commissioner, has to do with the new generation of educational and cultural programmes that you want to speak about today. My expectation of this new generation of programmes is that they should include manageable instruments, by which I mean action at Community level that is capable of being practically implemented, equipped with operational and financial resources in line with what the public want. Everything we do must focus on the public, and let me once again stress that they must not be used as a justification for bureaucratic machinery.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I have three questions to put to you. Firstly, I would like to know if the extension of the Tempus programme to Tempus Plus is a response to the question raised in Thessaloniki as to whether the educational programmes were being extended to the countries of the Balkans. I would see that as not going far enough; I would like to see the whole of the Socrates programme extended, rather than just having Tempus as a new one. Secondly, does the reduction of the Budget line not have the result that we, in this House and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have even less of a say as regards who gets subsidies? What are the facts of the matter here? Thirdly, are the programmes’ titles being lost? Are the names ‘Erasmus’, ‘Socrates’, and ‘Comenius’ no more, or are they being retained somewhere? It is not clear to me from the text. Although I hope I will get an answer to this, I regret that I will not be here to hear it, as I have to go to a briefing before another meeting. Please accept my apologies.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as was laid down in Zagreb and only very recently reconfirmed in Thessaloniki, each of the countries of South-Eastern Europe has its own individual prospect for accession. It follows that we are right to adopt the strategy of commencing negotiations towards a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with each country one at a time. It also follows, however, that preparations for accession are primarily in the hands of the governments in those countries. While all the countries listed in the report have problems specific to themselves, there is much that is, more or less, in equally poor shape in all of them. That is why they have to join with us in stepping up the fight against trafficking in human beings, which actually amounts to trafficking in women. They have to combat crime, arms dealing and corruption. Their justice systems are developed to differing degrees, ranging from the just about acceptable to the utterly inadequate. Education and training are key areas in which these countries also have to make progress or else have no future, as their young people will otherwise leave. No satisfactory solution has yet been found to the problem of refugees returning to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hardly any of the Croats expelled from the Republika Srpska 
are returning to it, which makes the return of Serbs to Croatia and the restoration of their property there more difficult. A creditable number of Serbs are returning to Croatia, but implementing the restoration of property to Croatia’s Serbs is still not progressing in a satisfactory way. There is, moreover, a great deal of anti-Serb sentiment in several regions, especially in the hinterland of Zadar, and this results in major problems on the ground. In contrast, co-existence in Eastern Slavonia around Vukovar is characterised to a much greater degree by cooperation. There is a good law on minorities, which community leaders must now put into practice. Croatia is cooperating properly with The Hague; even archive documents have been handed over to the tribunal. Indeed, it was in Croatia itself that three accused persons, including a General, received lengthy jail sentences. One accused person, General Gotovina, is on the run. Let us not ask for the impossible; the state has offered a reward for his capture, but so far have not managed to track him down. He is a member of the French Foreign Legion and holds a French passport; heaven knows where he is now. If the international community could not get its hands on Karadzic or Mladic despite SFOR having been present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for seven years, then we should not, in this regard, apply the wrong standard to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to the Croats. Serbia and Montenegro have demonstrated their willingness to cooperate with The Hague. Things could get even better. They handed Milosevic over, thank God, as well as the three butchers of Vukovar, but many more are still awaiting extradition. It is in Serbia’s interests to be allowed to sentence some war criminals in Serbia itself. It would help the Serbs’ understanding of the situation if the KLA leadership were also, at last, to stand trial in The Hague for their crimes. There is an absolute need for improvements in the poor economic state of much of the region, and so the CARDS programme must facilitate more infrastructural measures than before, or else there will be no recovery there. There have been improvements in Bosnia-Herzegovina’s development at State level, but there are still many deficits. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that the High Representative does not always make use of the powers he possesses. The metaphorical sword of Damocles hanging over Bosnia-Herzegovina would be unnecessary if the EU were – as Commissioner Vitorino has just said – to make demands that Bosnia-Herzegovina can actually meet. I ought also to say something about Albania, but I shall skip that; everything is in the report, and I assume that everyone has read it. My congratulations to Mr Lagendijk.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need to have basic legal acts that allow the Commission to proceed according to clearly defined principles when approving and managing grants. The authorising officer, in other words, the Commission, needs such guidelines in order to comply with both the Financial Regulation and the wishes of the budgetary authority, namely Parliament. I very much regret, however, Commissioner, the time pressure we are under, for which we are not responsible. The Commission adopted this act at the end of May and we were unable to examine it earlier, and I find we are yet again in difficulties under such pressure of time. There was no need for it, because it was clear, even before the Financial Regulation was adopted, that the present grants from Part A have to be replaced by multiannual programmes and it is therefore impossible to understand why the proposal came so late. We are being made to bear the consequences of something that is not our fault. Whose fault will it be if beneficiaries do not get any subsidies early next year? The Commission will point its finger at us, the Council probably will too. But it is not our fault. We like to work carefully. This time, again, we were not able to. We really must do our best to ensure that it does not happen again, but we say that every time and I am having to say it again now. We have three reports, which Mrs Prets has already mentioned, and I agree with much of what she said. All three reports contain institutions and associations which are active as cultural ambassadors for Europe in the widest sense and which promote and foster the common cultural heritage in Europe. This House has for years supported all these organisations; it even founded some of them. Those that have been formed recently do not know that, of course, like the Youth Orchestra, the College of Europe, the University Institute in Florence, the Law Academy in Trier, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, the Mercator Network of Information and Documentation Centres, or the European Youth Forum. Up until now these organisations really have done their job of providing information and working for the integration of Europe. This also includes something that we have not created, but for whose existence I am grateful and for which you all really should be grateful: the FIME network, which has been working for European integration for 50 years in 118 houses in 32 European countries. That is why I am unable to understand what you unfortunately found it necessary to say – I assume you were forced to do so by those who today briefed you with completely incorrect information. In my opinion, we must say that the FIME is working well, that the FIME had an excellent audit early this year, that the FIME underwent an audit again three weeks ago, which consisted only in being asked to get all its files – 300 of them – to Brussels so they can be inspected there. The FIME has offered to allow everything in it to be looked at properly, as laid down in an agreement with the Commission. The result of that was that DG Press said that none of it was in order. I can only say that what they reported was not in order. We promised the FIME EUR 2.2 million in the last financial year. It got none of that money this year, nothing, simply because one of the FIME’s houses, Avignon, was guilty of a EUR 200 000 fraud. Those EUR 200 000 could easily have been deducted from the 2.4 million and then the FIME would have been able to work. If the Commission applied to itself the standards it applied to the FIME in this case, it would have been out of office long ago. (Applause)
 I had to say that because I am simply furious. Unfortunately, my adversary is now Mrs Reding who cannot do anything about it. She repeated what she had been given to say and I can only say that what she was given to say is not in accordance with the facts. And it can be checked by the courts. The opinion of our group on the subject of earmarking: We are in favour of earmarking. We will vote in favour of it. We are against degressivity. We will therefore also vote accordingly. I would like to say once again in connection with earmarking here that I am glad the Commission has proposed retaining earmarking. No doubt it did so because it knows that we as Members of the European Parliament are closer to the citizens than the officials sitting here in Brussels, and they know that we know what may be politically and also culturally relevant in these individual cases. The Financial Regulation cannot rate higher than a basic act or than this budgetary authority. That cannot be and I therefore believe, as our legal service has also said, that earmarking is right. I hope that together we will get it through because I believe it will bring us closer to our common desire of bringing the citizens to Europe, of really finding the soul of Europe, than will what others have proposed here.

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, we have been in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport until now, where we voted on three very complicated reports. That is why I arrived so out of breath, but we did very well. I would like to thank Mrs de Sarnez for carrying out her work with such determination and so much drive. In doing so she achieved what we wanted to achieve; we will be able to start the Erasmus Mundus programme at the beginning of 2004. This report emphasises something that is very dear to Parliament, that is, we are creating a European learning area, an expression we were not allowed to use in relation to Socrates II. Today, I think everyone is talking in such terms and that, I believe, is a good thing. We are bringing Europe back onto the international stage. Europe will become more competitive and more attractive to young people from abroad. As against the EUR 180 million that the Commission wanted, we have set a figure of EUR 230 million. Achieving this increase took a great deal of effort, but I believe that it is also a reflection of the ambitions we have for this programme. To be genuinely appealing such a programme requires financing. We put further emphasis on language learning and that is a very important point because the students who come here study in three different countries and we expect them to try to learn at least two of the languages of these countries. I see Erasmus Mundus as a marvellous way of continuing Socrates-Erasmus, and I believe that we will make this programme a great success in 2004, the very year that the European elections are taking place. I hope that in so doing and in showing what we are capable of, we will make this a real attraction in the European Union and beyond. These students, coming from outside the EU, will be able to study in three places in Europe; they will assimilate the cultural diversity of the European Union, they will learn the languages and they will carry Europe’s message abroad. I am glad that we have come so far together on this road. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on just one point in your debate today. You mentioned it in only one sentence. I should like to say something about the Balkans and south-eastern Europe. I very much welcomed your initiative and I am also delighted that the Thessaloniki paper, that was prepared together with the Commission, has been adopted, because it contains much of what Parliament has demanded. Obviously I now hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that as an ordinary Member of the Council you will work together with the new Council Presidency to implement its content. We are still waiting for it to be implemented in the countries of the Balkans. It would be nice if the EU and the Council could actually agree to implement the decisions that they make in papers of this kind. This involves, for example, opening up education and youth programmes to the young people of these countries, which sends out an extremely important signal to them. It also involves annual reports on progress in the individual States, and the reinforcement of the twinning programme so as to modernise the administrative structures in these countries and make them ready for the accession that they have, of course, been promised. We expect there to be more cooperation in the region, particularly between Greece and Italy and these countries, on human trafficking and cross-border crime. We also hope that you will perhaps consider, together with your colleagues in the Council and the Commission, easing the visa requirements in a number of fields and for particular professions, so that people are able to gain faster entry to the European Union. I very much hope that positive progress is made when we start, as we are now doing, to initiate discussions between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians. I would be very pleased if you, as a country bordering the Balkans, could help to move this forward. I very much hope that the Serb, Roma and Ashkali refugees will at last be able to return to Kosovo so that the conditions can be put in place to enable them to live there side by side. I think that the Council and the Commission need to step up the pressure on the Albanians in Kosovo in this regard. We did not wage a war to have a situation today that is not wholly dissimilar to the unpleasant state of affairs that we have seen there over the last ten years. I believe that we need to be more deeply committed, because of course we want these countries to return to stability and peace. That is also the case in Serbia and I would urge you to use your influence to stop the Serbian Government continuing to gag journalists, as it is now doing. Media freedom in Serbia is under threat. Please give your word. Do not tolerate it! Otherwise, thank you very much for your commitment. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I welcome the Greek Presidency's statements about the Balkans, and unlike Mr Alavanos I am also pleased that in the second half of this year the Italians will have an opportunity to pursue this excellent policy further. There are in fact two neighbouring countries that have a vital interest in seeing stability in the Western Balkans, that is to say in south-eastern Europe. It is a fact that these countries – Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Albania – are at very different stages in their development. They will ultimately have an opportunity, as already promised in Zagreb and as will once again be confirmed in Thessaloniki, to become members of the European Union depending on their own individual progress. The road they have to travel will be a difficult one, as the 10 accession countries have discovered. It will place great demands on their citizens. We recognise the different rates of progress that exist, which are chiefly due to the fact that these countries have all had different opportunities to develop. Until just two years ago, Serbia and Montenegro still had Milosevic. We therefore need to take into consideration those opportunities of which they were unable to take advantage. Many of these problems are, however, common to all these countries, such as the fight against corruption and organised crime, and above all the fight against traffic in human beings. In many of these countries the judicial system is still very poor and deficient. Another cause for regret is that cooperation at regional level is not as good as it is always made out to be. If an appeal is being made to us to grant these countries visa freedom, then, in my opinion, they should first come to an agreement between themselves to allow their own citizens to travel freely. It is not that simple to get from Serbia to Croatia. (Applause)
 That is why I believe that these countries should first put their own house in order before they start making further demands on us. I also believe that bilateral free trade areas are a good thing. However, they can only be truly effective if they are extended to create a multilateral free trade area. I would like to mention three points contained in our motion for a resolution. It is reasonable for the Stability Pact to be closely linked with the stabilisation and association process. It is important that the CARDS programme, for which ever less funding is available, should be given more money. The money is available; we do not need to create new funding. The pre-accession aid has not been fully used, and I regret that the Commissioner mentioned a figure of EUR 200 million. You probably do not want to exceed that figure, but I believe that we need more, because economic development is a prerequisite for our co-existence, for the development of this Community and for the ultimate solution of the problems of refugees. I would like to touch upon one final issue, and that is the question of young people in these countries. Without their youth, these countries will have no chance of developing favourably. If they are not given a signal now that Europe will not become a reality just for their grandchildren, but now, for them, there will be problems. They are all trying to leave these countries and to emigrate to other countries, such as New Zealand, the United States and Canada. We must open up our Socrates and Leonardo programmes to them. As the rapporteur for the Socrates programme, I know what a difficult business that is. I appeal to the Greek Presidency to play an active role here in ensuring that we really give the young people of these countries a signal that they can take part in our educational programmes. If I rightly understood the communiqué issued by the presidents of these countries on Monday, it contains many good things – many promises and many valuable insights. I only hope that something will be done in Thessaloniki to give these countries a real incentive to translate those promises into action. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would just like to speak about the part for which Mrs Diamantopoulou is not responsible, namely culture, youth, education, media and sport. But I think you are also representing Mrs Reding here. Before the report was even planned by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we had already made an enquiry to this effect, but then – for whatever reason – it was delayed for months. So at last we are getting together to debate this issue, and together we should try to make the best of it. We realise that these coordination procedures exist, and as a European politician I would actually be pleased if some people – people in positions of responsibility, politicians – would coordinate their activities. These people, however, are precisely the people who are usually trying to deny us our authority. They coordinate their activities in areas where they do not want to grant us any responsibility at all: in the field of culture and education. They are suddenly coordinating in these areas without being accountable to us. This strikes us as rather suspect. The problem is that we are being treated like NGOs in this area. We are not NGOs, however, but elected representatives, and we ought to know what exactly is being negotiated in our name behind the scenes. Moreover, it is not only the Council that is content with this; the Commission too, unfortunately, is very pleased about it. You see, in this way it has managed to oust an awkward player from the field. The Council and the Commission have joined forces here – which could even be a good thing, but I would like to use Machiavelli’s words here and say, ‘Not every end justifies the means’. For this reason, I believe that we have to be very cautious in this case, and that we should expect to be included. It has now transpired that what has developed is an intergovernmental method. And once something like this has got under way, is it very difficult to stop it again. Although we now know that the Convention, which has little to say about coordination, declared its opposition to the open variety of it, we also know that all national presidents should coordinate with each other, where the need arises, even in instances not necessarily covered by the Treaty. We really need to be careful, however, not to let ourselves be excluded. From the point of view of culture and education, I can actually say that it is really hypocritical that we are not allowed to be active in precisely those areas where we would be happy to be involved. Then, in a roundabout fashion, in the context of this open method of coordination, we have the same things that we would be happy to do, but we are not included. This is simply unacceptable, and we must fight against it. We should recall that an intergovernmental method may not be introduced indirectly. We should see to it – including by means of today’s debate – that this existing intergovernmental method, in other words open coordination, is converted into a Community method. If heads of governments or individual ministers recognise something to be right and necessary and important, then this too should be converted to the Community method, so that we, as elected representatives of our peoples, can participate. I ask that this be taken into account and thank all those who were involved. (Applause)

 I approve the accession of the Czech Republic because I take the view that the reunification of Europe and thus also the return of the Czechs to the European family must not be halted by the irresponsibility of those Czech politicians who have still not yet grasped how a modern state functions under the rule of law. It is to be hoped that the lasting injustice of certain of the Beneš decrees continuing in existence will be able to be done away with more speedily within the EU than if we refuse to admit the Czech Republic to it.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to underline the fact that Mrs De Sarnez, by using the title ‘Erasmus Mundus’ has found the right expression, and I am glad that she has. It needs no explanation; that this is a better description than Erasmus World is self-explanatory. For ‘Mundus’ shows that we have a multiplicity of languages and do not express ourselves in only one language, the so-called lingua franca,
 English. So I am glad that we have chosen the Latin word. Mrs De Sarnez' report takes up three points that are of great importance to us on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and also in my group. The first is the European dimension and the European value that the opportunity of mobility adds to education. Secondly, Europe is given an enhanced presence on the international stage, becoming more attractive and also more competitive – particularly in the field of university education. The third point is the accent on language learning, and here I want to contradict all those who have said that this is not important. I am glad that this additional amendment is there, for it is the learning of our region's languages that helps the people who come to us to grasp its cultural diversity. Fourthly, the increase to EUR 300 million reflects the desire to create a real European educational area. If, on a Sunday, I talk about how important that is, if I make statements about it in Bologna or in Lisbon, only, on Monday, to fail to make the money available, then the written word is worthless. That is why we should remind our masters in the Council that they now have to make their contribution, in order to do justice to the high expectations they have of themselves. The stunning success of the Socrates/Erasmus programme, on which I was the rapporteur on more than one occasion, is the inspiration behind this new programme. Erasmus has enabled a million students to study, and both programmes, which are mutually complementary, make it possible to gain an additional qualification abroad. They also facilitate access to European languages, to European culture and to European values. They are indispensable in terms of cultural understanding and dialogue, both of which have been mentioned a number of times today. This means that the limited budget that we have must be replenished. That is an obstacle. There is also a lack of demand on the part of teachers, for whom there is the hindrance that what they do abroad is often not recognised at home. With the new programmes, that are soon to follow, in mind, we have to give some thought to how we can really harmonise these programmes with each other. I would also like to make another appeal that has not so far been heard today. It is an appeal to the Convention, that these measures – Socrates, Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus – should not be merely support measures, but rather supplementary competences, which we value, and which constitute the heart of the European Union. That is something you could find out if you were at last to talk with the public instead of constantly peering at your books! (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Mauro report does indeed contain proposals for making this programme even more effective. It was already very good the way the Commission had proposed it, but the proposals Mr Mauro has made improve it still further. Above all, I believe that the apportionment of funds – as he envisages it – enables this programme better to meet the demands that we make of it. I cannot see how these paltry resources are meant to enable us to bridge what is called the digital divide, which is for real and consists in the fact that, in some countries, many schools are equipped with computers, while, in others, very few have them. That is why we have tried something for which I also thank Mr Mauro, namely to make you more aware of this. Our amendment is among the twenty-four that aim to get schools communicating with each other and more money spent on equipping them with computers. The other question, as to how we can close this digital divide between one nation and another, cannot be answered on this occasion. This is a gap that can perhaps be filled by using money from the Cohesion Fund or from the Social and Regional Fund. This approach to the eLearning Programme must, as you said, be increasingly directed towards the creation of synergies between existing programmes and the eLearning Programme. If we attach particular importance to schools being linked up to each other through a network, that is something that can be firmly tied into the 'COMENIUS' programme, and which actually has been hitherto, probably without any support. I have seen this in many schools that I have visited in connection with the COMENIUS programme. I believe, then, that this is where we have to forge a new partnership, one that promotes eLearning as an aid to language learning, as well as intercultural dialogue, above all in schools. When we talk in terms of a virtual campus, that of course relates to what we were discussing earlier in connection with the De Sarnez Report. There must be a close connection with Erasmus and Erasmus World. If we are to achieve the best results, we have to combine virtual mobility and physical mobility. I would like, moreover, to underline what Mr Mauro said earlier. There is a massive shortage of teachers, and the attempt must be made, with the help of this programme, to compensate for it. Teachers should not lag behind their pupils, but really should be a bit further ahead, so that they can inject greater stimulus into this area. The eLearning Programme – as at present envisaged – is an important addition to all the educational programmes currently in existence. Again, sincere thanks for all the work you have done. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we used to learn at school: ‘Mens sana in corpore sano’ – a healthy mind in a healthy body, and we are, in theory, all acquainted with this wisdom from ancient Rome. Of all leisure activities, sport is the most widespread, with one out of every three Europeans participating in some form of it, some of them, indeed, continuing to do so well into old age. Physical activity promotes health, and competition in sport develops a range of social skills, such as friendship, team spirit, solidarity, commitment, perseverance and, last but not least, fair play. As you will all be aware, you can tell a good sportsman by the way he wins, but a great one by the way he loses. Despite sport's essential social role, ladies and gentlemen, there is no policy on it at Community level. We have therefore been campaigning in this House for a number of years already, for the legal basis for this to be enshrined in the Treaties. We can therefore unreservedly welcome the way the Commissioner has at last responded to the aspiration expressed in my last report on sport, produced as long ago as 1996, and proclaimed a year of sport. It is admittedly not being called the Year of Sport, but, for many understandable reasons, the ‘Year of Education through Sport 2004’. It is about using a large number of projects to highlight sport's role in informal learning and its educational value, and also the close partnership between school sport and the services provided by the many kinds of sporting organisations that exist in Europe. To come to the point, the objective and rationale of the ‘European Year of Education through Sport 2004’ is not to show what people are capable of in the sporting arena – something that we can demonstrate to ourselves to our own satisfaction every day of the year on dozens of television channels – but to show what sport can do in human terms and for people. There is consensus in this House as regards the Year's seven objectives. It is to promote cooperation between educational institutions and sporting organisations, the development of social skills through sport, voluntary activity, pupils' mobility by means of international competitions, a balance between mental and physical activity, as well as consideration of how the educational needs of young sportsmen and women are to be met. Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this House at First Reading stage. What is important is that it has confirmed the amount of funding involved, the EUR 11.5 million that the Commission believes to be sufficient to complete in this Year those things that it has in mind to do. If everyone now plays their part – and that includes the media – then this Year can be of truly great significance for sport. I very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round. By means of this Year, we want to build up networks and give an impetus to cross-border cooperation. What we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects. Research is always in progress, and that is not what this Year is for. I believe that the only research we need is to ask ourselves, when it is all over, ‘what has this Year achieved?’ but otherwise not to spend money on it. The Council shares our view on this. It has also accepted my idea of organising a European competition in the run-up to the Olympic Games – incorporating it, not into the Treaty, but into a protocol. I am very happy about this, and I very much hope that the Commission will respond to our concern by announcing a competition culminating in its victors being allowed to be present at the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia in 2004. That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport. What, ladies and gentlemen, is all this about? It is our intention to establish a platform for educational measures in sport above and beyond frontiers, institutions of state education and organisations. We want to kick-start cross-border initiatives and networks, and we have to set up an ideas exchange, enabling exemplary projects and initiatives – that is to say best practices – to be followed by as many as possible during the preparations in 2003 and the actual Year in 2004. The Community projects instrument will receive 80% support, and those things done at national level alone will receive 50% co-financing. This seems to me to be very well suited to putting this Year's European dimension centre-stage. I think I will leave it at that, but would like to thank the Council and the Commission and express the hope that we will all be able to take the idea of this Year of Education through Sport back to our communities, and that, eventually, the Convention will be astute enough to give sport a legal basis.

 Mr President, Joost Lagendijk's report covers a great many issues, and we cannot comment on all of them here. However, I would like to start by saying that I totally support it, and that applies equally to my group. This part of Europe is a multi-speed region. Some countries, such as Macedonia and Croatia, already have agreements; theirs are stabilisation and association agreements, although that does not of course necessarily mean that all the conditions are being complied with in detail. Joost has already listed the deficits. It is, however, with some satisfaction that we can consider Albania, a country which has managed to make up for the fraudulent elections held in 2001 by electing a consensus president, something very few people expected, including the Commission. We would now like to see an early start made on the negotiations around this process, although we know that it will not be concluded rapidly, as there is still a lot of homework to be done. Turning to Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has to be said that this country is struggling to square the circle. I am referring to the Dayton Agreement. I simply wish to say, for example, that 67% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entire budget is spent on ministers' salaries. There are over 120 ministers who only exist because they are virtually stipulated in the Dayton Agreement. Something has to be done about this and the last elections were a warning signal. Serbia and Montenegro's President and Prime Minister are squabbling with each other instead of jointly fighting for their country. Serbia and Montenegro should now be finding a joint path towards European membership, and the Solana proposal, no matter how limited it may be, is at present the best and the only way forward. With regard to Kosovo, which I visited again just last week, I can only say that we should be able to make sure that its peoples can coexist, thus making Serbian enclaves unnecessary. They have many problems in common. There are ethnic tensions in some countries, there are unsatisfactory refugee return arrangements, there is the battle against trafficking in human beings, which is also unsatisfactory, and there is corruption. Only one thing is clear, and that is that we must not back off from our commitment. That is the litmus test for our credibility. As Joost has already said, we need to have a precise idea of what we wish to achieve in this region in the near future. (Applause)

 Mr President, I assume that it had escaped Mr de Gaulle's mind that our discussion today is on theatre rather than television or journalists. I would prefer to speak to the matter on the agenda. I wish to congratulate Mrs Fraisse and say something on just a couple of points that have not yet been mentioned today. First of all, I am glad that a Member has taken up this matter again after an interval of ten years, in the course of which the issue has lost none of its topicality. It was in 1992 that I produced a report on the state of artists, and I can only say that I still search in vain today for the practical results that the Commission could have brought about in these ten years. Whilst believing that the topics addressed today are very multi-faceted, I would nonetheless like to limit myself to two things, the first being the way in which the cultural sector is financed at both national and European level. It is the subject of politicians' speeches, but does not give rise to political action, and it is for that reason that I believe much is still amiss in this area. I would like to observe that there are two things that are in need of improvement. Firstly, the Culture 2002 programme, to which Mrs Reding has already referred, has to have more money allocated to it; if the Council of Ministers suddenly attaches such importance to culture, then it should provide funds for it. In addition, we should also bear in mind that it is the performing arts that are popular with quite specific viewers and listeners. So far, these are small-scale projects, for which the Commission has no love, but which we want because the public likes them! Secondly, the private sector must be involved more than it has been before. Patronage and sponsorship are important. There are no Budget resources available, and so we have to look for ways to enable people with a lot of money to spend it in the right way. That is why we should do more about this. I regret the way that the coalition agreements in my own country mean that it is precisely this that is to be done away with. Thirdly, artists face a very large number of technical obstacles in terms of the material they have to work with, and here in particular the Commission could really do something, for example, for circuses and small travelling theatres. Please do something in this area; it would be a great help to the performers!

 Mr President, I too have something to say about paragraph 47, but it is something rather more important. There is something wrong with it. It contains the words: ‘… a treaty concluded last month between the Republic of Yugoslavia and Macedonia’, but the treaty was concluded last year. It sparked the crisis in Kosovo. I ask that this serious mistake be corrected.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today finds us dealing with a report that has been unanimously adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, thus showing that the Members on the Committee took the view that the approach I have proposed in it is the right one. These ladies and gentlemen, though, had the opportunity in January to listen to a number of members of the Albanian parliament address the Committee. They were able to form for themselves a conception of how mature this country and its politicians are. I would rather not repeat what my colleagues said during that debate. Unfortunately, though, I did not get the impression that my colleagues' remarks, and my own, during that debate helped get all the region's politicians at last to realise that they, whether in government or opposition, actually had to engage in politics for the sake of the whole of the Albanian people! So I have already come to the conclusion that here we are submitting a report that is somewhat stringent, not stringent out of any lack of affection for the Albanian people, but because we perhaps care more for them than do some politicians in that country, who are less concerned with the well-being of the people than with their own pockets and their own positions. I say this because I know the people there and because I also know their politicians, and so I do think that, rather than beat about the bush, we should actually say out loud that, last year, elections were held. They were rigged. We then allowed them not to be repeated, but then – as the election had been rigged to bring about a sufficient majority in the parliament, which was to elect the president in June – asked for the presidential election, at least, not to be held, but for politicians instead to unite and try to find a figure who could then be a president for all Albanians, rather than an Albanian president who owed his position to a stolen majority. I am therefore very grateful that Members have followed me on points 4 and 5, in which we asked the Albanians, before the Commission resumes negotiations with them, to at least comply with all the requirements of the OSCE/ODIHR election observers' committee, allowing that committee to begin its work in the parliament, checking that new electoral legislation is also set in motion and that the political forces should give some consideration to who, in Albania, can lead that country in such a way as to unite it. Now there are many who say that the opening of negotiations of course means that everything can be monitored much better. That I do not believe! We go there more than we do anywhere else. Albania is the only country in the world for which there is a friendship association in which states and organisations join together and meet several times a year in order to help the country – and what has been the result? I know that Albania has had a worse fate to endure than any other country in Europe. We know that. Hoxha was no Tito, nor was he a Honecker. Hoxha was Hoxha and he was appalling. But Albania has now for some time been free of Hoxha, and so we could have expected things to get a bit better. There are no end of things to do, though. Albania does not do what it has to do because it has to draw closer to Europe. Albania has to do these things out of the desire to be a proper democracy, because it wants the best for its citizens, and for that it needs decent jurisprudence, administrative practice and people to be enabled to have the property of which they were dispossessed restored to them, for which a proper infrastructure is required. Albania also needs all these things in order to attract investors. It needs the confidence of foreign investors, and for that it needs good policies. I take the view that the Council would be well advised to seek advice from us, as it is we who will, at the end of the day, have to approve the Agreement. I believe that the Commission's thinking is basically along the same lines as our own – that we should not make a start until the Albanian politicians have, in some way, demonstrated their willingness to take a step forwards. Then we will at once be ready to seek negotiations with them in which all the things they now have to work on will be sorted out. Let me remind you that we go there several times each year and are trying everything to help Albania, and that what we are saying today is intended simply to help them rather than being directed against the people. That is why I am very grateful that our vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy was unanimous. I would be delighted if our vote tomorrow were to be so as well.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recall how, in my last report on sport, in 1996, I called for the designation of a Year of Sport. Now we have one, but it took until Viviane Reding's appointment as a Commissioner for us to get it. That is a fine thing all the same, and I am grateful, but when I consider the title we have given this year, everything in me tenses up – it really is nonsense! Why do we have to tie ourselves in knots when talking about sport? I wanted a Year of Sport, and now we have a Year of Education through Sport. We all know why we are going around in circles; it is because sport should not actually be an issue, although it is one, not only as regards football but everywhere! At every hour of every day, everyone is talking about sport. It is only in the European Union that it is not meant to have a part to play. Why do we have to engage in such contortions? Sport has always crossed national boundaries. Here in Europe, it is by means of a common agency that we are combating the reprehensible practice of doping in sport. So there is sport in Europe. With the TV directive, we are also concerning ourselves with sports rights. So there is sport in Europe. It actually surpasses my understanding why the EU governments are still balking at it, and that is why I hope that, the next time you assemble together, you will have learned something from the Year of Education through Sport and will make of it a real European-level task which will not, of course, be proceeded with outside the bounds of subsidiarity. We adopted this Commission proposal with a very great deal of goodwill. Indeed, we had hardly any problems with it, but Parliament does, of course, table amendments. We went along with the proposal as regards finance. I told myself, of course, that I had done the decent thing by not asking for more money, and then the Council went and said it was still too much! I will bear that in mind for the next time, when I will again make demands, and then perhaps we will even get more than what you have proposed. Thus we have been very successful in some programmes. I actually wanted it to be an overnight success, but – alas – that was not the case. Things seem to have settled down in the meantime, though. We have not done as the Commission said in every respect. In one area, we stated that we would under no circumstances be willing to spend more money this year on research and investigations. We stated that all the money allocated for this year must also be spent on tangible schemes either in this year or as an interim payment. We made an exception to this for evaluation. There is bound to be one after a year of this sort, but this one is not in the part we want to try and delete. We hope, of course, that the Commission will support us in this. We tabled amendments to enhance and promote the contribution made by unpaid work to informal education, to promote the spread of ‘best practice’ and to create an on-line database. We want to support networks to spread the education role of sport, and we have shed light on the major problem of the many competitive sportsmen and sportswomen who are unable to gain educational qualifications, because they reached the peak of their performance during their schooldays and then, to some extent, neglected their performance at school. This European Year is an important one, happening across Europe in the year of the Summer Olympic Games in Athens, and measures will be implemented at Community and national level to promote long-term cooperation between education providers and sports associations 
and to better integrate sporting practice and sporting values into teaching. As the whole business struck me as a bit too dry, I took the liberty of devising a climax for this sporting year, and my fellow members of the committee went along with me. Let us, I said, have an athletics competition between school teams right across Europe in 2003, at the end of which the competition's winners will be invited to Olympia in 2004, where the Olympic flame is lit. I thought this was a brilliant idea. Our world lives on images, great images, and these images also depict actions. I must say that I would actually have liked our dear Commissioner to be a bit more supportive in putting this to the Council. The Council is against it. Now, all I want to say is that it does not cost much more, and there will, indeed, probably be no additional expense whatever, as we still have money in reserve. Of course, we do not always have to tell the Council that, but we do have money. We can do it, and we should be able to afford it. I really cannot understand why they do not want us to! We will certainly succeed in carrying off the vote for first reading without difficulty. I wish the Council would get a move on, as we had to, and get its common position out by 31 May. I can include my colleagues on the committee in promising that we are willing to take it into committee as quickly as possible, and, if necessary, to use a trilogue to ensure that we do not have to resort to a conciliation procedure. I think though that the Council still has to take a few steps in our direction on that point. I would be very grateful if the Commission could help them in that direction. Again, many thanks for presenting this, Mrs Reding. We are grateful that it has at last arrived!

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, on behalf of our group, to thank Mrs De Sarnez, who has drafted an excellent report. I would like to point out that this ‘Europe of knowledge’, which we have come to use as a common expression, has to give an account of itself at an international level. This is an important challenge, and the declarations at Lisbon and Barcelona, or what was adopted in Bologna or Prague, are also important. If, though, they only result in everything being done, at the end of the day, in a so-called open coordination that bypasses Parliament, then that is something we simply cannot agree to. We agree with the contents, but also want to be involved. The challenges we face are great. As I have said, we have to give an account of ourselves, and I agree with Mrs De Sarnez that we must increasingly see to it that our education becomes more appealing and more competitive. In the European Union, we need something like a community with a first-rate knowledge-based society, of which we can then make real use. For that, we need more mobility. As Mrs De Sarnez has already said, mobility and the quality of our education are the most important things, and so there are of course a number of things we have to do. We must also make it our concern that more languages are taught and learned in higher education institutions. We must make it our concern to have more common leaving certificates. The Franco-German college in Germany, at which common leaving certificates can be taken, could serve as an example for many other European higher education institutions. In competition, we should stand or fall by whether we get this on the move. The university label proposed by Mrs De Sarnez strikes me as excellent, and so we must work at making it a reality. We must also act more quickly than we have in the past to ensure that leaving certificates and diplomas are at last recognised. We have been saying this for ever and a day and yet progress is being made at a snail's pace. This is damaging our young people, and I do think this is a challenge for all of us and one that we should take up.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing that must be said is that Socrates is a success story. Education was successful under Erasmus, but I think that, embedded in the Socrates programme, it has fared even better. That is one positive finding in this evaluation of the second stage of the European Union programme on general education. Socrates takes account of the concept of lifelong learning and supports mobility at all stages of learning, of students and teachers alike. To put it one way, Socrates is there for us from the cradle to the grave. The Commission has taken precautions and measures, one step at a time, to improve the content of the programme. I welcome ongoing efforts to speed up procedures and cut red tape. Red tape is inevitable in a government programme at any level, but red tape should not be an obstacle to this sort of education programme and should not obstruct its objectives. The Commission has taken account of this premise on numerous counts. I shall come shortly to the areas in which it has not. As rapporteur on both the introduction of the first phase and the implementation of the current second stage of the Socrates programme, I am satisfied how well it has developed. The figures for the first half of the programme speak for themselves. In 31 countries – that is, the 15 Member States, the candidate countries and the members of the European Economic Area – 2 000 universities, 40 000 university lecturers and more than 460 000 students took part in further education exchanges under Erasmus alone. Comenius, the section for schools, funded 15 000 schools with over 2 million pupils. I think we really are reaching our citizens here and I think it really is worth our while to continue and, if possible, build up this programme even more. This being so, the increase in the multiannual budget from the original figure of EUR 850 million to a current EUR 933 million – achieved by Parliament during all-night sittings – was the right thing to do. But, to be honest, it is not enough. If new candidate countries join in 2004 – the programme runs until 2007 – then this programme needs to be built up. And if the Council of Ministers refuses to do so, then all I can say is that its declarations at the summits are nothing more than hot air and I think the Commissioner should point out as much to the ministers at forthcoming Council meetings. Of course, I also have a few criticisms to make. Several initiatives still have room for improvement when it comes to the nitty-gritty. First, the Commission should improve and speed up cooperation with national agencies even more. Centralisation has huge advantages but requires effective information management. The Symmetry system developed by the Commission will clearly facilitate the flow of information to and from the national agencies here. But at the same time, we can – and it makes sense to – link up with the Youth and Leonardo da Vinci programmes. Symmetry therefore needs to be introduced as quickly as possible. Secondly, I would point out that an overwhelming number of national agencies gave me to understand that the Commission is helpful at all stages. But the time taken to prepare new contracts has resulted in disgraceful delays in payments, especially under Comenius. Such obstacles must be removed because hold-ups and delays are a source of frustration to committed participants. Especially in schools, where a great deal of extra effort goes into setting up projects. I know of schools where the teachers running the project are smiled upon by their colleagues. They do it in their spare time and do not get paid a penny more. Thirdly, I also expect something to be done about creating joint actions, especially with the other programmes I mentioned. Fourthly, I also call on the Commission to adopt the premise: the smaller the sum, the less red tape. I think we could follow the example set by the Commission with the partnership agreements, that is, to deal with applications under 20 000 differently, without the mound of paperwork needed for larger sums. I also think that the cofinancing requirement should be dropped below EUR 20 000. The fundamental contribution of Socrates to a European education area has been applauded repeatedly and is beyond question. We should not forget that Socrates is the heartbeat of a European society of knowledge and learning and what worries me is that transnational, that is, intergovernmental cooperation on education might displace the Community approach. However, the Bologna and Prague declarations were in favour of these supposedly faster methods. We must not forget that the means and ends of the so-called open method of cooperation with the Member States on education would have been more or less unthinkable without the positive experience gained from Socrates. To sacrifice Community education objectives to short-term transnational cooperation would be an unspeakable step backwards. To close, we need to bear two further points in mind. First, Socrates is an important, decisive European programme, because it educates people in Europe and is the European answer to the education prospects of the future. Secondly, the open method of intergovernmental cooperation must not be allowed to undermine the importance of the Community approach. (Applause)

Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura for having taken so much time and trouble in his effort to pinpoint Parliament's political guidelines, which also underlie this programme, in the implementation of the programme. For example, how does this programme give our citizens improved access to and participation in culture? What actions involve our fellow citizens? The huge administrative costs and the criteria for handling the programme cannot conceal the programme's original objectives, nor should they call them into question. Having read the report, we must state, loud and clear, exactly what we expect of a European cultural policy, especially in the run up to enlargement and the forthcoming convention. If you talk to artists today, they are all worried that culture will get buried under the convention, under the debate on subsidiarity. I hope it does not and we shall fight to see that it does not. How can the mechanics of the programme be improved, so that it becomes a real cultural tool which meets the requirements of artists and citizens alike? Should the programme support the arts sector or work for the good of society? Given the current situation, these are the questions we need to ask when we think of the future. Needless to say, this, too, is a programme which needs to be put on a better financial footing if we are to avoid creating frustration rather than satisfaction. I do not want to anticipate the debate on the follow-up programme post-2004, but even Mr Graça Moura addressed this point because it is already well under way at the Commission, and the report calls on us to start giving it serious thought so as to avoid leaving the field open, including at the convention, to the enemies of any form of culture policy work at EU level. We should all remember that a European cultural policy which respects our citizens' differences and cultural traditions goes straight to the heart of the political debate. In other words, it is the only way of giving Europe a soul.

 Mr President, on behalf of all members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would like to make a heartfelt plea that we should not, as planned, have a combined debate on culture, education and youth on Thursday morning, as these three topics should not be thrown together. There may well be points of contact between them, but they need to be dealt with separately. I ask that these three topics be dealt with in the same time as set aside for the joint debate, and I believe that this is something that this House would support. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome today's debate. I am delighted that we are holding it at the end of the European Year of Languages, because we have tried several times during the course of this year to persuade the Commission to do something about lesser-used languages. The Commission's standard response has been that it was not doing anything because it wanted to devise a special programme next year. Now we hear that the Commission does not intend to do anything about lesser-used languages. In this respect I am glad that this question is on today's agenda. I am sorry that some joker has taken the liberty of changing the title of the resolution. We are not talking about language diversity, we are talking about the lesser-used languages, which is why I am also rather sorry, Commissioner Nielson, that you chose not to honour a lesser-used language by speaking Danish. It is not a question of pride, it is a question of respect for the diversity of European languages, of which Danish is one. I am all for talking about it, I am all for talking more about it, I am all for the Commission's doing something about it. But I must say to you in all honesty that the text before us today has been thrown together, it is slapdash and flippant and I, for one, am not proud of it. I am sorry, but it has to be said. We could have done a much better job if we had had more time, which is why our group does not support all the proposed amendments. I think that Article 3 is better than Amendment No 4. Why should I agree to your proposed amendment when our article in the resolution is better than your proposed amendment? We mean the same thing. We just need less flippancy here. On another question, all of us here in the House – including me personally – are in favour of qualified majority voting on cultural affairs. But we should walk before we insist on running. We can only run once we have learned to walk, which is why we must keep a sense of reason and hope that Laeken prompts something in the convention to bring this about. Finally, I should like to say that we in the European People's Party are ready to suggest an own initiative report on lesser-used languages at the next meeting of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. This will allow all those who have spoken so fulsomely in favour today to put their money where their mouth is. I for one would be delighted if we dumped this resolution today because it is not as good as an own initiative report could be. I assume that the Socialists will want no part of it, so we shall see how it all turns out. But I should like to inform the House that we shall be putting in for a report. Please tell your fellow members to vote with us then next year.

 Mr President, Mr Lagendijk has produced a very good report. I would also like to thank Mr Färm sincerely and on behalf of my group, of which I seem to be the only representative here today, thank them both and in general terms agree with everything they have said. I would also like to highlight a couple of things. I think this rapid reaction facility, this way of getting money to crisis regions quickly, efficiently and without bureaucracy, really is a good instrument. In Yugoslavia in particular, as the Commissioner has seen, they were grateful for this really quick and efficient assistance that was only possible because we had this instrument and did not have to use the usual longwinded procedure. I also believe it really must be extended to Macedonia, because something simply must be done to help the difficult political processes. The process is far from being completed. Laws need to be implemented so that the Albanian citizens can see that they really have gained something from these constitutional changes. The region’s Macedonian inhabitants must see that if they behave as is expected in democracies, they will also be rewarded with an improvement in their everyday lives. We agree to everything, we also agree to the reservations Mr Färm has mentioned. But I think the Commission knows all this very well and I am sure it respects it. This brings me back again to the establishment of the agency in Macedonia. In view of the pathetic results of implementation and of spending the money earmarked for this country since 1996, I am of the opinion that it is high time we sought to remedy the situation. Of course, the Macedonian government lacked the will, and we who were down there know they were simply not in a position to do anything. Whether they were unable or unwilling I would not like to say now, but there was a lack of will on the part of the government, and, in the end, the delegation on the spot was unable to give the government the help it needed. The necessary technical assistance that the Commission should have given to this government was lacking. I think it is therefore good that the Commissioner has now thought about measures that can be taken to speed things up. It will be good for the agency, which is doing excellent work in Kosovo – I expect we shall see that in Belgrade next weekend. We want it to be possible for them finally to do what the Macedonians are all waiting for and I have nothing against it being used. However, Commissioner, my problem is that there is so much tinkering around going on now. Now it is being done in Macedonia. I do not know when you will be so effective again next time. I would very much like to see a structure for this work in the region, and I would like to hear from you this evening whether you are willing or able to produce a scheme that will either, deconcentrate the delegations and enable them to do this work, or that you intend to deploy such agencies in the whole region. I believe you owe us an answer on that this evening and I hope that this evening you will tell us how soon you, in the Commission, believe you can lay such a scheme before us. On this condition, I am prepared to give you my unreserved best wishes for setting up this agency because we have all had excellent experience. I do not want to criticise the delegation on the ground here. The delegation on the ground was not able to do what we expected of it because it was not deconcentrated, whatever that means, and it could not give the technical assistance. In that regard, I really am looking for a longer term scheme from you so that all the countries down there can feel they are being treated, more or less, equally and I think that is also important if we are to avoid creating rivalries between them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to heartily congratulate Mr Langen and will limit myself to just one aspect of a special public provision situation, that is, the cultural dimension in the audio-visual field, in other words public television and radio. I was in favour of the introduction of private-sector television from the very outset, as I still am, whilst being convinced, in the final analysis, that we must work on the assumption that a public-service broadcasting remit is necessary. Two particular aspects must be highlighted here: on the one hand the obligation to provide a service to all, that is, overall popular provision under appropriate conditions, and on the other the obligation to reflect the pluralistic nature of our society. The dual broadcasting system has proved itself. There would be no sense in constantly requiring the public broadcasters to justify every single programme. A balanced programme needs leeway. What is also certain is that we cannot allow taxes and licence fees to finance the creation of a public-service copy of the private-sector service providers. The public media need leeway, but also clarification of their role and standards for fulfilling it. It is in this respect that the communication from the Commission is particularly to be welcomed. It also needs to be made clear, however, that, in the case of services with social welfare in mind, the type of transmission – be it terrestrial or videostreaming – cannot be crucial. What matters are the objectives to be safeguarded, our democratic foundational principles, pluralism and free access to culture and to technological progress. We must of course guarantee the protection of the users, especially of the young. In terms of competition law, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, must restrict itself to watching out for misuse. It must continue to respect and defend the competence of Member States as regards the content of programmes. Regulatory authority must then remain with the Member States, and it is therefore incumbent on them too to determine financial and organisational structures. I welcome the fact the Commission and the Council are endeavouring to come to an arrangement with the Member States about this.

Mr President, I rise to speak in place of Ruth Hieronymi, who actually should have been speaking, but is unfortunately unwell. I am very glad to be able to do so, and congratulate the rapporteur. It is not that often that we have somebody speaking here who is as knowledgeable about his subject as is Mr Vander Taelen, who is a film-maker himself. So, well done, my dear Mr Vander Taelen. I think your report really does provide much needed impetus. As you said, the market share of European films in the cinemas of the European Union is at an historic low point of only 22.5%. The dominance of the American film industry is also reflected in the grossly excessive trade deficit of EUR 6.8 billion. The situation in the acceding countries is even more dramatic. There is another problem, apart from the clear dominance of films from the USA, which we must not draw a veil over. We often talk in this House of our desire to promote European films, but many are thinking only of their own national film industry and not of their neighbour's, whose films, European films, are not seen in neighbouring regions often enough. The Commission and the Council as well, must, as a matter of urgency, at last produce a plan to make the European film industry competitive. This is also a sector in which there is money to be made, as the Americans show us. Perhaps the powers-that-be will eventually wake up and do more here. The central deficits are in the distribution and marketing of our films and, of course, the industry is chronically undercapitalised. I am therefore very glad that we, Parliament, Commission and Council together, have, in the Media-Plus programme above all, got to grips with the twin areas of marketing and distribution and are endeavouring to give help. I am, of course, also glad that, at the Commissioner's suggestion, the European Investment Bank is also willing to do something about this by making risk capital available for the realisation of audiovisual projects. I believe, then, that we have given a lot of things a push in this area, but can do still more. I also find it a good thing that we are achieving tax breaks at the level of the Member States, and that we can do something to enable filmmakers from one country to get resources and help from another. That, then, is possible. I think this could also be used in the framework of the i2i initiative to promote investment in the infrastructure of independent cinemas, as we propose in this report. I believe that the extension of cinemas in economically weaker regions in the framework of the European Structural Fund can be helpful. There is a lot more that I could say. I am not entirely in agreement with item 7, in which the call is made for television broadcasters to be obliged to reserve a certain proportion of transmission time for foreign films. That, of course, meets with great resistance from the broadcasters. We will discuss that when examining the ‘Television without Frontiers’ directive and will perhaps find a way through. Again, congratulations!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the congratulations expressed by previous speakers and address just two points in Mr Brok's report. My first point concerns conflict prevention. The case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia provides us with an example of unsuccessful conflict prevention. If all of the Members of the Council had worked as intensively as Members of this Parliament have for years to put pressure on all Macedonian governments finally to put an end to the discrimination of the Albanian citizens of that country, then we would not be facing the difficulties and problems which we are now. If this issue had played a part in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement then the Members of the Council would also have seen it as a precondition and the terrorists from Kosovo would not have had any support for their campaign in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Macedonians would not now be under pressure of time to change their constitution almost because of the success of the terrorist campaign, because they would have already done so. So much for our failure to prevent conflict in this country! A second matter which is very important to me was addressed by Mr Brok. I think that the Stability Pact should finally mark the end of the conferences and quick start packages. The Stability Pact should be closely linked to the work of the Agency for Reconstruction and should perhaps be extended to the Agency for Reconstruction and Development in this region. For this reason, the Stability Pact should be incorporated in the Commission's remit; this is where all of the work has to be done in any case. We would then be able to avoid resources being wasted because of friction, we would be able to achieve synergies and we would be able to make progress on establishing real stability in the region. In this way, we would, for example, be able to foster significant and large-scale cooperation in the energy sector. We would be able to make progress on the free trade area in the region, on constructing transport infrastructure and on combating trafficking in human beings and other commodities. Many Commission officials will in any case very soon be unemployed because the enlargement negotiations in the Commission are as good as closed in some areas. Let us give these people something to work on. Let us hand over responsibility for the Stability Pact to those who can manage it and take it away from those who have in any case already begun to abandon it. Let us give the Stability Pact to the Commission and, perhaps, to one other wise man, Martti Ahtisaari, in addition, so that it really is a success for the entire region and for the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the weapons have been collected, so it is claimed. The NLA has been dissolved, so it claims. We all know that there are still a great many weapons in Macedonia, and the issue of a criminal association is still on the agenda. It includes those who want it. I still assume that most Albanians want it. I also assume that most Macedonians want it. However, the problem in many Slav Macedonian heads has not yet been resolved – otherwise, we would never have had the problem in the first place. In recent years, nothing was done to enable the Albanian minority – a substantial 28 percent of the population – to participate genuinely as citizens on an equal footing. If this issue had been addressed seven or eight years ago, instead of just two years ago, and if progressive measures had been taken to make all citizens equal, the rebels would not have had such an easy ride, in my view. It is a pity – also for the Macedonian people – that it now looks as if there is only a response when criminal elements appear to be overrunning the country. It is a pity, but it is the fault of all the political parties on the ground. Ultimately, we have now achieved what this House has always asked for. As Mr Swoboda has said, I would also like to remind you that we do not want a divided country. Macedonia is a state. It should continue to be a state, and it should not be divided along ethnic or national lines. Anyone who considers this option puts the entire region at risk. That is something which is extremely dangerous. I very much hope that this new Parliament will also now try to implement the laws as quickly as possible. The problem is that we are now hearing that what they have already voted for is being called into question again, and that sessions of parliament are constantly being postponed. Obviously, there are reasons for this. In Tetovo, for example, repeated attacks are being carried out on the Macedonian police. We must ask ourselves why this is happening. We must therefore be very diplomatic but firm with all our colleagues in Macedonia and ask them to make genuine efforts to progress with the Ohrid Agreement. We must not allow any recourse to this dreadful idea of holding a referendum in order to put off these constitutional changes indefinitely. That must not happen. Hannes Swoboda, Joost Lagendijk and I will try to bring influence to bear on our Macedonian colleagues over the next two days. I also think it is very important for an amnesty to be granted in whichever way is appropriate under the laws of the country, but this should not apply to crimes to be investigated in The Hague. I think we should make a fine distinction here. Naturally, I very much hope that the parliament will now put in place the laws necessary to strengthen local autonomy and give the minorities – which, after all, are majorities in some regions of the country – the opportunity to take genuine responsibility for their fellow citizens. I think that if they pursue this course, as Johannes has said, we will have peaceful situations by the end of this year.

Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to offer Mr Ruffolo my warmest thanks for taking the initiative because, without such an effort on his part, we would have no own initiative report and we would not be able to talk about it today or ask for funds from the budget. So my warmest thanks. The report was adopted with a broad consensus, it has come at the right time and it represents a political challenge for everyone involved in it. And I hope that means a lot of people at all levels. Setting up an observatory for cultural cooperation and the proposed three-year cultural cooperation plan will, in the final analysis, be a gauge of just how seriously politicians at all levels are trying to maintain and develop a European area of culture. I am also delighted that two points have been included which I addressed in my report on the status of artists in 1992, Mrs Echerer. I called at that time for greater support for patrons, including through greater tax incentives. I called then – as I do now – for a long overdue study to be drafted on the approximation of taxes on works of art and the work of artists. Because we have social cohesion and are citizens of Europe, we need a European cultural policy and our amazing diversity must be highlighted time and time again. Project Europe shed its economic and technical orientation a long time ago. We desperately need to draft a common cultural policy and common education policy if we are to rekindle the soul of Europe, which has been choked by economic expediency and covered in a thick layer of bureaucratic dust at all levels, regional, local, national and even European, for far too long. Our citizens today simply want more beautiful things. More beautiful things will reawaken their enthusiasm for Europe and more culture costs a bit more. So please let us add something to the budget now. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, we welcome Mr Léotard’s appointment and also Mr Badinter’s intervention in the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I believe that, in them, we have two representatives of the European Community who are in a position to do good there. Like Commissioner Patten, however, I should not like it to be forgotten that the EU Delegation on the spot has already been doing beneficial work for years and has constantly intervened. We need a permanent presence on the ground, not because we want a protectorate of some kind but because we want to demonstrate our interest in preserving the state of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. They need a mediator and I think that we have now identified him. However, I do not believe that we can disregard the fact that it might also be good for NATO to be seen to have a presence in Macedonia as a preventive measure. Neither does the fact that we now make our financial assistance conditional on there being a clear desire for peace on the ground mean that we are interfering in domestic matters, as this is described in the region. After all, we cannot indefinitely spend our taxpayers’ money in a country in which the desire for peace is not underpinned by joint initiatives to create that peace. We cannot, for example, build roads and infrastructure while government troops and rebels are buying weapons. I underline the fact that it was the KLA that brought conflict into the country; there is no doubt about that. Nevertheless, the government must not now give in to the KLA’s demands so as to avoid civil war; instead it must take account of the long-standing demands of the elected Albanians in Macedonia and seek solutions with them. In my opinion, however, the solution cannot be to divide the country along ethnic lines. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia belongs to all of its citizens and this must also be enshrined in the constitution. A right of veto, however well-meant, cannot be awarded to any section of the population; this causes division. The president of the country is the president of all the people of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and an Albanian vice-president with a right of veto would therefore be an unreasonable demand from the Albanian side. It must be possible for all citizens to use their mother tongue. The long-standing plan to decentralise power and strengthen the cities and local authorities must finally be executed. But decentralisation of the army and the police, which the Albanians are now calling for, cannot reinforce the country’s cohesion, quite the opposite. The desire for peace must be underpinned by moderate and justified demands. The European Union must foster reform and reconciliation in its vicinity, which means that we cannot stand idly by and watch while a civil war looms in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The KLA rebels were taken from Skopje to northern Macedonia with their weapons on air-conditioned buses. Can you imagine what kind of an image this gave of our involvement in the country? It did us serious damage and it falsely portrayed us as supporters of the Albanians. Macedonia makes it all too obvious to us that we finally need to force ourselves to develop an overall policy for the Balkans, because it is only as part of a joint strategy with Kosovo that it will be possible to resolve this problem.

 Madam President, I should simply like to add one more point: the striking thing about this situation was that one of the three people who caused the commotion here was the same person who attacked the Turkish Foreign Minister during a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I should like this to be recorded in the Minutes once again. I did say it yesterday to your representative. Surely it cannot be possible for an individual, who has been identified, not to be banned from entering this House! Why is there not a computer with an alarm signal stored in it by means of which a person of this kind is denied access? There must be no repeat of this! I would really ask you to ensure that these matters are investigated. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing an incident concerning a mosque. This mosque was not destroyed in any war. This mosque stood in Banja Luka, where there was no war. It was razed to the ground in 1993, its foundations were torn up, and a car park was built on the site. This mosque was destroyed – like hundreds of other Muslim and Catholic places of worship – on the orders of Karadzic and his henchmen. Not only were these places of worship destroyed; hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats were forced to flee their homes at a time when there was no war in this region, namely between 1991 and 1995. As Johannes Swoboda has already pointed out, the Dayton Agreement has now been in place since late 1995. We never liked this Agreement. It ended the war, but it has not yet brought peace to the region. Six years have now passed, and we have to recognise that Dayton contains few promises and has achieved even less. It has divided the country into two ethnic entities, a mono-ethnic Serb entity, and a Muslim-Croat entity. This situation has proved highly problematical in practice. In essence, we have created an artificial product. Do we really expect Bosnia's inexperienced politicians to cope with this state of affairs today? It is extremely difficult. What's more, we do not always help each entity equally. The numbers of people returning are still too low. Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled, and there are still half a million displaced persons in Bosnia who have not returned home. I think we must appeal to everyone to take action here. The Republika Srpska
 lags behind the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina with regard to refugee return, and this is obviously one reason for the situation which we witnessed ten days ago in Banja Luka. At the laying of the foundation stone of this ancient mosque, and eight days earlier at the laying of the foundation stone for another mosque in Trebinje, hardliners from the SDS, the Serb nationalists, were yet again able to drum up supporters who interrupted the ceremonies, set fire to buses, and threatened the lives of participants. The President of the Republika Srpska
 and his government and Prime Minister must make serious efforts to condemn this incident and create an atmosphere which fosters peaceful relations between the communities, which were the norm in this region until 1991. In my view, we should also have no qualms about coupling financial assistance with conditions at last. We made it quite clear to Milorad Dodik, the previous Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska
, that he could count on our financial support if he encouraged refugee return. We supported his work when he was in office, yet he did not allow any displaced persons to return. There is now a new government in office, and we really must proceed with caution. We are talking about taxpayers' money here, and we must be sure that it is used to achieve the goals set by the international community and the European Union. Refugees wishing to return must be able to do so. The same naturally applies to the neighbouring region of Croatia as well. In Croatia, there is a law preventing the restitution of property to Serb owners who fled from the region. Admittedly, many Serbs no longer want to return, but their property should at least be restored to them, and they should be given support to enable them to return to – or from – Croatia. We have addressed a number of other issues in our motion as well. In the Muslim-Croat Federation, hardline Croat separatists are also disrupting peaceful relations between the communities and trying to set up a breakaway mini-state in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They will never be successful. The moderates are stronger, and we must give them our support. However, given that the international community has a certain amount of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should not use it arbitrarily to amend an electoral law in a way which discriminates against a specific ethnic group. This simply reinforces the hardliners' cause and increases support for them. I realise that this step is now regretted, but it is important to address this issue so that it does not happen again. I hope that we will do everything possible within the scope of our CARDS programme to ensure that the refugees are able to return to all parts of the region. This is the best contribution we can make to promoting peaceful relations between the communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Applause)

 Commissioner Verheugen, thank you very much for your statement. Following on from your comments about all the problems faced in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I should just like to ask whether it is true that Bosnia-Herzegovina is scheduled to join the Council of Europe at that body's next or subsequent meeting. I should like to ask whether this really is true, and whether all 15 of our Member States can shake hands on it before all the conditions which you have described are fulfilled.

Mr President, could you please find out how these three people even got in here? We have such a strict security system, that we have trouble gaining admittance for our own citizens who come here with good intentions. These people could not have got in without being let in. The fact that the Communists stood up when they came in shows where they came from. Please look into this very carefully and check who signed the slip. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes active support for the peace process in Macedonia. For the very first time over recent months we have seen the Council and Commission starting to act in concert in the case of the former Yugoslavia; everyone has the same take on the situation and we have joint action as a result. We just have to bear in mind that we cannot turn our back on this country once the fighting abates and the shooting stops. On the contrary, we must monitor the situation continuously and closely, by which I mean on the ground. The European Parliament has acted consistently since 1993. We have constantly discussed all the problems with our Macedonian counterparts and the Macedonian government. We have called on them time and again not to underestimate the simmering ethnic conflict and to do everything to prevent such conflict from breaking out. For years little was done and that is a pity. If the truth be told, this problem was criminally neglected for years. But now this last government has got down to business over the last two and a half years and has done much to help the Albanian people and get things moving. And then, just when we have important ministers of Albanian origin with important portfolios, just when a real solution has been found to the question of Albanian education and the problem of Tetovo University, at that precise moment, hostilities break out. And we simply have to concede that they have been imported from outside. I am surprised that none of the previous speakers, from either the Council or the Commission, reminded us that these hostilities were imported from outside. That is why we now need to look at the situation outside the country. Elections were held in Kosovo last year. If elections had been held in Kosovo this spring, we would probably have been able to prevent this unrest in the neighbouring country. But we have no proof of that. Now we have a situation in which Mr Hekkerup, without talking to us here in Parliament – I do not know if he has spoken to the Commission, but he has certainly never spoken to us; we pay for the administration of UNMIK, we are the main payers, but no-one asks us what should be done down there – is designing a constitution which neither the Serbs nor the Albanians support 100%. It may well be a very good constitution. But if a constitution is announced in May and a vote is held on it in November, that gives seven months for the extremists to again find plenty of cause for unrest. It is just not on. You have to learn from your mistakes. Perhaps they should have asked their counterparts in the European Parliament. We could have told them. So I think that mistakes were made. We must just hope that the elections can still be brought forward. Now back to Macedonia. The visitors in the gallery will have noticed that it says "Situation ARYM" 
up there. In English it would be "Situation FYROM"
. This is none other than the country of Macedonia, whose neighbours are refusing it its name. It is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. FYROM and ARYM are in fact temporary aids and should soon be consigned to the dustbin of history. We welcome the formation of the all-party coalition and hope that it will succeed in moving towards ethnic cohabitation. We hope that none of the parties will pursue separatist or nationalistic agendas. So I think we are on the right course here. I take up the Council's suggestion. We shall try to take a delegation to Skopje before the summer.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am standing in today for Mr Gargani, who is staying in Italy for reasons you will understand. In this major debate on education we have added a question to the Commission and the Council – unfortunately the Council is unable to be present – because we believe that now, when everyone is suddenly talking about a European educational area, the European Parliament that has always talked about it and fought for it, but which has always been blocked by the Council of Ministers, cannot simply look on while it, the elected representative of the citizens, is bypassed in matters which are very important and which we have been advocating for a long time. I think it was indecent – perhaps that is too strong a word – improper to ask Parliament on 8 February for an opinion on the future objectives of general vocational training systems that was presented to the Council just four weeks later. Things cannot be allowed to continue that way! That is why we called for this debate and why we are asking to be properly included in the discussion in future. We are all of the opinion that this report on general vocational training in the European Union is a major step forward after the Lisbon Council because it sets concrete objectives and defines the future role of general vocational training. This is an issue that affects all Europe’s citizens. I repeat once again, this is something we have said all along. As Socrates rapporteur, I fought for this together with my colleagues, ultimately without success. If success is coming at this late stage, I am grateful. We must, however, always bear in mind that this is an area of policy that we cannot carry through without the support of the Member States. It involves matters that can be tackled only in the context of subsidiarity. We can give examples, we can make a synopsis of how things look in one country or another. Perhaps the Member States can learn from each other. There is no need to keep reinventing the wheel. We cannot, however, do very much more in these fields. We should like to stress that the open method of coordination that the European Council called into being at its Lisbon meeting and in whose context this report was prepared must not be allowed to prevent the institutions provided for in the Treaties from fulfilling their roles. In our opinion, the general consideration of the future role of general vocational training in the context of the open method of coordination must have regard not only for the contributions of the Member States, but also, and, above all, for the contributions of the European Parliament and the Commission, while safeguarding the principle of subsidiarity. We reiterate that the conclusions drawn by the Stockholm European Council and the strategic objectives that were formulated can form the basis for a working programme for the coming decade. These things cost money, however. I should like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot always confine ourselves to fine words, making grand final communiques
 and calling on the Commission to act. At the end of the day, we all stand there and say: I hear the words, but I have no faith in them because the money for all the things we want to do is not there. So I hope that the Heads of Government, having realised that education is tremendously important in the European Union, far more important than many still think, will spend more money on it. I should like to point out to the Commission and the Council that we insist that, in the spirit of inter-institutional cooperation between Council, Parliament and Commission, the European Parliament must be involved in producing the follow-up report and in all the measures arising out of it as part of the long-term working programme. I am sure that the Commissioner will do that. I only hope that this will be passed on to the Council and that it will likewise follow in Mrs Reding’s footsteps. I also hope that we can work together on the things laid down in this working programme.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make four points. Firstly, I should like to say that the ambitious goal Socrates has pursued for years, the creation of a European educational area, is now almost reality – and I hope it will soon be embodied in the texts. The Council, the Councils of Feira, Lisbon, Stockholm and now also of Nice, have stressed the importance and role of education and training in society and for the knowledge society. I should like to underline that today education and training are, first of all, the European Union’s most important political priorities; secondly, they are a political challenge and an economic challenge, because we all know that without education and training we cannot offer young people training places. Thirdly, they are an opportunity to further develop Europe’s linguistic and cultural heritage and give it European added value. The second point I want to address is that the Commission and Council really seem to be both maximalists and minimalists. Maximialists in the strategies and political ambitions they develop on paper. On the other hand, however, the European Union and, above all, the Council, is a very great minimalist when it comes to actually giving these great projects financial resources. Then it is always the Commission or Parliament or whoever that come in for criticism, but never the people who with great pomp and ceremony announce to the great councils how important training and education are. If they would provide the money for it the next day, we would all, especially our citizens, be very grateful. The European Union has, in fact, always been mean in the budgets for education. I should like to remind you all of the dreadful Conciliation Committee marathon over the little bit extra we wanted for Socrates. I hope that the revision of this Socrates programme that will probably take place within the next two years will also bring Socrates a little more money. I am pleased, and Parliament can be pleased, that there is now an e
-Learning initiative. We have heard, as Mr Costa Neves has said, that Parliament, represented by the Committee on Budgets, is pressing for this not to be at the expense of any existing programme. These programmes have their purpose! They have the financial resources for that and nothing else! I therefore believe that if we say that e
-Learning is important, and we stress that it is, then there must also be a programme with the proper financial resources. The third point is that I regret and deplore the fact that we were not sufficiently involved in the general matters; I said so earlier on Mr Gargani’s behalf. We really must be responsible for the system’s specific objectives, we must help to bring this about and inter-institutional cooperation must be ensured. I assume I am reflecting what you said, Commissioner, you understood it that way and you will include it in future. My fourth point is this: In view of the debate on enlargement and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, we need our work in this European Union to be genuinely visible, we need a European educational area that is visible to the citizen. This means it must be really accessible to the citizen himself, and the citizen needs to be permanently involved in these programmes through the representation of his MEPs. We need the directives, we need ambitious objectives, we need measures, we need action programmes, with their own funding, of course, and if we do all that in education, then we shall not need so many Commission and Parliament information campaigns any more because we shall have reached the citizen where he is. I hope we can go this way together.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could actually say that Johannes Swoboda has said it all. I could say exactly that. However, perhaps I can highlight some slightly different points. The speed with which we are acting is also due to the fact that we simply want to show that Parliament is backing this country, Macedonia, and we also want to help it to overcome the current crisis as quickly as possible. Of course we are also pleased that in Macedonia this House has totally subscribed to the European ideal and given its assent to this agreement. This demonstrates whom Parliament has decided in favour of. However, we must also make it clear in Macedonia that this Union is a Union of values. We do not always observe them all, but these values include a high level of tolerance, a high level of respect for others and a great commitment to protecting minorities. That is why I believe that in Macedonia it is necessary to work together, across party political lines, taking account of this tolerance threshold. We need to fight together against criminality. I deeply regret, in particular, the death of four Macedonian soldiers in the last few days. So we need to fight together against criminals and agitators. Everyone should distance themselves from these actions and condemn them, work towards a climate of tolerance, and do everything to promote it, in all the media as well as in the Macedonian Parliament and in Macedonian society. Albanian terrorism must be condemned, but Slav-Macedonian nationalism is not an appropriate response to it. I think Johannes Swoboda said that too, but perhaps he did not say it as emphatically as I have done. Reason must make its entry on the Macedonian stage and that is why I believe it is the duty of all politicians to sweep aside any grounds for such actions, be they perceived or genuine. It is true that the Albanian population is nowhere near having had appropriate access to public office and has not had a public presence which would enable it, with justification, to reject any attack on the fragile inter-ethnic balance. This is partly a legacy of the communist past, but it is also partly attributable to the fact that in recent years insufficient efforts have been made to enhance this inter-ethnic balance. In my conversations with former President Kligorov he repeatedly told me that he recognised this and was seeking to take action. I must also say, however, that the former government did not necessarily pay sufficient heed to these appeals. So it is all the more incomprehensible that after the admirable way the Kosovo crisis was handled, when the entire Macedonian people, both Slavic Macedonians and Albanians, genuinely accepted the refugees in a truly commendable way, that just at this moment when Albanians are occupying key ministerial posts, when the law on higher education has been passed, when the fate of the University of Tetovo has been resolved with assistance from us and with the help of other states through additional funding, and the academic year can actually start, that just at this moment an explosive situation should arise. I believe that this is happening not so much for genuine political and rational reasons, but rather to keep a real trouble spot alive so that terrorists can strengthen their hand. I very much hope that all reasonable politicians in Macedonia will, in view of the new European window of opportunity opened up by this agreement, jointly launch yet more initiatives to achieve a functioning Macedonian society. But I would also like to appeal to the international community, to UNMIK and to KFOR, to do everything possible to help Macedonia by pursuing a better and more consistent policy in Kosovo, because the dissatisfaction there is releasing ever more terrorist potential. There are many areas of policy in Macedonia where assistance is needed. We should help them in the field of criminal jurisdiction, with their problems of corruption and also of trafficking in human beings, which is also a major problem throughout the region. I particularly welcome the fact that the border agreement with Yugoslavia was the first to be concluded in the region. I would also, amongst other things, like to see media representatives being trained so that they are worthy of that name and do not unnecessarily pour oil on the fire. I would also like to see the politicians who are here today and their colleagues doing everything in their power to ensure that their youth can in future stay in their country, because it is their future. But they need jobs and they need prospects. That is why we very much welcome the fact that the five regional Enterprise Promotion Centres 
have been set up, and I hope they will be a success. The most important thing, however, is political stability, because only if that exists will companies move there. Under our new agreement, it will be possible for the European Union to provide them with the necessary support. I am sure that in conjunction with the Commission we will do everything to achieve this.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was good that Dr Trajkovski, the President of Macedonia, was in Stockholm. He is a man who has made an all-out commitment to interethnic coexistence. However, if you look closely at the situation in Macedonia, you cannot but conclude that the root cause of the extremist incidents lies not so much in Macedonia as in the hesitant action of the West in Kosovo. The fact of the matter is that the minority rules in Macedonia for the Walachians, Serbs, Romas and Turks are exemplary and many countries in the region would do well to follow its example. Secondly: the Albanian minority of around 28% naturally needs special treatment. They have 4 ministers in key positions in this government. What the previous government unfortunately failed to take into account was the question of higher education for these people and the need to resolve the problem of Tetovo University. This government made a start on all this, despite the Kosovo crisis, and just as it did so, along came extremists from outside and upset everything. I call on the Council to help this government to continue on its chosen path and to call on the opposition in Macedonia to support it. And I call on the Member States to send money to Tetovo University so that it can start the academic year. As far as Kosovo is concerned, I urgently call for the borders with Serbia and Macedonia to be closed to extremists. We can probably do this with the help called for. But UNMIC must get elections under way in Kosovo at long last, so that elected Albanian politicians can take their fate in their own hands and put the extremists in their place. Governments in the west must realise that problems need to be monitored closely and a solution found. If we keep stopping half way, we just give the extremists room to manoeuvre.

 Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, for being here today. We are, of course, all pleased that a compromise has finally been reached, and I have, in fact, always agreed with you that the Commission clearly does not want to destroy football. I got a few bloody noses at home for supporting you to such an extent, but by now I think that even the rather rude Mr Beckenbauer will have recognised that you are not trying to destroy his beloved football. That is why I am pleased about the compromise, but I would like to ask you one thing now. Putting to one side for the time being those who for a wide variety of reasons will gain from this compromise – young sportsmen and women, small sports clubs, large sports clubs – are you not worried that this compromise, which treats sportsmen and women up to the age of 28 differently from those older than that, could lead to a violation of the principle of equality? Are you not worried that in the end there will be even more Bosman judgments, by which I mean that courts exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction may take a different view to that represented by this compromise? Are you not concerned that this could lead to us being buried in a veritable avalanche of court cases?

 Mr President, Commissioner, you had a rather thankless task, my dear Mr Monti. I cannot imagine that you felt very comfortable this evening, because I should like to say to you that, although I hear your words, I cannot believe them. That is the problem. For months now, we have been waiting for something which will now – as you have again indicated today – perhaps be available in the summer, God – or whoever is going to do the work you mentioned – willing. I mean, if you take a dossier away from one area of an organisation then you must surely know where you are going to reallocate it. This portfolio has been taken away from people who have actually been doing a fairly good job over the last few months and years. During the course of the project they learnt more about it. Now it has been put on someone else's desk and is in limbo. This is a dreadful state of affairs. It is like a poor orphan. No one really cares about it; no one is really responsible for it. That is why I actually think that what sounded good in theory has not yet developed into anything worthwhile in practice. We have already been waiting for the communication for ages, and I am eager to know when it will be forthcoming. Over and above what is, of course, also in our written contributions, I should like to suggest to the Commission that it, perhaps, does not need to create so very much that is new; instead it should concentrate much more on harnessing those who are doing fantastic work on the spot. They do exist. There are networks which work incredibly well and it should use them. When I consider that you praise the Info-Points here! Well, I know of an Info-Point which is doing a great job, but which cannot survive on the money from the European Commission, which never arrives until the end of the year or the following year. Today they do not know whether they will still exist next year. How are people supposed to work there and be motivated to motivate others? In my view there is much more to be done in this field. Of course, we all of us want to act in concert and to achieve the best results together but this will only work with decentralisation. You said it yourself. So let us not reinvent the wheel, but let us deploy all those who really are able to convey the concept of Europe with local colour, and not only the bit of Europe that is in Brussels! (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my good friend Olivier Dupuis spoke on quite the wrong subject. We are speaking today about southern Serbia and Kosovo. We are not discussing Serbia and current policy in Serbia proper. I agree with much of what you said, Olivier. Believe me, those Members who were in Belgrade have taken a clear line on the conditions. For us, there can be no money unless the conditions are fulfilled. No one has ever disputed that, apart from Commission President Prodi, whom I hereby urge to desist from such comments. But let me come back to today’s debate. It is a matter of how things stand now in Kosovo. I agree with Mr Lagendijk on this point. Unless we know quite soon what is to happen next in Kosovo, the difficulties will simply accumulate down there. The problem is that KFOR troops have become the targets of Serbian and Albanian attacks, although KFOR is actually there to protect both of these ethnic groups. The problem, in a nutshell, is that Mr Hækkerup will have to call elections very soon. To do that, he must know what powers the elected bodies will have. But we need these bodies so that the Serbian side has Kosovar negotiating partners. Now we have the subject of southern Serbia. I believe that KFOR, like other bodies, has not done all it should have done there. Where have the weapons come from for these new extremists? They have, of course, been transferred from the old KLA to the new KLA. In my view, KFOR, with its 50 000-strong force in Kosovo, ought to be able to establish order in the Presevo Valley. I appeal to KFOR to do so, lest we lose our credibility in that corner of the Balkans. I also believe, of course, in the truth of what the Mayor of Presevo said in Belgrade, namely that the population of Kosovo would like to remain in Serbia if only the Albanians in the region could be treated at long last on a par with the Serbs. They want to be part of everything that Yugoslav citizenship implies. I believe the government’s new plan is good. It is pursuing the right path, and we should support it. To tell the truth, I am a little saddened that Mr Kostuníca has said it will all happen without supervision by the EU. Why should we not play a part? We are good mediators. We can help the Serbs and Albanians to live together in peace, and I hope we shall be allowed to help them.

Mr President, we welcomed the installation, or election, of Vojislav Kostunica as the new President of Yugoslavia. We very soon had him here before the House, as you all know, and we have naturally become aware, as he too is aware, of the dreadful legacy he has inherited, of the economic situation confronting Yugoslavia, and we hope, of course, that he will be able to surmount all these difficulties with our help. But there is another point to be made: we must judge Yugoslavia by the same standards that we have applied to its neighbours and that we shall continue to apply to them. That is why we simply must ensure that the problems arising there are not simply settled with a nod and a wink or put on the back burner for possible consideration in the distant future but are resolved in an appropriate manner as soon as possible. There are still political prisoners in Serbia today; they are actually the prisoners of Slobodan Milosevic. There is surely no reason at all why Milosevic's political prisoners of yesterday should be Kostunica's prisoners today. Sadly, Mr Kostunica missed his opportunity, on becoming President, to free these political prisoners – the Albanians in particular, but the Serbs too. He let the opportunity slip, but at least the Albanian political prisoners from Kosovo could have been released if he had handed them over to UNMIK in Kosovo. In that way he would have been able to comply with Resolution 1244 and release them from Serbian prisons, and Dr Kouchner and his people would have had to take care of them. Now President Kostunica has tabled an amnesty law, but our House is not the only place where legislation takes time, and while the legislative wheels are turning down there, hundreds of young people – innocent young people – remain in custody. We expect this problem to be solved quickly. We also expect joint efforts to be made so that the many missing persons – Serbs and Albanians from Serbia and Kosovo – can soon be found; whether they are dead or alive, people want to know what has happened to them. That is the second problem. And the last problem to which I wish to refer relates to the dreadful occurrences at the border between Serbia and Kosovo. The fact is that we have a confrontation there between two adversaries, neither of whom has any desire for peace. On the one side there is the Albanian UCK reserve, and on the other there is Slobodan Milosevic's secret service. Neither side wants peace, but we must help to ensure that peace is established in that region. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome the start of the negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which will at last open up the prospect that country deserves. Unlike its neighbour Slovenia, immediately after independence in 1991 Croatia was not able to develop in a way as to allow it to become a candidate for accession at this point. For at the time, in 1991, one third of the country was occupied. At the time the Croats were driven out. In 1991/92 more than 250 000 Croats were expelled from Kraijina, from western and eastern Slavonia. They were not able to return to their homes until the, to my mind, justified­ recapture of these areas. There they found their property and possessions in ruins. Unfortunately, during this recapture Serbs who had the right to live there were expelled in return, not just by the Croats but sadly also by their Serb ringleaders, who, of course, did the same in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, we also saw serious attacks carried out during this recapture. But we should not confuse cause and effect. We then punished Croatia for this recapture by denying it our friendship. We refused to grant it any aid. And because we refused to help, many things then started to go wrong in Croatia, with wrongful privatisation, corruption and so on. The new government has now taken a European line in many policy areas. It is seeking to cooperate with The Hague. It has stopped supporting separatist movements in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is currently adopting difficult austerity measures in order to meet the preconditions. So I believe Croatia has deserved this support. It can become a factor of stability throughout the region.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Lagendijkand Westendorp reports on the Agency and the CARDS programme – it is difficult to distinguish one from the other – base their proposed amendments on the experience gained from their forerunners, the OBNOVA programme and the Kosovo agency. I think we all realise that a slimmer, more efficient structure is needed if the good work which the Kosovo Agency has carried out in recent months is to be consolidated for future purposes. In future, responsibility must be vested in a few people, including a director, if you like, so that really one person is responsible vis-à-vis the committee which selects the individual programmes. I think responsibility must be vested in very few people if we are to raise the profile of European work on the ground. As we have seen in Bosnia time and again, the Americans manage to show themselves to good advantage with very limited funds. In numerous areas, we have spent and continue to spend more money than anyone else but still we are not visible because it sort of runs through our fingers rather than being vested in any one institution. I also feel that duplicate work by the governing board and management board and unnecessary ritual meetings of their members, where it is the director responsible who needs to take the necessary decisions on time, should be avoided. I hope that Parliament's proposals will be accepted by the Commission and the Council. I repeat: unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really should be cut back. The money is desperately needed on the ground, where it can be put to better use. If, although this was not the case with my report on the Kosovo Agency, the Council could perhaps at last learn from its mistakes, that would help the taxpayer no end. The objectives of the CARDS programme were in fact all right. But something important, one important objective is missing from this CARDS and that is support for education and training in these countries. Without education and training there is nothing, which is why I am delighted that the members of all the committees have helped me to table this proposed amendment. As I understand it, the Commissioner also takes the view that this should be an important objective in the CARDS programme. It should also be an objective which is close the Council's heart. I really do hope that the French Minister for Education, Jacques Lang, will be able to persuade his cabinet to ensure that the French government does not oppose the inclusion of the objective of education in the CARDS programme in the next Coreper. I think it would be counterproductive and I am certain that Mr Lang will do his utmost and if Mr Moscovici were here, he would perhaps do so too. So my thanks to all my fellow members who see this as an important objective and I am delighted that we shall be able to bring these countries more in the way of content in the future. (Applause)

Unfortunately, Mr Moscovici was not here when I spoke. I should like him to tell me if he supports the addition of another objective to the objectives listed in the CARDS programme, namely support for education and training in south-east Europe. This is an important new objective in the CARDS programme. The Commission is in favour and I should like very much to know if the Council is too.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I really must express my surprise that the Commission has allowed a high-level Council working group to do the work that it should, in fact, have done after Amsterdam. I think that this is a shame, although what the group has done is not wrong because it touches on the right problems and also tries to point out the right possible solutions. As Mrs Karamanou has already said, since the opening of the Iron Curtain, which was of course drawn particularly tightly around Albania, it has been one of the most significant countries of origin and transit for immigrants entering the EU. Obviously this creates problems. However, we also have another problem in Albania. A considerable number of Albanians are leaving their homeland because of the instability in their country, because of the social difficulties and because of the pre-modern structures of society and family. They are leaving their country, and as they do so a part of the future of this country is lost. We need to help to establish a situation in this country which will induce people to stay there, to ensure that security is guaranteed, that there are jobs there and that the people simply do not look for a way out. Of course, we also need to prevent Albania from becoming more and more of a trade centre for refugees, drugs and trafficking in women. It is a country in which many are involved, in which many neighbours also get their hands dirty. That is why we need to help this country. We will do so as the European Union. We will train the police. We will help them with customs, but the problem is that so much is in a mess in this country that obviously progress is only very slow, despite some efforts being made by the government. I should like to say just one thing, Mrs Karamanou: if Albania is not a safe country of origin and we treat Albanian refugees differently from others, then neither can Albania claim that it wants to enter into a stability and association agreement with us. It has not yet come that far, but I think that it has come further than you suggest. For me, Albania is a country to which we can send people back. People are not persecuted there. All is not yet rosy either, but it is better than you have described

 Mr President, Commissioner, I am grateful for your comments, and support everything you have said. I would have said it in a similar way, except that I express myself differently. I had the same experience when I was in Serbia a fortnight ago with Mr Swoboda. Although we were not there before Mr Hombach, we did go there, because we have the funds to help people there. Mr Hombach only went there to make his presence felt and to establish what it might be possible to do. We know what can be done and we are in a position to make the funding available tomorrow, which I am very pleased about. I am also sure that under your auspices, Commissioner, emergency aid really will be provided swiftly. This is an opportunity for the Commission to demonstrate that it does not deserve its reputation. I have two questions. First, Mr Modrow alleged yesterday evening that everything we are doing there amounts to reparation for the NATO bombing. I told him that was nonsense. 90% of the damage that we are making good there is the result of socialist and communist mismanagement. I would be grateful if you would confirm this point. Secondly, when we were down there two weeks ago, we were told that the sanctions were being lifted, but they have not been lifted. Where do things stand on trade sanctions? Have you resolved that issue? Companies need to be able to do business now. You can put Milosevic's entourage on a blacklist, but you should open things up for everyone else!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I only want to express an opinion on a part of this Budget, namely that relating to Serbia. The elections in Yugoslavia have shown two things: that the people have finally had enough of the dictator Milosevic and that they have confidence in Professor Kostunica. The challenge faced by the new President is, at the same time, a challenge to us Europeans. The process of democratisation has only just begun. The retreat of the old Serbian government and the formation of a transitional cabinet of experts, as well as the election of the new Serbian parliament on 23 December of this year, are important prerequisites for replacing the old socialist-communist nomenclature in the Republic of Serbia, just as it has already been replaced in Montenegro, and for opening the door to democratic changes. Important institutional decisions have already been made in the last ten days. The independence of the Yugoslav national bank has been secured. The customs administration has finally ceased to be an instrument of corruption. It is now also important that the trade sanctions should be lifted by the EU as quickly as possible. Commissioner Patten, who is in Belgrade today, ought to endorse the proposal made by those who exercise responsibility in that country, to the effect that all trade sanctions should be lifted and that firms associated with war criminals should be blacklisted. In order to safeguard the success of the democratic forces in the elections, as well as Kostunica’s initial successes, we must do something. The Yugoslav economy is completely ruined. Our fellow MEP, Mr Modrow is no longer here, but he should be listening. The economy has, in the very first place, been ruined because of incredible mismanagement on the part of Milosevic and his wife Markovic, who was, and is, also chairman of the Communist Party and to all intents and purposes the head of a large mafia. In the second place, it has been ruined by the sanctions imposed upon the country because of Milosevic and, to a small degree, by the NATO bombings. It is incredible that a country which formerly exported food can now no longer feed its people. Winter is coming, and there is a shortage of gas, oil and heating equipment. The fact that, following Kostunica’s election, the Serbian parliament immediately lifted the restrictions upon prices which had until then been frozen, led to a price explosion, which might cause people to misunderstand the policy pursued by Kostunica who, however, had no influence at all upon this decision. Political stability depends upon the improvement of living conditions. To put it simply: the people of Serbia ought neither to freeze nor to go hungry this winter. That is why I most particularly welcome the fact that our fellow MEPs from the Committee on Budgets have made every effort to provide the emergency aid of EUR 200 million for this year, Mr Modrow, and not for next year, there still being two and a half months of this year left. With these funds, we could show that Europe is the real partner in this region. The latest elections contributed a further 80 municipalities to our democratic contacts at local level, so that we have a sufficient number of intermediaries at this level too. Those responsible for politics and the economy in Serbia emphasise again and again that they do not wish to become dependent upon our help, but that they need our help now in order to alleviate need in the short term and that they will then need help to help themselves introduce a social market economy in the medium and long term and in order also to make necessary foreign investment possible. I was very pleased today to hear Professor Kostunica officially acknowledge as crimes his predecessor’s actions against the Albanians and accept responsibility for these. I am sure that the Albanian political prisoners will also be released soon. Professor Kostunica deserves our support. I am also sure that this Parliament will concur with this judgement of mine when he has spoken before us in this Chamber on 15 November. The fact that it has today, at the same time, been decided to give EUR 175 million to poverty-stricken Kosovo shows that we do not forget the old challenges when new ones arise. I very much hope that in the debate on the CARDS programme, which of course covers our financial commitment to all these countries, we show the same level of commitment and give each country its due. If south-eastern Europe is to be a stable region, then individual States need to be stable, too.

Mr President, I would like to take up what Mr Dupuis had to say. I believe that when the audience in the stands sees ARYM up there, they will actually think this refers to a different country. ARYM means Ancienne République Yougoslave de Macédoine, 
i.e the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Quite simply, that means ‘Macedonia’. The dispute about the name is a dispute between Greece and the country of Macedonia. Of course we all hope – and that includes the Greek MEPs here – that this dispute will soon be settled. We have seen how the difficult situation in Macedonia has steadily worsened where the treatment of the Albanians is concerned. All of those who, for a long time now, have been going in and out of this country, have kept up the pressure for this problem to be resolved. However, I would also stress that this problem is nothing new: it is the legacy of the Yugoslav period, when the Albanians were always discriminated against, including those in Macedonia. Unfortunately, it was, of course, the case that the problem was not resolved under the last government, in the run-up to 1998. Therefore, we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education. The illegal foundation of Tetovo university many years ago produced great tension in Macedonia, which I am sorry to say, could not be defused over the past few years. We owe a duty of care to the students to ensure that this problem is resolved. After all, these students had, or have, diplomas that serve no purpose in the outside world. Therefore, I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem, and have now paved the way to this end. As a delegation, we have always insisted that a solution should be found to this problem. Now at last we have found it. Not us, but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski, and also the Albanian leader, Xhaferi, and above all, the representative of the Council of Europe, Max van der Stoel. This outstanding cooperation has led to a draft bill, which was adopted by the majority in Parliament. In common with Olivier Dupuis, I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition parties – which formed part of the government up until 1998 and could have resolved the problem – have closed their minds to this draft bill without offering a better solution themselves. I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, which has deliberately closed its mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia. The fact that the Socialist opposition refused to support this must have been against their better judgement, but that sometimes happens with the opposition, and not just in Macedonia. We are now awaiting the necessary aid for the transformation of Tetovo university into a private university whose diplomas will then be recognised. All those who want to see an improvement in the inter-ethnic relations in Macedonia, in the interests of stabilisation, must now do their bit to help solve this problem and ensure that a private university actually becomes a reality. That is what this urgent procedure is all about today. People from different ethnic backgrounds must be able to live together in Macedonia. This could provide a good role model for the neighbouring countries and help to stabilise the entire region.

Madam President, fellow Members. It is of course difficult, as events unfold in Belgrade, to sit here calmly and give a speech which was prepared before all this came to pass. I expected today’s events to take place last Monday. We all know that the people have stormed Parliament, that the television station, which has been fully occupied by the army, has been stormed and that army vehicles and the police are now out in force in the middle of Belgrade. We can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police – all of whom are essentially there to serve the people, not a dictator such as Milosevic – will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators. (Applause)
 Since democracy raised its head again in Serbia last Monday, the possibility of Serbia soon rejoining the European family is now a real possibility. The results of the elections on 24 September have made a democratic change of direction possible. I should like to congratulate everyone who helped to achieve it: the democratic opposition and, most importantly, the people and the leader of the democratic organisation, Mr Kostunica. I think that, in him, we have a man who understands both the Serbs and our concerns and with whom we can discuss a qualified procedure for bringing Serbia closer to Europe. Since 24 September, Milosevic can no longer claim to be an elected ruler. Everyone, including his own citizens in Serbia now clearly see that he is a dictator, who is using all the brutal, ugly and contemptuous instruments of dictatorship in his own country. Special police units, dirty tricks and deception, quasi-legal procedures which he is using in a bid to hush up the fact that the people are sick and tired of him. He has managed for years, with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media, to deceive the people in his own country and, unfortunately, many in the western world, to whom he has misrepresented the real situation. At last, all that is at an end. The people in Serbia have expressed their will in democratic elections and they are painfully aware of the fact that Milosevic has no intention of respecting this will and is thinking only of hanging on to power and maintaining his contemptuous regime. Which is why we must support Serbia in its bid for freedom. Those who have fought for peace in south-eastern Europe for years now and who are familiar with the situation in the region, know how difficult the fight against authoritarian rulers and tyrants in most of these countries was and, in places, still is. Sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect them to follow our views and our way of thinking, which do not fit in with their traditions and which are irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset. I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contacts in Serbia, who may well not understand us immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand us, partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural differences which I have mentioned. I should like straight away to warn against interpreting any such initial difficulties in communicating with the newly elected president as a sign of irreconcilable differences between us and the advocates of democracy in Serbia. There are no such differences. We can help them on the path to Europe. If we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in Serbia and push the so-called quick start packages through at long last, then we must do more than just talk. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanctions, because these sanctions have made 200 000 people in Serbia richer and richer and 10 million people poorer and poorer. Please help us to give the people a glimmer of hope, with Kostunica, so that we can all nurse some hope for Serbia. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a report that gave rise to much controversy when it was discussed in our committee, all sparked off by the term subsidiarity. But at a time when we not only have a surplus of audiovisual offerings but also excess consumption of these offerings, we cannot retreat behind the word subsidiarity. As politicians, we simply have a responsibility, in all the areas in which we act, to protect young people from that surplus. At a time when we are witnessing so much violence, hatred and intolerance in all our countries, we surely have to ask ourselves where it is coming from. Now, I cannot say: it all comes from television. But no doubt much of it can be traced back to the excessive consumption of these television offerings, some of which incite to hatred and intolerance, including intolerance towards other nationalities. So we must give serious thought to how we can check this. We have a responsibility towards minors! Subsidiarity is to be welcomed. And we want to preserve it; but I beg you, let us not hide behind it. It is our job to do something, and indeed we have already tried to introduce this kind of protection of minors with our first “Television without frontiers” directive. I am thinking now of Mr Hoppenstedt, who fought for the V chip. But what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier? Not much; children usually know how to handle it better than adults, which means we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation. We do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level, but we do want to introduce common criteria and minimum requirements at Community level and propose rules that help people effectively to implement measures to protect minors in their country. Of course I also think that we are not in a position, either as politicians or as technicians, to tackle this problem on our own. Far more important than all this, of course, is the role of the teachers and the parents, and handling this medium correctly. Television and the Internet have to be learned and, of course, also taught. So what we are doing today is just a small part of the job that society as a whole has to perform. I believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones. That is why we should do both, do our job as politicians and urge society to do its bit. Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the Liberals’ demands. I find them too liberal and not really geared to the interests of the minorities we are considering here.

Mr President, in my committee, very few things are subject to Community law. In other words, a great many issues are based on subsidiarity, and that is how it should stay. Accordingly, we have confined ourselves to a handful of issues and I only intend to pick out two particular aspects. The audiovisual sector is very important. We have established that the candidate countries have simply not made enough effort on the legislative front, and the legal provisions governing the audiovisual media fall a long way short of meeting the requirements of the acquis communautaire
. That was my first point. My second point is that there has also been precious little effort made to approximate the legal provisions on the intellectual property front, i.e. with regard to copyright. We have also addressed the issue of minorities, because the integration of these minorities – including their linguistic integration – in these countries, is also of significance. We have included a number of comments concerning the Russians in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and concerning the Roma in the other countries. Criticism and questions aside though, I would also like to highlight a positive development. In fact we have some positive feedback for you on the educational and cultural front. For years now, we have had links with these countries through the Tempus programme, and likewise, for a year and a half now, they have been entitled to participate fully in the educational, cultural and exchange programmes for young people. I believe we have been truly successful in building bridges here. We must not concentrate on economic matters alone, for it is in the very areas I have mentioned that we must find common ground and build on it. Indeed it is already there. I would like to make the honourable members aware of how unsatisfactory it is that the exchange under the Socrates programme always involves people from Eastern Europe visiting Western Europe, and that we must encourage our young people to visit the countries of Central and Eastern Europe instead. Only then will we truly find common ground in Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have three closely connected items on our agenda today. But the problem is that media interest will focus not so much on the Mennea and Zabell reports as on the Commissioner's announcement. I think that is a pity. We are now more worried about the apple of Germany's eye, football, than about what is really at stake today. I have no hesitation in supporting the two Commissioners whose task it is to implement the Bosman judgment. If FIFA had done its job, the Commission would not have needed to get involved in this. I hope that FIFA recognises that and will now finally come up with something that the Commission can include in its proposals, as long as they do not run counter to the Bosman judgment. So I think that everyone has a job to do here. As regards the reports, I would like to say that, in view of the big business sport has become, the social and educational importance of popular sport needs to be highlighted. There is a danger that sport as a whole will sooner or later be badly hit by rules on competition. We would like to prevent that, which is why the Mennea report quite rightly calls for a reference to sport in Article 151 of the Treaty as an aspect of culture. I, myself, called for this in my report back in 1996. That resulted in a declaration at Amsterdam, which was by no means enough. That is why I am supporting the fact that this is finally being introduced now. That report also called for the Commission to declare a European Year of Sport. A European Year of Sport would be an important stimulus, and I hope that the new Commissioner will now take this up. I am delighted that Mrs Zabell has covered some broader ground in her report on doping and that she has also stressed the abuse of young sportsmen and women, and has given an impetus to jointly tackling doping. I would like to congratulate the Commission on having joined this Anti-Doping Agency now, so that it can genuinely give an impetus to a harmonised approach towards combating doping on behalf of the Community of Fifteen. I wish it every luck.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a very important report here today. I should like to begin by saying that this is an exceptionally good maiden report by our new colleague Mrs Hieronymi, who also did a truly first-class job in hammering out compromises in committee with our Socialist colleagues and with the Greens and Liberals. So I believe we have cooperated well, even with the representatives of the European United Left. Together with the Commission, we have also managed to make a good Commission proposal even better. We do, of course, have a good general idea of what MEDIA I and MEDIA II have achieved. MEDIA Plus, of course, will surely be even better – the mere addition of the word 'Plus' must tell us that. I believe that, at a time when we have been talking about tremendously important educational issues in both Lisbon and Feira, we cannot make cuts in areas in which the products of the education system are supposed to find work. That is why I consider it very important that we really do create opportunities in this field, and to that end we must invest more money in the audiovisual industry, especially in the training of professionals. What is on offer here is therefore insufficient. This is always the case; there is never enough money for culture or for education. But at the end of the day we shall always be answerable to those people to whom we have promised the earth in our fine speeches. What we find here is not enough to enable us to respond to the audiovisual revolution. It will not enable us to develop a genuine European audiovisual policy to challenge the American hegemony in this domain. Nor can it really serve to unlock the full potential of the audiovisual industry to create jobs and, of course, to produce a critical mass of cultural content. I believe we have a duty to keep emphasising this fact. To put it bluntly, a European audiovisual policy has yet to materialise. That is why we must make an all-out effort here. I believe that, as Mrs Hieronymi has said, we could impart a considerable amount of momentum with a little more money. In the sphere of communications in particular, we can make a great deal of progress, including the creation of new jobs. At the same time, I should like to reemphasise that the primary concern of every one of us is of course European culture in all its diversity, as is the need to make it visible beyond our national borders and to portray it universally.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is almost midnight already, and I do not wish to extend this sitting unnecessarily. I agree with what Mrs Roure and Mr Perry have said and, of course, with the content of Mrs Sanders- Ten Holte's report. I should like to confine myself to a couple of points, and I shall begin by referring back to Feira and Lisbon. This report is really a follow-up to the thoughts of the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira. When we contemplate the information society and globalisation, when we consider the speed at which technology is changing our society, it becomes obvious that we must guarantee a school education that enables young people to stay abreast of these developments. We must create the basis for the essential establishment of lifelong learning. For that reason, I approve of the measures that are proposed here. They will probably help us to deal more effectively with this challenge. Let me just come back to a point that I raised myself in an amendment. It must be possible to work with the existing resources, with the available networks and databases. There is no need for us to keep reinventing the wheel. We should use what we have, comparing the knowledge we each possess and then operating on the basis of that knowledge.  I shall move on now to a technical point. In recent days we have heard that Mrs Sanders has been trying to make the first reading suffice. But of course there is a price to pay for that. Whoever wants to shorten the legislative process to one reading by making use of the scope for interinstitutional agreements has to conclude a deal. This deal does not involve a decree from the gentlemen of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, who have no say; they must simply declare their acceptance of the sound parliamentary proposals. They have not made such a declaration; they did promise us something, but we set no store by promises. We shall vote on our report tomorrow. Thereafter, if the gentlemen of Coreper feel able to accept our amendments, we are prepared to expedite the matter very swiftly in the autumn – there is no rush. We should not buy a pig in a poke; we should vote on our report tomorrow and give these gentlemen the opportunity to think again.

 Madam President, the trouble with this pass is that nobody knows about it! We make virtually no use of it at all. That is why I think you should remind the authorities once again that this pass is valid within the EU. Yesterday, Mrs Karamanou said that she wanted to travel to America on it, which is of course impossible. It clearly states in the pass that it is only valid within the European Union. But to prevent this sort of thing reoccurring, perhaps the German authorities, and also of the authorities in other countries, should be made aware of its validity.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just had a chance to speak with some young lawyers from Serbia, who gave us an impressive account of the hopeless situation in their country. So I am glad to come back to today’s subject, the complete lack of press freedom and access to information there. 
The population only gets information from the subjective viewpoint of Mr Milosevic and his wife Mrs Markovic. Anyone who sees the facts as they are is treated as a traitor to the Serbian people and a NATO lackey. One of the young Serbian women told me that it is extraordinarily difficult for her to explain to her grandmother why she opposes Milosevic, as her grandmother only has her own information and experiences to go by. This means that she cannot understand why this young woman is involved in the OTPOR organisation. We must help the independent democratic media in Serbia so that they can provide accurate information as far as possible, and so that democracy may yet blossom in Serbia. I would also like to say, however, that we naturally expect the “opposition press”, or what remains of it, to denounce the current irregularities in political leadership in the city of Belgrade, for example, which is governed by the MRS, just as much as it justifiably criticises the Milosevic regime. As long as it does not do this and is blind to other shortcomings, it is not an independent medium. I would also like to draw honourable Members’ attention to the following point: given that we are now hearing suggestions that Mr Draskovic is once again on the way to collaborating with Mr Milosevic, we have to be very careful about who we give help to. OTPOR, the real resistance group in Serbia, which grew out of the student movement, is as at present being prevented by Milosevic from registering as an organisation. Nevertheless, this will not stop it organising demonstrations and displays of good will on the streets of Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia. Next weekend, our delegation will be travelling to Montenegro, and on Sunday will be holding talks with representatives of OTPOR and of the opposition. We will, of course, take this opportunity to sound out what scope there is for supporting them. A contributory factor to the lack of freedom in that country is the Serbian University Law promulgated in October 1998, since when many professors have been removed from their posts. They are forbidden to give lectures and they have been removed from their posts because of allegedly inadequate qualifications. It is evident what is going on if I tell you that one of these allegedly unqualified professors is now a professor at the Universities of Saarbrücken and Berlin. I find it hard to imagine that these universities would employ unqualified Serbian professors. But, of course, they did not fit in with Milosevic’s doctrines. On the other hand, I have to tell you – because we here do not get to know everything that you can only find out by talking with people on the spot – that the extremist nationalist politician Selesj is currently a university professor in the law faculty. You can imagine how they rate quality there! Today’s debate is, of course, first and foremost concerned with conditions in Serbian prisons. There are over 2 000 Kosovo Albanians held in Serbian prisons, most of them since spring 1999, that is before the NATO offensive. The situation in these prisons is indescribable. The people have received no legal representation. If they are then sentenced, this happens with total disregard for the law. Let me remind you about Flora Brovina, the doctor who did nothing more than respect her professional ethics as a doctor, by helping people regardless of their nationality. She was sentenced to 14 years in prison in Serbia, in Niš. The prisons are certainly not in line with any convention, and contravene the Geneva Convention. There is horrifying torture and abuse, and the world is simply looking on. A fortnight ago, I visited Kosovo with 12 colleagues, and that was when Kosovo Albanians gave us these 75 000 signatures. We have brought them here because we want to demonstrate the enormity and the awfulness of the situation of people who have been trying to find out for at least one and a half years where their relatives are – their fathers, their brothers or even their children. I do not think that we can simply file these 75 000 signatures away. We must attempt to at least give these people some certainty about where these missing persons are, what prisons they are in or where they met their death. That is the picture in Serbia. In Kosovo, which we also visited, although the situation is different, there are similar problems. We went to Kosovo last year because we wanted to help the Kosovo Albanians who for ten years have suffered under an apartheid-like regime to obtain attention. The aim we are working towards now in Kosovo is to achieve peaceful coexistence between the majority Albanian population and minorities who are also entitled to live there, be they Serbs, Ashkali or Roma. I believe that we should focus our attention on ensuring that coexistence is possible there. There were many incidents during the last few days of our visit there, and these are occurring again now. There have been murders of Serbs over the last few days. Nobody can say who committed them, but someone is responsible for the fact that a Serb – or even several Serbs – is murdered somewhere every day. We condemn these acts, indeed we condemned them on the spot, and have done so here on several occasions. We call on everyone in positions of responsibility, and now above all Kosovo Albanians, to ensure that when the occasion arises their compatriots behave in a restrained manner and prevent this sort of conduct against minorities. We did not come to the aid of the Kosovo Albanians so that they could make the life of minorities in Kosovo hell. It also has to be said, because we do not know who the culprits are, that it cannot, of course, be ruled out some of the people responsible for these acts are possibly being infiltrated into Kosovo from Serbia as agents provocateurs
, because they simply do not want peace in Kosovo.  All of us in the European Union, and also UNMIK, must take swift action in that region now. UNMIK must ensure that there is a legal framework, so that the culprits can be caught, put behind bars and punished. But in Kosovo there is also the problem of missing Serbs, which we are all familiar with. We call on the Kosovo Albanians to speak now and to inform the Red Cross if they know anything about the whereabouts of these Serbs and people of other nationalities, so as to put an end to this uncertainty. The few Serbs in Kosovo who want to work with the administration of course also have a problem. They are viewed as traitors by some of their own compatriots. That being the case, we must help these well intentioned Serbs to achieve some positive results, so that their cooperation is clearly of some benefit for the Serbian population. We must try to ensure greater police protection. That is why I appeal to all the Member States to send as many police officers as possible to Kosovo, in order to guarantee protection for minorities also. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we are going to talk about topicality then all I can say is that you cannot get more topical than Kosovo and Serbia. The Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy have just got back from a joint trip to Kosovo. While we were there we promised that we would do our best to adopt a motion of this kind this week. I urge the honourable members to support this motion for a resolution. We must bring pressure to bear on Serbia, and also on the Albanians in Kosovo, so as to make them put things to rights. We can only do this using the modest means at our disposal, namely a motion for a resolution. The Balkans region is a little nearer to us than Fiji as matters stand, and if it is money we are worried about then I am bound to say that we are footing the bill rather a lot in Kosovo!

Mr President, I am in favour, although I take the view that it is not quite as urgent as the Council makes out. However, it would be an insult to the people of Montenegro if we rejected this urgency today. Montenegro is in great danger, especially from Belgrade, and I think we should send out this signal. However, we should wait until the Commission finally tells us where it intends to find the money. It cannot take it away from Bosnia. It cannot take it away from Kosovo. It needs to tell us where it intends to find the money and if we reach a decision on this today, we must carry out an evaluation half way through and say what has happened to the money and where the second tranche is to come from.

Mr President, first of all I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Lagendijk for his report. I can give it my full support, and I am delighted that a Christian Democrat can fully support a green report, because that would suggest we are going down the right track together and have shared the same experiences.   This debate is taking place at an opportune moment today, as has already been mentioned. The donor conference had a positive outcome, at least on paper. Money is to be poured into projects that will at last be able to give the pact a face. It has been something of a mirage so far: the outcome was intangible. Work is now to begin at last, and the costly palaver is over. It is in fact a shame that the coordinator’s apprenticeship had to last so long.   Experts on the region have long been familiar with the projects to be undertaken there, which have now been defined by the European Union and the European Investment Bank. We could have, and in fact should have, made a start on them in the autumn. However, I would also like to take the decisions reached by the Council of Ministers to task at this point, and say that establishing a reconstruction agency in Thessaloniki and a coordinator in Brussels, and then not allowing the two to cooperate, shows what little inclination there is to promote efficiency. There can be no stability without reconstruction, and vice versa.  We must now swiftly regain lost ground. EUR 1.8 billion for the next twelve months can be used to set one or two things in train, so that the people in the region are at last able to see that we are serious when we make our grandiose statements about securing stability in the region. But this will not be possible without reconstruction and functioning institutions, and we need to work quickly to achieve both. Every euro that actually goes towards the projects and does not get caught up in the imbroglio of excessive activities and organisations, or even disappear on account of corruption, will be a euro well spent. We must be on our guard here. However, the wars in the region were more expensive in every respect than all the necessary measures will prove to be.   The idea of having a Stability Pact is a sound one because it is geared primarily towards cross-border measures, and thus to prevention of conflicts. Many local politicians and governments have grasped this and have already created a cross-border, regular working level. In implementing this instrument with rigour the European Union will be able to establish a successful and exemplary policy. However, all parties involved in the Stability Pact will need a great deal of stamina. It takes time and continuity to establish and consolidate stability. The recipient countries face the particular challenge of reforming their administration and their institutions, so as to create the right conditions for foreign investment and to enable them to become ever less dependent on external aid.   However, stability in the region depends to a large extent in most spheres on the eradication of criminal power structures and the construction of structures befitting a state under the rule of law, as is the case in Bosnia for example. Elections are no panacea. One cannot vote democracy into being. Take last Sunday’s elections in the Republika Srpska in Bosnia. The parties of Karadzic and Kraijnik gained the most support. The return of the refugees is precisely what is needed to help restore normality and democracy, and that is why the refugee merry-go-round of Bosnia and Croatia, for example, must be set in motion without delay within the context of the Stability Pact. This will cost money. Mine clearance, job creation, schools and preventive health care must go hand in hand with repatriation. Unfortunately, the High Representatives in Bosnia have also wasted a great deal of time. They have tolerated, or even promoted, parallel structures for too long. We have not made nearly as much progress as we could have done when it comes to bridging the ethnic divide, which was created by the war, and, I am sorry to say, perpetuated by Dayton to some extent. Efforts to initiate and undertake judicial reform, in Bosnia for example, are in a state of disarray. The court judgements are not even being implemented. Instead of maintaining a protectorate for decades, more commitment should be given to establishing the nation state of Bosnia Herzegovina. Turning once again to the idea of a Stability Pact: as with European unification, the key is to motivate social groupings and their various interests, as well as States, to work towards a common goal. If we are to stabilise South-Eastern Europe, then the institutions concerned with the economy, culture, and educational policy that are either present or to be created in the respective States, must be encouraged to cooperate ever more closely with each other and with their European counterparts.   We must now seize the opportunity and quickly create examples that will show the Serbs in Yugoslavia that it would be better if they were to rid themselves of the dictator Milosevic and then tread the path to Europe along with their neighbours.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely has there been so much insight and common sense in evidence on all sides of this House, as is proving to be the case during this debate today. That is no doubt due to the issue we are dealing with, the urgent nature and significance of which everyone deems equally important. We want to prepare ourselves well for the European Year of Languages. Indeed that is why all three institutions have been making overtures to each other and sparing themselves long-winded negotiations. I would expressly like to thank Mr Graça Moura for the work he has done. It has been such an outstanding effort that all the coordinators in the committee simply had to give him their backing. I have to admit that his charm must have had a lot to do with this, as well as his expertise of course!   What are we aiming to achieve with this action, which we are supporting so vigorously? We want to make our fellow citizens receptive to the advantages that mastering several languages brings. The different languages are part of cultural diversity, and understanding other languages is a particularly effective way of tapping into the riches of our cultural heritage. It is simply wonderful to be able to read and understand a poem by Verlaine in French, or one by Heine in German, or by Vasco Graça Moura in Portuguese. But even at a mundane everyday level, one cannot get far without a knowledge of other languages. Indeed, only those who speak several languages can gain full access to the internal market.   As the Socrates rapporteur, I am very much in favour of placing special emphasis on the importance of learning the language spoken by one’s European neighbours, and of launching pilot projects on this very issue, in the course of the Year of Languages.  Of course we all hope that the measures planned for this Year of Languages are not one-day wonders, rather they should extend well beyond the year itself.   I hope the Year of Languages will bring the success we all need. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I bid you good morning! It is in fact the case that all politicians ought to feel a sense of responsibility for this programme and take it particularly seriously, for if we do not succeed in convincing young Europeans, who could pass these convictions further down the line, the European edifice is on shaky ground. We must therefore do everything we can to create the conditions that will enable girls and boys to feel at home in the Europe we have created, and to respect and appreciate the differences between people.   This youth programme is an important instrument for teaching people to show mutual understanding and display tolerance. Voluntary activities in the environmental and cultural spheres help people to learn what Europe is really all about and also to learn other languages. Interpersonal contact alone facilitates the acquisition of democratic values and promotes understanding on the part of European citizens. That is what this programme is intended to achieve. I feel now is also the time to say that it is not on for Austrian young people to be excluded from taking part in these programmes as a consequence of so-called bilateral sanctions. This is misguided and should be contested by everyone, and particularly by this Parliament and the Commission.   This new programme has enabled us to consolidate and improve on previous youth activities. Thanks to our proposed amendments we have also improved the level of social protection for participants. Of course the total amount that has now been made available does not suffice, although concerted action on our part enabled us to get more out of the Council than they wanted to give. But the total amount gives the lie to the Ministers who get up on their soapboxes to speak! I am certain, however, that we will make the best of it, and many young people will benefit as a result I would also very much like to thank Mrs Gröner for taking on this mammoth task and still being able in the end to reach a satisfactory outcome with the Council and the Commission. Thank you very much and the best of luck!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that we have debated the media in Serbia; we have been discussing this matter for years. We should remember that, in October 1998, once NATO considered that the first planned attack on Serbia in order to help the Kosovars was over, because Milosevic had allegedly given way and allowed unarmed OSCE observers into the country, that it was precisely at this point that this Information Act was issued and began causing so many problems for the independent media: and now we are looking at the result. It has become clear over the last two years that the media are being increasingly sidelined. But we have already said that. How weak must the Milosevic regime really feel, given how it treats the media? Apparently he is terrified that the awful truth of his inhumane treatment of all Serbian citizens over the years, even against the Serbs in Serbia, might finally be revealed to the majority of these citizens, terrified that the people might soon deal with Milosevic and his henchmen the way the Romanians dealt with Ceaucescu. I think he is terrified of this and we should help the media so that they can spread the truth about Milosevic and his regime.

 Mr President, Mr Solana, I don’t want to repeat everything that has already been said here. I will confine myself to asking more questions, as you suggested we should do. I regard the Stability Pact as the best idea we have ever had. However, it must also actually be made to work in such a way that it does not just serve to create frustrations, hence my questions. Firstly: to what extent are you able to influence the professionalism of the Council’s decisions? Could you at last bring about change in this respect? Let me give you an example: there is an institution in Thessaloniki that does not actually exist at all as yet, but it has been set up, namely the Reconstruction Agency for whatever, for the whole of the Balkan region.  At the same time, the Stability Pact was established here in Brussels with a single coordinator. Can you tell me how much synergy is lost here and why the Council allows something like that to happen? This is grossly unprofessional! Can you prevent this from happening in future?   Secondly, when you talk to the Ministers for Home Affairs on Saturday it must not just be about the remote possibility of sending police officers. I would ask you quite specifically: the police officers in Kosovo at present number scarcely a third of those promised and who are due to travel there. KFOR could step up its presence in Mitrovica and be stationed in crisis areas of Kosovo if its current tasks were to be taken on by policemen.   Thirdly, could you convince the Council of the fact that its rhetoric at summit meetings must at last be put into practice, in the form of additional financial resources? We need a special fund for crisis regions, so that we are not always taking funds away from other necessary tasks for which financial provision has already been made from other sources; in other words, so as to avoid having to reallocate this money to implement ideas that the Council has suddenly hit on. We need a crisis fund which can then be used to pay for such eventualities.   Lastly, a word on the subject of Chechnya. It is all well and good, and touching, when we wring our hands over the mass graves and the refugees. Only I have to ask myself what have we actually done to try and prevent it? Why did we not send an intervention force there when all this was happening?   (Heckling from Mr Cohn-Bendit)
 We cannot do that, my dear Daniel. Why have we not stopped sending the money that is financing the army over there? I believe that is what our task ought to have been, and you could play a part in this!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sakellariou, I would not wish to speak for Mr Dupuis but I do not think one should be selective. If you sign something with Mr Modrow then you could do so with Mr Dupuis and others. Mr Modrow belongs to the Communist Group and is one of the last leaders of the DDR. If you sign something with him then you must also consider whether you were in earnest when you said what you did to Mr Dupuis.   Returning to urgent matters: unfortunately, as much as we may want to, we will be unable to solve the general problems facing Kosovo during today’s urgency debate. Nor is this the right time for us to consider the questions put by Mr Dupuis. We cannot ask today what is to become of Kosovo. That is really something we should do in a foreign affairs debate. We are here today to deal with an urgent topic, that of having to discuss, for the second time, a motion on the subject of Albanian Kosovan prisoners in Serbia. I really have to wonder why we adopted this motion last September. I have neither read nor heard that the Council has taken it to heart.   I really have to wonder if the Council has even a scrap of the least compassion one should feel for one’s fellow human beings. If the representatives of the Council had sons, brothers or fathers in the prisons in Serbia then I feel there would be a more rapid response. In common with you all, I too have heard the cries for help uttered by the mothers, wives and daughters of Albanian Kosovans sitting in Serbian prisons. To be quite honest, though, not a soul is helping them.   I was in Pristina recently and searched in vain for three students at the university, whom I have known for years. I know where they are: they are in Serb prisons, yet they have done nothing, I repeat nothing! There is no reason for them to be there. They have not come to anyone’s attention for terrorist or military reasons. I therefore believe that we must take up this cause.   The Albanian doctor, Flora Brovina, who was sentenced in Niš on 13 January, is now in a prison hospital and is extremely ill. She was sentenced because she gave assistance as a doctor to all wounded people, irrespective of where they came from. She was neither a terrorist nor a UCK activist. But not a soul is helping this woman to get out of prison.   I therefore believe that the Council of Ministers has no interest whatsoever in tragedies of this kind. That is tragic to my mind. Things have come to a pretty pass when we MEPs pass on the cries for help and none of those in positions of responsibility hear them. The sanctions are now slowly being relaxed. Did it never occur to anyone to make the relaxation of sanctions conditional on the Serbian Government actually doing something about this? It seems not.  We should also consider the situation in Mitrovica, and I concede that Mr Sakellariou is absolutely right about this. It is not just the Serbs that we must demand civilised behaviour from, we must now call upon those to whose aid we went to refrain from avenging terror with terror. Otherwise we will be just as lacking in credibility. And so that is why I believe that we must call upon the people to whom we provided assistance to behave in a truly civilised manner.   Mitrovica must not remain divided. We have had enough divided cities in Europe and still have them. I believe we must prevent this from happening. If attacks are now being made on KFOR then all I can say is that these are our sons and we sent them there to help the Albanians and the Serbs and anyone else living in Kosovo. We are entitled to expect them not to be punished for serving in Kosovo of their volition. Hence I expect everyone there, be they Albanian or Serb, to leave the KFOR troops in peace.   I endorse what Mr Sakellariou had to say. The international community must send the police force it has been promising them at long last. A third of this force is there, two thirds are yet to come, and I believe this is what we need to do.   I would just like to point out that something terrible is going on in Serbia at present. Mr Seselj, this nationalist, who is actually a war criminal, is obstructing the last vestige of press freedom they have over there. We must clamp down on this or else we will be unable to receive any accurate information whatsoever from the Serbian people!   (Applause)

 Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis. What we are doing here is not hypocritical. We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it. Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything. I think we should take a more positive approach here. Macedonia did not go through a war. But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries. It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war. So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines. This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success. Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia. I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there. I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country. As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects. Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria. I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support. (Applause)

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme. To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle. Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission. As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission. The Commission gives no soul to Europe. Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe. Just a few main points. I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs. I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning. Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe. Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens. It seems to me that something is missing from this programme. Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture. Declarations of principle are not enough. We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.

 Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all. What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate. As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament. This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn. No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result. No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK. In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either. Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them. In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities – not forgetting the Roma of course – in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place. I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about. Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors. That is excellent news! There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources. It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.  There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions. Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country. I believe that is a good thing I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way. The EU Commission cannot pay for everything. It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner’s outstanding bills. One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill. We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.

 Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate. Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it. We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht. For no one is very keen to spend money on culture. Sadly that is the case and we must face facts. I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course. We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect. One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision. What kind of horse-trading system is this? Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture. It is downright scandalous what goes on! It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions! Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to. It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us. We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access. I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner’s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union. If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit. It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.

 Mr President, of course I should not like to confine my comments to the work of the Conciliation Committee, because this would surely not go far enough. I think that we should also use this second reading once again to hold a general debate on education in the Europe of the future. At the end I will come back to the outcome of the conciliation procedure. The issue of education in the Europe of the future is also the issue of the future of Europe itself. This is actually a fact which the members of the Council ought finally to take on board. Europe can only continue to grow together if the people of Europe accept this process and are prepared to play an active part in it. This is particularly important in the light of the enlargement of the EU towards which we are working. Our hopes are centred first and foremost on the young generation in our countries. They are the ones who will shape the future of Europe. That is why we need to win over young people to the European project. That is why we need to meet them, at least to some extent, where they already are in terms of their present knowledge and expectations. Many of them think in much more global terms and often have considerably more personal experience of being abroad than we had when we were young. But, of course, there are many others who lack this personal experience, who – like their parents – are frightened of this large Europe because they do not understand it, and who have never had the opportunity to spend time with people from other countries. This is why I believe that the European education policy is one of the key tasks within the European Union. As more aspects of European society become intertwined, communication and therefore mastering foreign languages will become increasingly important. Economic integration owing to the internal market makes mobility a key factor. Closer integration inevitably forces us to confront different views. The pluralism of cultures and world views means, however, that greater mutual understanding and thus more knowledge about others is required, which means that information needs to be exchanged. Imparting all this knowledge and experience needs to start early on. That is how the first comprehensive European programme for cooperation in all spheres of education came about in 1995; it was called Socrates. Since then, I have been the rapporteur and am glad that this programme has been really extremely successful. Now we are launching the Socrates II programme for 2000 to 2007. This programme consists, firstly, of the opportunities offered to schools under Comenius, which encourages school classes from different countries throughout Europe to work together on projects. Its second part is Erasmus, which addresses student mobility, and then the third component – called Gruntvig – is adult education, an initiative which has finally led to progress being made in an area where action had been necessary in the European Union for some considerable time. Adult education became part of the Socrates I programme in 1995 by a circuitous route, through an amendment which I tabled. In the course of the year, this led to people throughout Europe developing a desire for adult education and lifelong learning and we believe that the response to this in the shape of the Gruntvig part of Socrates is the right response. I am proud that we have achieved this. It is precisely this incorporation of Gruntvig in the Socrates programme which actually shows how Europe works. This was an idea which had always had a foothold in the northern countries – in Austria, in the Scandinavian countries, in Germany; in England too the concept of adult education has always existed – but in the southern countries it had not taken root to such an extent. In Europe we managed to establish this everywhere. I am proud of this. That is why I believe that here too, we have achieved something important precisely for the next seven years. I now come to the subject which concerns us all, namely the result of the Conciliation Committee's deliberations. In terms of content, we have achieved all that we set out to achieve. I should like very much to welcome the fact that the Council has agreed that when we award mobility grants we can at long last, consider the possibility of only giving them to those who really need them, so that those who might not otherwise be able to take part for financial reasons can perhaps also take part after all, because the money is made available to them in this way. I also welcome the fact that the Council has agreed to step up support for learning our neighbours' languages. I very much regret that the Council was not in a position to join us in including the term "European educational area". They hummed and hawed as if this European educational area did not yet exist. It does exist, but in the end for the sake of keeping the peace we gave in, so that there will continue to be a European dimension in education. As far as the budget is concerned, Mr President – you were there, but I must repeat this – I am not happy. We wanted EUR 2.5 billion, which is the amount which we would have required for this major undertaking. Unfortunately, we only obtained EUR 1.85 billion, but with an assurance that a review clause would be incorporated after two years. I believe that we can be satisfied with this. I hope that this programme is just as successful as Socrates I. (Applause)

Madam President, Mrs Reding, allow me to congratulate you on your initiative on the issue of doping. We can only hope that you will make some proper headway with the people who always make out that they would fight doping. I think we are on the right track and I wish you luck. However, I would like to come back to what my colleague, Mr Cohn-Bendit said. We cannot legislate because, as you said, there is no legal basis in the Treaty. As you know, in my 1996 report, I called, on behalf of Parliament, for sport to be included in the Treaty at long last. We wanted it to have its own line in Article 128 – under culture. But we failed. There is something like a declaration attached to the Treaty, but it is not enough to prevent our having to ask ourselves every year when we debate the budget, should we or should we not fund sport? I think that if what you have said, if what you submit to the Council in Helsinki is to make sense, then we must conclude that the European Parliament is not confined to making statements on Bosman judgements or competition issues in sport, but can give sport a true value by paying more than mere lip service to it in the Treaty. Only then will we be able to do what my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit said, only then will we be able to use the budget to give constructive support to cross-border sporting events. I urge you from the bottom of my heart to persuade your colleagues at the Commission to take a real step forward with the Council in Helsinki by including a sub-section on sport in the Treaty. Only then will we be able to make any real progress on this issue! (Applause)

 Mr President, the situation in Kosovo is marked by great uncertainty and violence and even by murder from time to time and in the end, as we have heard, that discredits us all. In many cases in which I have tried to help since 1989, I have felt myself to be personally compromised. Why did we intervene as an international community? We decided to help the Albanians because their basic and human rights were being infringed. For that reason we went in and I still believe that it was the right thing to do. Over eight years of an apartheid regime in Kosovo the Albanians did not do anything to anyone, neither to the Serbs nor to the Roma, nor to the Croats, nor to the Bosnians. But they have suffered dreadfully and we must not forget that. The mass graves, more of which are found every day, are proof of this. I therefore believe that it will be very difficult for them to live together. Wounds heal extremely slowly. We in Central and Northern Europe know that too. I therefore believe that we must demand something, that they can contribute and that is, coexistence on the ground. And we must help them. These criminal acts must also be denounced by the Albanian leaders. We must help with the means at our disposal to find the perpetrators and convict them. We want to prevent injustice and now some of those we have helped are turning out to be liars and are themselves driving out minorities. The Roma, Serbs, Croats and Bosnians, anyone in fact who might not speak this language, belongs to this group. I should not like the oppressed people to become oppressors themselves. We must therefore ensure that in the communities where there is persecution, even the reconstruction be suspended, so that every single citizen in this country takes responsibility himself and ensures that such criminal acts do not occur again. KFOR cannot be everywhere, it cannot stand behind everyone and so every decent Albanian – and there are more of them than we think – really must feel that they themselves are taking responsibility. The problem is also that the Albanian leaders or those people who think they are, are not really in a position jointly to build the future for this land, for their homeland, and so we must also appeal to them. I believe that we need an interim government – and more quickly than Mr Kouchner is able to establish one. Secondly, at local level, we need really responsible people and if these people cannot be Albanians or Serbs where they are in the majority, then it must be someone from the international community so that we have a contact to talk to. Everywhere, where things are going well in the communities, we must react positively and say that we are helping you more than we help those who do nothing. Now – this is of course a difficult task which must be carried out by UNMIG – the problem is that this is something that is easier to solve on paper than in reality. But I am not of the opinion that we can do all of that merely by installing democracy. We must do that, but the first need is to create jobs, we must create infrastructure, so that the young people who are now going around with Kalashnikovs, can finally hold tools in their hands and do something for their country. Then we shall be on the right path and Mr Kouchner must also be a little more effective than he is at the moment, whoever may be hampering him in carrying out his task. (Applause)

 Mr President, this morning we heard in the debate on Tampere that the Presidency of the Council has finally consented officially to take note of our report and to give serious consideration to the demands contained therein. Whatever this means, I take the fact seriously and hope that, as from Friday, the Presidency will enter the general debate so that we might obtain a functioning Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki, together with a Stability Pact, and that our proposals regarding the functioning of the Agency in Kosovo might really be given serious consideration.  I must now, before the debate, quite sincerely ask the new Commission to take this first opportunity it has had to express its opinion on what Parliament has said on this matter. I would ask you, Chris Patten, to take the floor. (Applause)

 Mr President, I wanted to sincerely thank our colleague, Mr Graça Moura, for taking over this report and really being content to take forward what we had already decided in the last legislative period and which was the work of Nana Mouskouri, whose warm greetings I am to pass on to you today. She is very happy that things are finally moving forward.  The model of society which forms the basis of this report by Mr Graça Moura is a deeply humanitarian one. Culture plays an important role in this model, and partly for the purpose of facilitating respect on the part of our citizens for each other’s different cultures, as well as for national and regional traditions.  This new programme sets out the framework for the European Union’s cultural policy for the next few years. It must be added that a genuine policy on culture and education is needed today more than ever, since it is the actual basis of European politics. Above all, however, it gives a human face to the distant and bureaucratic politics of Europe and puts the citizen in the centre of activity and debate, as is also happening with the “Youth” programme and with the “Socrates” education programme.  The European Union should not just be a question of figures and statistics, for example. Only the genuine participation of its citizens makes it a living whole. When we see that the European Union has precisely 167 million ecus left for cultural policy, we naturally regard this as a ridiculous sum. As insiders, we know of course that what we are doing in terms of cultural policy is not confined to the area covered by this sum. We are also working in the cultural sphere when it comes to the areas covered by the regional funds. However, EUR 167 million is too small a sum. Even EUR 250 million would not be enough in view of the scale of the work which awaits us. I consider that the cultural sphere, to which we have the task of giving a higher profile, requires a much larger sum of money. But that is how it is everywhere in the European Union. Everyone gets up on their soapbox and says that Europe must be given a soul. That is a wonderful catchword. Everyone hides behind it but, unfortunately, not a lot of money is spent on it. I believe it is the same in every country.  This cultural programme can basically make only a small contribution to realising this desire that neighbours should be made genuinely aware of each other’s respective cultures.  In the form in which we now have the report, extensive parts of the former Commission’s proposal have been changed. We have responded more to the will of our citizens and have been that much less inclined to go in for big events. I know that this is also the attitude of the new Commissioner. I hope that the quality of the projects which we are now to have will make up for the lack of financial resources.

 Madam President, I am sorry, but I was getting Tuesday and Wednesday confused. I would be most grateful if you could advise me whether it would be possible for the Council, before the vote on the report on Kosovo – which we have urged should take place – to at last provide its comments on Parliament’s amendments, following which we will then be able to hold the final vote. We had made a written request for the Council to be present, for it to comment and for us to hold the vote only after this has been done. Has it now been resolved that this is how matters are to be handled?

 Madam President, I should like to ask that we reject the request for urgent debate. During the last part-session of Parliament, we did not see any requests for urgent debate because we still wanted to give the Council and the Commission the opportunity to have a proper look at our amendments and to also evaluate them and perhaps even comply with them. It is not acceptable that, during the summer recess, we should, in no time at all, have responded to the Council’s request by producing a report, and that the Council should then not even have taken note of what we had proposed by way of amendments, let alone thought of complying with them. We expect that, by the time of the next part-session in October, the Council will have told us which of our amendments it has accepted and which it has not. At the last part-session in Brussels, Chris Patten told us that he too would examine these proposals and would then present one of his own. I believe that if, by means of its proposals, Parliament is speaking up for more efficiency in spending tax revenue, the Council should not do the opposite. If, in fact, money ever disappears or gets lost in the wheels of administration, then it is always the Commission which is to blame and never the Council.  We should like, as this agency gets off the ground, for everything really to be perfectly clear, for the administration to be stringent, for the headquarters of the Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki to be closely linked to the headquarters of the Stability Pact (also in Thessaloniki) and for the Kosovo Agency to be an operational component of this in Kosovo. We also want the administrative structures to be so strict that the processes through which money is spent are precisely visible.  I should like here to contradict anyone who maintains that reconstruction in Kosovo will not be possible if we do not take a vote here today. That is nonsense. The EU Commission’s Task Force is already working in the area itself. It is doing this and, ladies and gentlemen, you all know very well that the Commission never pays up very quickly and that we cannot therefore say: today it issues its instructions and tomorrow it pays. It can confer the assignment today, and when, in October, the amount required has been estimated, it will then pay, perhaps in November or December at the earliest – as always, unfortunately, very belatedly.  We are not the ones who are impeding the reconstruction of Kosovo. It is the Council which will be doing this if it does not soon follow us on the path that we have embarked upon here.

 Madam President, first of all I would like to say to the Members who are thanking the French government or the city of Strasbourg for this building, that they are addressing their comments to the wrong people. We were the ones who had the house built so we should be the ones beating our own breast if mistakes have been made. But I am not here to offer praise. The building is fine. It is the many defects I would like to comment on now. Firstly, Madam President, if you ever had to send a fax in my office or that of my fellow Members, I could tell you it is practically impossible! You would have to stand on a chair, a swivel chair, to be able to look down on the top of this machine. You probably know that most accidents in all the households in Europe happen because housewives are trying to stand on some sort of swivel chair, which should be avoided if possible. I would not like to know how much money the insurers of this building will have to pay out in future for all the medium-sized persons climbing up on these chairs. People like me. I am just 1.60 m tall. I’m just not tall enough. I need assistance. There is a notice on it saying, “Please do not move”. Secondly, Madam President, I drive a normal passenger car into the entrance of our car park. You cannot get to Level 2 if you don’t reverse in order to take the bend. Well, you can imagine what it gets like in the rush hour. There are cars coming from the left, from in front, from behind, and there is always someone who has to reverse so he can get round the bend. My heartfelt request is that this central reservation is halved in size so that we can enter the car park without having to reverse. Apart from that I do not see why I should have to insert my pass twice when entering the car park, once on top and once in the middle. That’s just crazy. If I have already got in at the top, I should be able to carry on inside. I understand even less why, when I’m leaving in the evening or at night, I have to do the same again. Once I’m inside, you might as well let me out! The situation is just ridiculous on both counts. In the rush hours it is just not feasible. Thirdly, in the morning I would like to be able to get my newspaper quickly. There is no newspaper stand nearby. I still have not found the newspaper stand. I always ask someone who knows where the stand is to bring me one back.  Fourthly, this week I have got into a lift five times and not been able to get out at my own floor. I wanted to get out on the tenth floor. It wasn’t on. Five times that has happened to me. Then I thought, “right, let’s avoid that particular lift”, and since then I have always tried to take another lift. It is, of course, an intolerable situation in this building. As the person responsible for a delegation – I chair the South-Eastern Europe Delegation, this has nothing to do with the Louise Weiss building, but with the Salvador de Madariaga building across the way – I would now like to make one more request. At least four of the delegation staff occupy a tiny cell, which I previously had to myself. The first is talking to Dagestan, the second to Moscow, the third to Macedonia and the fourth perhaps to Cologne. Can you imagine it, in a single room? Please could you do something for the members of staff! The present situation is unbearable!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about a Reconstruction Agency for South-East Europe whose first operational Agency is to be opened in Pristina, Kosovo. Unlike other institutions in Europe, we have learned a lesson from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We want efficiency right from the start, and this ought not to be compromised from the beginning because the decisions are being taken a long way away. We learned this in Bosnia, and the warning has not been lost on us. Mr Schwaiger, the last rapporteur at OBNOVA, stipulated this for Bosnia at that time. We therefore attach a lot of importance to having the Agency which is to manage the reconstruction in Kosovo situated in Pristina. I concede, however, that it is a part of the large Reconstruction Agency for the whole of the western Balkans, and for South-East Europe, which will have its headquarters in Thessaloniki. I shall come back to this question of the Agency’s location and everything connected with it, as well as to the question of its efficiency.  What ought this Agency to be doing now in Kosovo? It is to carry out reconstruction on-site, but it is not responsible for only the bricks and mortar. It is also responsible for re-establishing constitutional relationships. It is responsible for rebuilding the infrastructure. It is responsible for establishing businesses, for all this is necessary in order to give the refugees decent homes and the chance to live in Kosovo again. In Kosovo, it is a question not only of a post-war situation which, from the point of view of damage, is not as bad as we had assumed at the beginning. We also know that the Albanians are in a position to do a very great deal themselves. They are not waiting for the mortar to be supplied to them by others. They are taking the matter in hand themselves. They are also content when they have already rebuilt parts of their houses and can then go on little by little to rebuild more.  No, this Agency also has a quite different task. It must in fact also fill the vacuum that has arisen in the last nine years. There are no authorities there. There is no administrative structure. This is why it is also so incredibly difficult to make any progress at all with the reconstruction and with getting companies established there. Forms of ownership have not been clarified. They cannot tell a firm in Western Europe that they can go and establish themselves there and take over an existing firm. That is just not on at all because no one knows to whom such firms belong. To a large extent, they are in fact state property. The question of who owns the land has not been clarified either. All these matters are the basis for primary tasks to be carried out by the new Agency on-site, and it is only on-site that they can be carried out.  We need people down there to fulfil really important tasks. We need engineers. We also need mine-clearance personnel. We need all types of know-how. That is what this Agency is designed for.  In this case, we have already achieved some things, or else others have conceded things to us – perhaps in anticipation of obedience to Parliament. For example, the director of the Agency must present a quarterly report on its activities to Parliament; the European Parliament must follow the discharge procedure and certify to the director that the budget plan has been implemented correctly; and the Commission must present to Parliament an annual report approved by the Agency’s administrative board. We also demand that Parliament also, of course, be consulted if the work of this Agency is to be extended into other, similar areas. That cannot happen following a decision by the Council alone. We do not accept any more faits accomplis
, where we have not been consulted.  (Applause)
 This report was forwarded to us in July. I have spent my holiday attending to, and then presenting, this report.  The Council has already issued a joint statement of its position which, it told me yesterday, it could no longer change. That of course is just not on. If today we were to take a final vote on this report, then, when it came down to it, we would have a situation in which the Council would be saying “Yes, you have worked well and what you have written is good, but we are not interested.” That is not going to happen today. We shall ask the Commission to take our side in accordance with the five points which were agreed yesterday, and in the weeks to come we shall ensure that the Council accepts most of what we said here, preferably everything, because we have in fact been working really quite efficiently. (Applause)
 I come now to a point which particularly exasperates me. The Reconstruction Agency – the umbrella organisation – is in Thessaloniki. The Stability Pact has its headquarters in Brussels. Can someone explain to me how stability in the western Balkans is to be organised from Brussels? I personally could not, and I am certain that the gentleman whose task this is is much less well placed to explain.  (Applause)
 I would therefore urge you to help me convince the Council that the Reconstruction Agency for South-East Europe with its headquarters in Thessaloniki must be very closely connected with the headquarters of the Stability Pact, which must also be in Thessaloniki. I should like to add something on this matter. This Stability Pact intends to organise round-table conferences and is in fact already doing so. Do you know what round-table conferences are? Everyone in South-East Europe is sick to death of these. In the end, nothing of practical value comes out of them. If the Stability Pact were to organise a “working” table conference for democratisation and human rights, all well and good. Except that the Royaumont Initiative is already involved in precisely this field. Or if it were to organise a round-table conference on the subject of economic reconstruction, development and co-operation, again all well and good. But SECI is already doing that. Or it could do something on security issues. However, the South-Eastern European Defence Ministers’ Group is already doing this. So, there are at least four different organisations and groups down there with round tables and square tables, and all to no avail. In the end, nothing emerges from it all. I am therefore asking the Council to combine the hea4dquarters of the Stability Pact and that of the Reconstruction Agency, to dovetail the two and finally to incorporate effectively the initiatives I have mentioned (I do not want to list them again now; you can read them in the minutes.) We do not need to re-invent the wheel when people have already been working on these matters for years. I would therefore ask you to support me in order to guarantee in practice the efficiency of this Agency. (Applause)

 Mr President, I have been asked to briefly say something about the vote so that colleagues do not have to be attacked at home for something which is not the case. I should like therefore to say what we are voting about. We want no delay in providing aid to Kosovo, but we do want more efficiency. The Council has proposed an inefficient procedure, and I would therefore ask it to be understood that we accept the headquarters in Thessaloniki as an operational component of the Reconstruction Agency for the whole of South-East Europe with its headquarters in Thessaloniki, but which must be closely linked with the headquarters of the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki. That is an important political point. I would ask you all to bear this in mind. It is one of the essential points. There are also two further points I must make here. We should like to see a simplification of the administration. We should like to see more transparency and more flexibility. In fact, these points are to be found in our amendments. We should also like the Council to include us as soon as it extends the work into other regions. We must be made a part of this. We should also like there, for the time being, to be a time limit of thirty months on the Agency’s work, for the longer we extend this, the more inefficient it becomes. We should set ourselves a limit and try to achieve everything by then. Another really important point is that OLAF must be deployed… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time we have discussed Kosovo today. We are now discussing a matter, in which little can be changed unless there is some goodwill on the part of the powers-that-be in Belgrade. Unfortunately, neither the Kumanovo Agreement between Nato and the Yugoslavian government nor the UN Resolution which gave the mandate for the international presence in Kosovo made any mention of the situation of the Albanian prisoners in Belgrade and the missing persons. Here too we should have learnt from our experience in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, three years after Dayton, we still do not know where many of the missing people are. On a weekly basis I receive queries from families who are still looking for missing persons, and who have not received any details. What sort of people are these who detain thousands of their fellow men for years in inhumane conditions for no good reason, leaving the family members of these prisoners, the wives, mothers and children, in ignorance as to their fate? Perhaps we should appeal to them less as politicians and authorities in this region than as the father or sons they also are. Unfortunately we cannot compel them. The Serbian regime leaves us no formal means to do this. But its conduct goes against any conception of legality, never mind humanity. We therefore call on the UN Administrator, Kouchner, and also the OSCE, to seek a way to ensure their release. We place our hopes in a sub-committee for problems of prisoners and exiles of the Kosovo Transitional Council. But we expect all states in the international community not to lift any of the sanctions against Serbia until, among other things, these prisoners are released. It is possible to have peaceful co-existence between Serbs and Albanians, and between Croats, Muslims and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, only if, among other things, the matter of prisoners and deportees is clarified.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in Office of the Council, ever since 1989, Kosovo has constantly been the subject of debate in this Parliament. We have demanded action and warned against passivity on the part of the West. I make this point so that those who are new here today know that we have been talking about this for a very long time. Unfortunately, the Western governments" lack of action led to Milosevic first launching an assault on Croatia, then on Bosnia Herzegovina, and ultimately creating a bloodbath in Kosovo. There are millions of refugees, umpteen thousand dead and misery everywhere we look in the region. Many years of turning a blind eye is one of the reasons why it was necessary to undertake a military strike. We are all glad that the joint action undertaken by the West and Russia brought the war to an end and made it possible for the Albanian refugees to return to their homeland. But major tasks now await us which we must tackle energetically and efficiently, ensuring above all that we do not exclude the citizens of Kosovo in the process. The errors that we made when undertaking reconstruction work in Bosnia Herzegovina must not be repeated. If the salaries received by the international personnel in Bosnia Herzegovina are not in reasonable proportion to the aid which is received on site, then that is unacceptable and must not be repeated in Kosovo under any circumstances. But we must also avoid making other errors of the kind that the Council is prepared to make now. If the Council were to locate the Kosovo agency in Thessaloniki then inefficiency would be the order of the day. This agency must be located in Kosovo, and not 200 Kilometres away in another country, when all the UN, OSCE, and UNHCR organisations and agencies are located in Kosovo. However, I am convinced that Thessaloniki is the best location for the headquarters of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. I urgently call upon the Council and also the Greek government to vote for this option. Permit me also to mention at this point that I cannot begin to see the point of next week"s spectacle in Sarajevo. One and a half days of spectacle will cost EUR 1.5 million, which is out of all proportion to the achievements that won"t be made that day, since all the things that are supposed to be achieved there have already been decided on in Cologne. How many small and medium-sized enterprises could we set up in Bosnia Herzegovina with this one and a half million euro? How many jobs could we create and how many more people could return than have been able to hitherto? Now just a word for Serbia"s benefit. A warm welcome to two representatives of the Serbian Opposition in the stand. Esteemed colleagues, the Serbian resistance to the Milosevic regime must now be given all the help that we can offer, unlike two years ago when we left the Opposition to their own devices for fear of antagonising the regime. Let us at last learn from our mistakes. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mr Garot for his own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union. Speaking personally, I want to thank him especially for his frank and constructive cooperation in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The Member States are currently engaged in implementing as part of their national policies the Luxembourg Conclusions on reform of the common agricultural policy. Our starting point is that, in accordance with the Brussels Conclusions, the agricultural budget was capped. The funds available must from now on be shared out among farmers in the EU of 25 rather than only in the EU of 15, and moreover, must in future be more discriminatingly applied than was previously the case, so that funds from the first pillar – direct payments, in other words – are to be moved to the second pillar, to rural development. This is something that all of us in this House have always demanded. Mr Garot’s report represents an outstanding assessment of the situation in that it analyses, in the light of enlargement, the factors on which agricultural incomes are currently dependent. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that there are fundamental objectives to be achieved by means of the common agricultural policy. They are as follows: firstly, to guarantee a fair level of income for those who work in agriculture. Secondly, by stabilising incomes, it must maintain agricultural activity throughout the whole area of the European Union. It is for that reason that we believe, firstly, that the retention of the level of public subsidies for agriculture is justified, in particular to reward the multifunctional services it renders to society and to ensure that farmers remain present in all regions, as is provided for in the first pillar. Secondly, we believe there is justification for the Community Budget guaranteeing employment, especially in less-favoured rural areas, and for farms to be rewarded for adaptation to society’s new demands, which is what we understand by the second pillar. In the hope of turning these principles into reality, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, a number of amendments, to which – as I mentioned at the start of my speech – we have been able to secure the rapporteur’s agreement. For example, our specific proposals include the introduction of a system of disaster payments, which is already the practice in other great agricultural nations. We specifically demand that a large proportion of the funds available remain, insofar as possible, in the hands of farmers. It necessarily follows that we are in favour of the norm laid down in the Luxembourg Conclusions – in other words, the single farm payment – being applied when they are implemented at national level. Our final demand is that no major distortions of competition within European agriculture should be allowed to result in the event of the exemption under Article 58 being chosen. Let me conclude by saying that we have to bear in mind that competitiveness and multifunctionality must, again and again, be subjected to scrutiny and assessed, and that due regard must be paid to development. Without an adequate income, no farmer will be able to perform his tasks in producing food and in caring for the Garden of Eden that we still – thank heaven! – have here in Europe, in a professional manner and in line with good practice. We must therefore take the funds available in the agriculture budget and apply them, in a Europe of 25 Member States, in such a way that the competitiveness of working farmers in the market is supported. We must never lose sight of the need to guarantee young farmers a start and to offer them good prospects. These, more than ever, are the challenges we must take up. The common agricultural policy adopted in June 2003 opens up interesting ways of doing this.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when, at the beginning of this year, the Commission’s legislative proposals on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 and the timetable for them were put before us, we were under considerable pressure of time. Parliament was meant to produce its positions by this week. The task before us seemed almost beyond our capacities. Few of us dared to believe that we would manage it. As the rapporteur responsible for the reports on the dairy sector levy and on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products, I can say, with a great deal of satisfaction, that we have done it, and done it together. Cooperation at an early stage across group boundaries, which was our experience particularly with the milk sector, has finally paid off. From the very outset, I was able, in the drafts of my reports, to take into account the concerns of my colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as well as those of the other groups, which meant that there was a manageable number of amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and that the result that you have before you is coherent and consistent. Finally, the small number of amendments tabled in the plenary is evidence of general agreement, which was also reflected in the outstanding voting results in the Agriculture Committee. This is a splendid piece of work, for which I would like to thank most warmly all those Members of this House who have worked with me with this end in mind, showing goodwill, expertise and a willingness to compromise. I also wish to thank the Committee’s secretariat, which was a valued and ever-reliable support to me in my task as it did its coordinating work behind the scenes. The Commission has presented a package of legislation on the dairy sector, and it is one that we very much welcome, including as it does such measures as the retention of the milk quota up to 2015. In order, though, to achieve its goal of bringing the dairy sector into line with WTO requirements, the Commission is offering instruments which – taken as a whole – are highly problematic: further price reductions, quotas raised still further, and the decoupling of milk production from milk premiums. What would be the consequences of such a course of action? If the massive price reductions were implemented as planned hand in hand with extended quotas, the milk quota system would in fact be nullified. In particular, small and medium-sized rural dairies in disadvantaged areas would find it practically impossible to cope with the competition, at which point the decoupling of the sector would do the rest, so that milk production would move very rapidly from grassland and disadvantaged areas to what is termed prime land. The adverse structural, social and environmental consequences in the areas affected could not then be ignored. In order to make dairy farming in the EU more competitive and more efficient, the Commission is frustrating, by means of its proposals, its own structural and rural development policies. It makes no sense, though, to destroy today businesses and jobs, especially in disadvantaged, structurally weak areas, whether this be done out of anticipatory obedience to the WTO or, conceivably, for ideological reasons, since we will, tomorrow, have to replace or create anew these jobs, with a great deal of effort and expense to public funds, using rural development programmes to do it… The need for a gradual transition if such conflicting objectives are to be avoided in this area is therefore plain to see. With the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, then, I have taken another approach. We aim to maintain sustainable and extensive production of milk, especially on grassland. What is clear is that, if dairy farming dies out on grassland and in disadvantaged areas, a great deal of public effort will be needed to maintain the landscape in the state that we all know today, as a valued place in which to relax and go on holiday. This makes the retention of the milk quota system until 2015 right and vital, and – as we want to make reliable policies – let there be no bringing forward of what was decided under Agenda 2000. The price reductions decided on in Agenda 2000, some of which have already been implemented, have already given us more room to manoeuvre in the WTO. This room to manoeuvre was originally to have been made use of in the negotiations. If the outcome of those negotiations is that further price reductions really are necessary, my reports will give an indication of what further price reductions might be like. In order to keep the dairy and cereals sectors on a par – at least to some extent – we are calling for a higher level of compensation for price reductions. The 50 cents proposed are definitely inadequate. The WTO’s argument is irrelevant to the extension of quotas unless the Commission were to have as its declared objective the use of these measures to exert renewed pressure on prices. No representative of the Commission, though, has put it to me in these terms, so we urge that we meet the quota-hungry Member States halfway on this by introducing a flexible system. This means a ‘yes’ to increased quotas, but it must be dependent on the market situation. We propose that a gradual approach be taken to decoupling. At this point in time, there should be none. The Agriculture Committee proposes that this be reconsidered in 2008, when experience will have been gained of decoupling, re-coupling, or simplification in other sectors. We will then be able to have some idea of the likely effects and consequences and fashion the instrument accordingly. It is important, as regards both the milk reports, that a similarly good voting result should be achieved in the plenary as in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Let us join together in sending a clear signal to the Council and the Commission. Sustainable land use can take the place of much environmental, social and regional policy. The European Union is committed to extensive and sustainable agriculture, at the heart of which, in many of Europe’s regions, is the dairy industry. (Applause)

 The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance, but whether the Czech Republic is founded upon the European order is a matter of doubt. Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts. This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.' It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that ‘ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture’. This is an unambiguous verdict. It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain. Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the ‘events full of violence and human tragedies’, which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were ‘unacceptable acts from today's point of view’, nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it. They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture. This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal before us for our consideration has to do with the extension of the ecopoint system applicable to lorries travelling through Austria. I think it important to emphasise at this point that what it is proposed to extend is a derogation for Austria, a derogation to which Austria has been entitled ever since it joined the EU, to which was attached the condition that Austria was to improve its transport infrastructure in such a way as to have a positive effect on the free exchange of goods guaranteed by the Internal Market. If we are now to discuss the extension of a derogation, it must be clear to us that one does not simply maintain the status quo for another three years, so that the decision we are about to take must envisage the derogation coming to an end by 2006 at the latest. My electoral district in the southern part of Baden-Württemberg borders on Austria, which is admittedly a very beautiful country, and, being well acquainted with haulage companies' complaints about the incomprehensibility of the ecopoint system, I agree with my group that the prevailing system has to be changed, and changed in the following respects. The first thing I want to say is that derogations are justified in the Alps, which are a sensitive region. The ecopoint system should therefore apply only, as was originally intended, to transit through the Alps and not also to journeys in the rest of Austria; the alternative would be that the ecopoint system would constitute an arbitrary measure, and other Member States would be able to claim the right to impose their own. Secondly, the system of ecopoints must definitely come to an end in 2006. Thirdly, the state of technological development means that HGVs in emission categories 3 and 4 should lose their ecopoint liability altogether. In addition, I demand, specifically for what I will call ‘Hörbrenz-Transit’, which particularly affects my electoral district – that is, traffic passing over a connecting stretch, only 16 kilometres long, between the German A 96 and the Swiss A 14 – special treatment in the form of the provision of an adequate number of ecopoints.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to welcome the overall objective sought by the Commission's proposal, namely of making our roads even safer. I am therefore grateful to all of the Members who have worked on it in the committees to bring us closer to this objective. Allow me, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and as someone from a rural constituency, nevertheless to make a number of critical comments. At first sight, the title ‘harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport’ does not appear to have any relevance for agriculture policy. However, the Commission proposal contains a number of points which are also important for agriculture. Alongside vehicles that the layperson would imagine to be passenger, goods or towing vehicles in the conventional sense, namely cars or lorries, the Commission proposal also affects vehicles that are used in farming. Hitherto these were excluded by virtue of the old Article 13. If courier and express delivery services are frequently involved in serious accidents then it may well be justified to include them in the scope of this regulation. But for milk collection vehicles and tractors to be made subject to provisions of this kind as well does seem to me to be very arbitrary. Imagine what this means in real life: tractors – and some are really very small – with tachographs, or the driver of a milk lorry, who goes from farm to farm and can no longer have his little chat (rest period) with farmer X because he has to respect a very particular sequence of driving times and rest periods, as if he were travelling from Rotterdam to Munich. Let me give you another example: Article 13 provides for an exemption for the transport of live animals within a 50-kilometre radius. For vehicles transporting animal carcasses and offal there is no such exemption. What is the reasoning behind this? I view the restrictions that are to be introduced on breakdown vehicles in a similarly critical light. The current regulation, which provided for exemptions in the areas that I have mentioned, certainly did not penalise the weaker members of society, but it was practicable. Thankfully my group has tabled amendments that mitigate some of these shortcomings in the Commission proposal. Nevertheless, I am certainly of the opinion that there will still be much more to correct before the second reading, precisely in the agricultural sector, if we want legislation that the public will understand and also accept. Anything else just causes bad feeling towards Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nowadays, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease even in one small part of one Member State has very rapid and grave effects on the Community as a whole. The loss of considerable numbers of animals as a result of the slaughter of whole herds and the profound disquiet and insecurity felt in society as a whole in the countries affected and also throughout the other parts of Europe, meant great financial loss in the affected areas, not only for farming, but also for the economy as a whole and tourism in particular. The control of disease can today be understood no longer as merely a means of preserving the stock of farm animals or of defending specific commercial interests, but must also take into account the population's changed lifestyle, their mobility, and their changed attitudes towards the environment and the protection of animals. With these things in mind, the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease engaged intensively with the whole range of problems associated with epidemics, including their effect on the public and the economy. Whilst we do not need to reinvent the wheel, there is much that we can do better when it comes to limiting risks and minimising damage to the economy, while at the same time taking account of the welfare of animals and the sentiments of the public. This is not just about a few cows and sheep. We are all affected; this is relevant to all of us, and it helps not a bit to make sweeping assertions about who is guilty and who is not. I would also like to unambiguously refute the accusations – and there have been some – levelled at farmers, be it in Great Britain or any other country. What is important is that all imports should be controlled, that plans for emergencies should be kept up to date, and that the Commission should actively involve itself in them without delay. Mass slaughter cannot be a solution, and I wish to put the case for emergency vaccination as being the very least we can do, and, apparently, the best means of getting a speedy grip on the disease and sparing the animals' lives. We all know that meat from vaccinated animals is completely safe and therefore capable of being marketed. I would like to express my gratitude to our rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler. I would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez, who chaired our committee, and also the Commission, and those of its members who were of assistance to us. I trust that you will all now go and enjoy a nice juicy steak!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, alongside enlargement and foreign policy, agriculture and structural policy are the essential priorities for the budget. That is only right and proper, as the European Budget was originally agricultural in character. That has to be borne in mind when considering large areas of the Council's policy. There is something dubious about constantly burdening the European Budget with new Community tasks without stating where the money for these tasks is to come from. As I understand these things, it certainly is not going to be from the agriculture budget! I do not see that it has to be our function to keep national budgets sound by dividing up the work in this way. To that extent, it follows that the amendments taken up by the Council from Parliament's first reading are double-edged. On the one hand, I am glad that the Council has withdrawn 25% of the across-the-board cuts in the lines under heading 1A. On the other, this means, when compared with the draft budget, that we are giving out EUR 200 million, even though the estimated upper limit has a margin of EUR 2.6 billion. This money is not being used where it is needed – as aid that actually generates income. Money has been taken away even from the strengthening of the second pillar that has been called for on all sides. I am on record as favouring the support and development of rural areas, if it gives the people there a long-term home and the money is not wasted on local status symbols or allowed to drain away into national projects with ideological trimmings. As regards the Commission's letter of amendment, I welcome the fact that the Commission has adopted some of Parliament's proposals from the first reading and, in particular that it is not making further cuts to export refunds. It is important for me to again emphasise, in conclusion, that the agriculture budget faces attack on two fronts. On one, the Council is attempting to use the agriculture sector to finance ever more new expenditure, and on the other, redeployment of funds to a second pillar yet to be defined means that farmers are losing out on payments from the first pillar that generate income. Both of these things I regard as unfair and would like to take this opportunity to make this abundantly clear.

 Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, it is undoubtedly a great opportunity to take part in this new debate and also to take the floor under the sub-heading of reform of the common agricultural policy in the context of the 2003 budget. In my view – and this is a view shared by the majority of the Agriculture Committee – the 2003 budget, which is the subject of today's debate, is not the right context in which to discuss reform of the common agricultural policy. Neither is a debate assessing Commissioner Fischler's proposals on the mid-term review on today's agenda. Instead we should focus on the actual budgetary figures for the coming year and here there are two essential points which most definitely require a clear decision from us. Firstly, the Council is proposing a general reduction of 0.8% or 0.6% across all 1a lines, which amounts to a cut of EUR 275 million. Secondly, in the Agriculture Committee, our colleagues from the Greens proposed a drastic cut in export refunds; to be more precise they wanted to reduce all export refunds to zero. Neither of these proposals can be right today. It would send out the wrong signal. Accordingly, in a vote on a proposal tabled by the PPE Group, the Agriculture Committee rejected both proposals by a majority. I am quite happy – and this may be a perfectly sensible course of action – to consider moving funds from the first to the second pillar, but only in the context of a dedicated debate on the mid-term review and on a codecision basis. Every year, to the great delight of the Member States, huge sums of money flow back to them from the agriculture budget. At present, the utilisation rate of the 2002 agriculture budget lines is around 80%. The reality of the situation does indeed support the call for better management and optimal use of agricultural funds. To mention the example of export refunds once more, this is another area where a great deal more could be done. For these reasons we, along with the majority of the Committee on Agriculture, are against anticipating the results of the mid-term review.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we meet this afternoon under the banner of ‘enlargement of the European Union’. The speeches made by Members confirm my belief that we are all agreed on one thing, namely that we want enlargement of the European Union, and we are working at every level to realise this objective in a responsible manner. The timetable is an ambitious one. The end is in sight, although chapters on such things as agriculture and regional policy have yet to be sorted out. Let me, in this context, refer back to yesterday, when farmers from the present Community demonstrated in front of the parliament building. They presented the concerns that they have about their future and demonstrated about the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. What they were concerned about was a fair chance for their businesses, and thus for their families, in the future. What made the greatest impression on me was the solidarity our farmers showed with their counterparts from the future Member States, despite the adverse situation they themselves have been put in by falling prices for milk and cereals. This was for me an appeal for everything possible to be done for the people in the present EU and in the candidate countries not to be left alone with their concerns and needs. So we too have to talk about their problems. Let us take Sapard as our first practical example. The flow of funds here is quite inadequate. They should be kept for agriculture and rural areas. Secondly, the funds that continue to be needed for the development of rural areas must be provided by all the structural policy measures and not just from the common agricultural policy. Thirdly, full harmonisation is absolutely necessary in the internal market. I will stop there and thank you for listening, as there are a few people who have been waiting a very long time already.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening's debate is about something that was the Council's sole request, namely the question of how to introduce transparency and the statistical dimension into the agricultural alcohol sector. I am extraordinarily grateful to our rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, who has made exemplary use of the limited room for manoeuvre available to Parliament. We would, Commissioner, have liked to reject the Commission proposal as a whole, as it took no account whatever of the Council's request. Close cooperation with all concerned parties has enabled the rapporteur to lay before us a genuine compromise on which all of them were able to agree. Thirty years of discussions have now got us to the point where we can give this sector a regulation that provides for the required statistical surveys, and does so primarily within the framework of a simple Council regulation. Secondly, this regulation does not, in essence, call for any statements on aid legislation. Thirdly, it includes industrially produced alcohol, agricultural alcohol's direct competitor. As a matter of urgency, I appeal to the Commission to stop resisting this compromise approach. In the event of a qualified majority in Council, it has previously been the practice for the Commission not to insist on a unanimous vote unless there are legal difficulties, but, in this instance, there is no sound reason to insist on unanimity. The Commission's instruments are perfectly adequate for the purpose of monitoring this sector, in which no distortions of competition occur. Not one of the candidate countries wants to adopt or copy the German model which is the subject of this dispute. If the Commission holds fast to its legal position, then I appeal in equally urgent terms to the Spanish President of the Council. When it comes to the interests of German distillers and the interests of our cultural landscape, I appeal to Mrs Künast, the German Federal Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, to vote on 27 June in such a way as to achieve unanimity in this matter. Throughout long negotiations, Parliament has done everything in its power, and now we are counting on your support.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘mid-term review’ in connection with Agenda 2000 is one of the crucial concepts in current political discussion across Europe. Every one of us has his own personal preferences when it comes to this important topic, as both the discussions in the Agriculture Committee and the number of amendments submitted bear witness. Both rapporteurs deserve a great deal of gratitude for having made very serious attempts at incorporating in their reports, as much as possible, the well-founded concerns of Members of this House. As a basis for the balance sheet, the mid-term review must be an option for the future; in other words, Agenda 2000 must be a valid and binding framework up to 2006. It is on this basis that the common agricultural policy must be developed further. It is quite clear that the situation in a globalised world market means that all tendencies towards regionalisation have to be rejected. Our common agricultural policy has to be planned on a long-term basis and capable of being worked out by anyone, which means that we must not lose sight of the objective of using streamlining as a means of dismantling bureaucracy. The production types society desires are, above all, to be achieved more by incentives and not so much by commands and prohibitions. One major question is that of how we care for rural areas and keep them alive. The efficient promotion of young farmers is indispensable in this. We also want the second pillar to be strengthened, but what, in the area of agriculture, is meant by this? The objective must be to make clear that environmentally friendly services and maintenance of the countryside do not ‘cost nothing’, but maintain an accountable market value. Reliability and competitiveness for the farmers and hence greater freedom for their business operations when their performance is considered as a whole is the first objective. First-rate product quality, no matter what the production type, and the required income from it, is the second. Monitored safety right along the production chain, Commissioner, is our third objective in further development of the common agricultural policy, and it is an indispensable one.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks must go first to Mrs Ayuso González, who has invested the greatest effort in this report, even if we are left to vote on just one amendment. Members who sit on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, with Mrs Ayuso, have disregarded party boundaries in trying to point the Commission proposal in a more balanced direction. By balanced we mean that, as well as agricultural alcohol, which makes up only a part of the alcohol market as a whole, synthetic alcohol must also eventually be the subject of a Common Market Organisation, both types of alcohol being in direct competition with each other. Our demand that this be done was rejected. Secondly, there must be exceptions to the existing regulations in Member States which give state support to the production of agricultural alcohol in order to take account of the need to protect the landscape and environment, safeguard the diversity of species and maintain the structures of smallholdings. I am speaking here with specific reference to the German agricultural alcohol monopoly, which has to date effectively performed the functions I have just mentioned. Minimal state aid, which in the European context is in no way relevant to the Internal Market, is used, particularly in southern Germany, to maintain cultural landscapes with fruit meadows that are of ecological value, and which are cultivated and looked after almost exclusively by smallholders. The result of this policy, which has to date been right and proper, can be seen by you yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, on the steepest slopes of the Black Forest, which are now in bloom. This small remuneration for caring for the landscape is almost an idea from the second pillar, which is widely believed to be in need of reinforcement. This concern, though, has not been taken into account either. Parliament is therefore, in my view, doing the right thing in rejecting the Commission proposal before us, which, moreover, utterly disregarded the Council's original mandate for a simple framework regulation. We have kicked the ball back. I am putting my hopes in the unofficial meeting of agriculture ministers at the end of April, and quite specifically in Mrs Künast. The desirable outcome would be for the Council to take up what Parliament has come up with, which I presume will be decided on tomorrow.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is violation of human rights in Kyrgyzstan, a country supported by us through the central Asian delegation to which I belong. Time is short, so I shall address what seem to me to be two particularly important points. First, when I visited the region, I saw clearly for myself that the people were raring to go and move towards our values. Unlike all the countries which have since joined and will soon join the EU, the countries of central Asia are basically making their own way towards democracy, without the huge amounts in aid being received by other countries. The only aid is TACIS. The European Union is providing Kyrgyzstan with financial and technical assistance in setting up ministries in the agricultural and social sectors. If you just stop to consider the different mentality, the cultural differences, religious differences and their completely different historical development, then you will begin to understand the huge difference between our and the central Asian understanding of democracy. What I mean to say here is that we must be careful not to be too harsh on other countries in our demands for democracy and human rights. Secondly, as partners and friends of central Asia, it is our duty to point out serious scandals in due and proper form, especially as Kyrgyzstan is in receipt of a certain amount of aid from us under the TACIS programme. This European Parliament resolution takes account of the dilemma to which I referred. As I said, on the one hand, a recognition of what are surely difficult circumstances and, on the other, the difficulty in establishing a working democracy which guarantees the involvement of all sections and groups of the population. I should like to make a point of acknowledging what has been achieved so far. However, when it comes to human rights, as Mr Bowis very impressively pointed out, there appears to be more retrogression than progression and I must express my very serious concern here. Human rights and human dignity are the basis of a modern society and a stable democracy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the opportunity to speak on Section III of the 2003 budget, having monitored the report in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on behalf of my group, that of the European People's Party. I therefore want primarily to set out the concerns behind the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's amendments to this report by Mr Färm, whom I will take this opportunity of warmly thanking for his work. Today we are not discussing the 2003 budget, but the budget guidelines which express our fundamental thinking, and I am here to present that of my group in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. For a start, we want, in the first instance, resources from Chapters B1-1 to B1-4 to be capable of being carried over individually to the following year. In the long term, though, we also want compulsory and non-compulsory resources to be able to be carried over, something that presupposes Parliament's right of codecision in agricultural matters. Secondly, we have a further demand with regard to the increase in the flexibility reserves with a view to potential crises and emergencies. Thirdly, even though the majority on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted differently on this point, we are opposed to the introduction of the INPARD programme, which will lead only to a further fragmentation of the resources, demand for which on the part of the candidates for accession has been slack. A supplementary programme of this sort will, moreover, bring only additional bureaucracy in its train. Fourthly, and – for us – most importantly, the 2003 Budget is not to be used to prejudge the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. In this report, we do not want agricultural reform right now. What we need is a further development of European agricultural policy. The resolutions on Agenda 2000 are for us the binding foundation. The agricultural budget must not become a quarry for every kind of desirable commodity, but must set forth a reliable agricultural policy option.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Olsson for his good and critical report, which does a thorough job of highlighting some difficult points. The common concern of us all is, without any ifs and buts, the maximum possible safety of our food, which, though, should also look good and taste good. To produce this food, we need farmers, we need agriculture and we need agro-food production. That is still the case. It is this fact that prescribes the frame of reference in which we are at present working on this own-initiative report. The report rightly highlights a series of shortcomings, no doubt the most serious of which is the appreciable difference in the ways Community legislation is implemented in the absence of any common level of protection. This is where, in my view, the Commission is meant to be able to intervene and should be in a position to do so. The precautionary principle must be adhered to by any means available. Current events in Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate show how important responsible controls are. We must therefore hold fast to the imposition of strict sanctions when binding regulations are not complied with, but I counsel a more cautious approach where a scientific justification has not, to date, been found. I cannot therefore go along with testing for BSE as early as 24 months, with the ban on feeding with leftover food, even if it has been treated in accordance with contemporary scientific knowledge, and, likewise, the idea of slaughtering the whole stock when a case of BSE occurs, which is something I reject. There is an urgent need for more research into comprehensive food safety. We need farmers to be well-trained, good managers, motivated and – which is most important – respected by society, and these farmers need a fair price for what they produce.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having gone through two readings and the conciliation procedure, the report on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs now prescribes the open declaration, and the Commission has to produce a proposal for a positive list for feedingstuff ingredients by the end of 2002. Both these points had been at the core of Parliament's concerns, but had initially been rejected by the Council. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report is the very model of successful legislative work by Parliament and the Council. In spite of all the differences between the political groups, constructive collaboration made it possible to draw up points that were important to us members of Parliament's agricultural committee, and the final result was a positive one thanks to circumspect negotiations in the conciliation procedure, guided by our Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, whom I would like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking. This was the right step in the right direction. Not only was it possible for Parliament to see its two core concerns accepted, but the Council also had positive elements to contribute. The possibility of a +
 15% tolerance margin for feedingstuff ingredients is something I see as acceptable, in that the manufacturer must state the exact percentages at the customer’s request. Equally in line with good practice is an evaluation report after three years and, if need be, adjustment of the tolerance margin in the light of scientific and technical developments. It would be desirable if we could make greater future use of the co-decision procedure on CAP matters and continue to work together as constructively. Whatever our successes, I would like to conclude with the single warning that good European rules are of no use unless they are monitored. The BSE and dioxin crises do not in some way reflect faults in European regulation; they were, rather, the result of criminal and questionable practices, which we must counter with determination and in new ways.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are handling the subject of ‘Protection of animals during transport’. This is a long-running issue, and I unreservedly support the report Mr Maat has presented. We all know that there are already several directives on this in the European Union, and legislation to transpose it in the Member States. We are all in favour of comprehensive animal protection and opposed to methods of transport which inflict needless suffering, particularly on animals destined for slaughter. Were all these positive laws to be transposed and followed up everywhere, this debate would not be necessary. That is, however, not the case. Pictures of unacceptable transport conditions provide repeated evidence of this. We should, though, not lose sight of the fact that there are a few good things to report on this area. There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection. The idea of slaughter in the immediate vicinity of the place of origin is also widely being put into practice. Slaughter as close to the farm as possible is something I greatly support. Modern methods of preservation make the export of meat even to distant areas thoroughly feasible. We are right to demand feeding and watering breaks during the transportation of animals. We will also have to give future consideration to how to minimise stress to the animals when being unloaded or reloaded before and after these breaks. We could certainly aim to have the vehicles transporting animals to slaughter equipped in such a way that the animals could remain on board the vehicle during short breaks and be provided for there. Transport, space, the way in which the vehicles are driven, ventilated and heated, loading and unloading procedures have, if they are made suitable, the greatest effect on improving the protection of animals. This report makes its contribution to that and I ask for it to be supported across this House.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises, the present Paulsen report on the health rules governing animal by-products not intended for human consumption has its place under the broad and essential umbrella for the protection of food safety and animal health. The term ‘by-products’ as used here refers primarily to meat and bone meal. In its proposal, the Commission formulated a conditional ban, in other words a graduated ban, on the use of meat and bone meal in feeds and fertilisers. Mrs Paulsen has developed very effectively the ideas presented by the Commission. The division into three categories is to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Commission only authorises the use of Category 1 meal in animal feed if it has been sterilised for 20 minutes at a temperature of 133°C and a pressure of 3 bar. The Commission proposal, as amended in committee, is therefore consistent with the demand of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE for strict separation of animal waste products into those that are basically fit for human consumption and those that come from infected and sick animals. Healthy waste products from the abattoir are valuable providers of protein which we should not discard. Omnivores really will eat everything. We should not try to re-educate them. As far as ruminants are concerned, it goes without saying that meat and bone meals are taboo. We need responsibly applied and controlled technology for the production and processing of meat and bone meal, and we need still more research. If we proceed on the basis of this regulation and transpose it in our Member States, we shall have built firm foundations from which we can go on to guarantee the safety of our foodstuffs and to ensure that our consumers are well supplied with good food.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has responded very quickly, and I should also like to thank Mr Adams, who has performed sterling work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. My thanks are also due to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. As we know, the legislation on chemical substances, the Water Framework Directive and the Directive on plant-protection products already refer to certain dangerous substances, defining and categorising them. The present proposal for a resolution and the list deriving from it must ultimately be brought into line with these existing directives. Because of its far-reaching economic and legal consequences for agriculture, and for all other sectors of the economy too, the Commission should therefore ensure that the necessary process of identifying these priority hazardous substances is based on hard scientific facts. It is imperative to act on a sound scientific basis rather than on the basis of suspicion. The Water Framework Directive has given us a time frame that extends to the year 2004. We now have a broad consensus on this issue throughout the EU. We need not be carried away by our emotions. Zero emissions is not a realistic aim. We need clarity, built on sound scientific foundations, if we are to take the right action. Water, ladies and gentlemen, is one of our most important and most sensitive assets. Let us not forget that.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the present proposal for the amendment of the Regulation establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops, the Commission is pursuing the aim of encouraging environmental agriculture by means of the cultivation of fodder legumes on land set aside. This, however, is only to be possible for holdings which, with their production, are taking part in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and which, in effect, are organic holdings. This is where our criticism begins, and for the most part the Council also sees it the same way. I want to emphasise this at this point. We are calling for not only organic holdings to be permitted to cultivate legumes on land set aside, but, against the background of BSE and foot-and-mouth, all livestock holdings. In this way, the many livestock holdings could receive a small compensation for the sometimes truly dramatic financial losses caused by BSE and foot-and-mouth. At least, however, in addition to the organic holdings, holdings should be considered which are participating in the agri-environment programmes, that is to say holdings which, within the framework of Regulation 1257/99, are participating in national environment programmes approved by the committee. The argument put forward by the committee in this connection, that the instrument of set aside would be given up with our amendments, is surely incomprehensible. It is clear to every farmer affected by BSE and foot-and-mouth and who is participating in these support measures that the EU is giving no new cause for celebration here. Rather, he will be grateful for it as a very clever interpretation of the little room to manoeuvre which remains to us in the present miserable situation for livestock holdings. Secondly, the committee itself reports that the desired restoration of the soil’s fertility will be achieved by the cultivation of fodder legumes. It is incomprehensible why only organically farmed holdings should profit from this recycling. After the animal meal fodder ban, it just makes sense to encourage the cultivation of highly protein-rich legumes. We will need far more of them than we are at present producing. The introduction of soya may pay off. If, however, we are taking sustainable agriculture seriously, we must take a step forwards here.

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the crisis in European farming is already bad enough, thanks to BSE. Foot-and-mouth – because it is such a highly infectious disease – is the last straw. It is hardly surprising that farmers – but not only farmers – are calling for rigorous action to be taken and, with your permission, I should like to ask a few questions about this. First: do you know the exact extent of the epidemic at the latest count? Secondly: farmers are anxious to know if the foot-and-mouth vaccination has been abolished once and for all. What are you thinking of doing here, given the current circumstances, for stock in general and for particularly valuable animals, such as animals on stud farms? Thirdly: transportation is once again centre stage. Is the transportation of animals and meat within the European Parliament being jointly controlled? And if so, how? What sanctions are to be applied in the event of infringement? Fourthly: all imports of animals and animal products into the Community are a source of concern. Argentina can supply what customers want: beef which is guaranteed free from BSE. That is something at least. But, as you said, they have foot-and-mouth disease. What specific protection and what safety measures have you introduced here, Commissioner? And fifthly: my last point – and it is an important point – concerns the cost of foot-and-mouth. Who pays what and what funds do you think the EU should provide? Is the Commission willing to learn from experience with the BSE crisis and act now, rather than just react as and when it has to in order to contain the foot-and-mouth epidemic? For me this means that the Commission itself should take action as well as coordinating national measures. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the Brussels part-session two weeks ago we voted on the ‘railways package’ and agreed that this was a great achievement for Parliament and for rail freight in the European Community. Tomorrow we will be voting on the Savary report at second reading on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system. Approximation of technical standards is an essential and important step if we are to facilitate safe cross-border rail freight. At first reading, all sides put a lot of hard work and effort into this very technical Commission proposal, and I would sincerely like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Savary, today. All that effort has paid off, as, with just a few exceptions, the Council has accepted all Parliament's amendments. The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats is pleased to see its views largely reflected in the amendments accepted by the Council, which also explains why we are not tabling any further amendments now, at second reading. I did, in fact, table one amendment in committee that was adopted by Parliament at first reading but not subsequently accepted by the Council. It was three votes short of being adopted. This was the stipulation that maintenance and approval of warning systems should be carried out by external and independent certification bodies. Apart from quite understandable economic interests in many Member States, this amendment has to be seen against the background of the many serious rail incidents which may have been caused by inadequate checks. These approvals and checks were in the past and to some extent continue to be carried out by the rail operators themselves, rather than by independent third parties. When this was discussed in committee all sides, including the Commission, showed great understanding on this point. The wording that has now been adopted for Article 18 and Annex VII to some extent takes account of our concerns, but we are not completely happy with this as things stand. The Commission's undertaking to include proper independent approval and maintenance of rail systems in the railways package is sufficient for us to speed this otherwise excellent compromise on its way without tabling any further amendments in the plenary session. Nevertheless, when we examine future rail dossiers we will be watching very carefully to see if the Commission has honoured its promises.

 Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in common with the vast majority of Members of this House, I too believe that the outcome of the Conciliation Procedure on the reports concerning the railway package has enabled us to take a big step towards opening up the market in international freight transport. The reports by Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski set the right tone. The separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management is pre-requisite to the liberalisation of the European railways. I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all concerned for the difficult, but ultimately productive, work undertaken within the Conciliation Committee. As is apparent from all the other areas that have already undergone liberalisation, competition has a positive effect on the area concerned. In freight transport, the advantages are tangible and plain for all to see. If the European railways can improve their competitive position vis-à-vis
 other modes of transport, especially road transport, this will have a positive impact on the environment and will also help solve the serious problems attending road transport. In order to achieve these goals, and in fact this is logical, competition must not stop at respective national borders. It must be able to flourish on a Community-wide basis. Only in this way will the railways become a real alternative. Parliament has scored a major success in achieving this goal, all be it with transitional periods. The same conditions must apply to passenger transport as apply to freight transport. The problems emanating from the other modes of transport – road transport for example – are not just caused by heavy goods vehicles, but also by passenger transport, of course. The railway will only be able to win back shares in the transport market if it becomes a viable alternative, and what that means these days is an international outlook, quality of service and customer orientation. If the railway sets itself this major challenge, it has everything to gain, and all of us with it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Paulsen’s report on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition deals with an important subject, which, like all important subjects, is highly controversial. Irrespective of whether we eventually reach agreement, let me take this opportunity to thank all of the honourable Members whose constructive preparatory work has brought us to the present point in this discussion. Speaking for my group today as the draftsperson of the dissenting opinion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should like to make five points. Firstly, the new proposal which was introduced by the Commission in December 1999 and which forms the basis of Mrs Paulsen's report seeks to change the system completely less than a year after the introduction of the existing directive in April 1999. The report abandons the distinction between feedstuffs, feed materials and feed additives. The new directive that will be put to the vote today does not materially alter the quality of animal feed in any way, since the proposed limit values applicable to the final feed product are the same as those in the present directive. The same is true of dioxin. What we are discussing so fastidiously is not going to be changed here. Moreover, in my eyes a crime is a crime! Secondly, for farmers, who are, of course, the producers of primary feed materials, there will in fact be a change, because in future they will have to destroy considerably higher percentages of their feed materials. What we want is a comprehensive, prudent and practicable arrangement for all concerned. The question whether the text we are now being asked to adopt is appropriate, especially from a food safety or macroeconomic point of view, is extremely debatable. I believe it is not. From my own conversations, however, I know that I am not speaking for a majority of the House on this particular point. That being the case, it is important at the present juncture to make emphatically clear that compensation for these additional losses and shortfalls suffered by farmers, to which Mrs Paulsen rightly referred, is essential, that we must create directives to regulate this and that we must reflect on how we should deal with these things at the WTO negotiations and how we should regard imported products which contain such undesirable substances. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the overall objective of the railway package under discussion here today is fast liberalisation of the European railways. As you know, we in the PPE are calling for this in all areas needed to complete the single market, wherever healthy competition can replace hand-me-down monopolies. Only comprehensive liberalisation will allow the necessary progress to be made so that the railway, as a carrier, has the qualitative and quantitative capacity to provide services and integrate with other carriers. The Commission texts on developing railway undertakings, on licensing railway undertakings and on allocating railway infrastructure capacity are a step in the right direction in this respect. My fellow member, Georg Jarzembowski, has earned my unstinting support for his efforts to bring about a self-contained railway package and would like to thank him for his work and his excellent report. What is important to me in all this is that, when management and infrastructure are separated, investments in the infrastructure are examined closely and duly compensated. Liberalisation will only be accepted if it results in real advantages and consumers need not fear for their safety. From this point of view, we must be sure to keep a firm hold on strict conditions when licensing railway undertakings. As far as the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity is concerned, we must ensure that there is non-discriminatory access. I do not deny that flexible regulations governing access to the grid have caused a number of problems in the energy sector. But I still think it is the best market economy approach and that also applies to the railways. We should not just talk about a common Europe, we should have the courage of our convictions and do something about it.

Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Savary, and all the members involved for their excellent and constructive cooperation on this difficult, purely technical subject. The number of proposed amendments tabled, including here in plenary, shows how important this issue is for Europe, which is why I can also praise the Commission for addressing the subject of the interoperability of conventional trains as well as of high-speed trains. I think it is a pity that few Member States have transposed the interoperability directive with regard to high-speed trains and I call on the Commission to exert pressure to prevent the loss of valuable time which is costing the railways in terms of market shares and competition. The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned. The aim of the directive – as with high-speed trains – is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the Union runs as smoothly as possible and to give candidate countries really exact specifications so that through traffic is also guaranteed after enlargement. Interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport. Better services, greater comfort, less travelling time, increased safety and possibly also lower prices. The harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways. Both together, interoperability and liberalisation, are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market. I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good, common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that. This applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the TSIs, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise. Nonetheless, – and we in the group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats continue to believe that we are right here – generally-worded social aspects do not belong in this purely technical directive, even if the Commission and the Council may think otherwise. We are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out TSIs. Including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage. Finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot. In short, our group is against any elements which are counterproductive when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient European railway, as outlined above. Allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again; I am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you had a wonderful weekend and that you were able to relax somewhere in Europe in our fantastically beautiful – and, above all, undamaged – agricultural landscape, which is responsibly and lovingly tended by our farmers. It is in this spirit of optimism that we can begin this debate on our report on the prices for agricultural products in 2000/2001. In the past, this report was always the subject of fierce debates on farm incomes. The decisions made under Agenda 2000 established many principles, not necessarily always for the best as far as agriculture is concerned. This Commission proposal, too, contains a series of points which will again lead to a reduction in farmers’ incomes. In my report I make my opposition to this absolutely clear. The Commission is proposing to further reduce the additional charges on the intervention prices for cereals in two stages and then to fix them. The Commission’s proposal to reduce the monthly increments would mean another substantial deterioration in farm incomes. In this context, we also reject the Commission’s plan to make the intervention criteria stricter. If the minimum moisture content threshold were lowered this would reduce the compass of the intervention safety net and increase the proportion of the cereal crop which is, in principle, excluded from intervention. A third point – and here, judging by recent press releases, the Council appears to be coming round to the Agriculture Committee’s point of view – relates to Mrs Schreyer’s proposal to cut the agriculture budget by EUR 300 million per year in favour of the EU's foreign policy, despite the fact that additional money has still not been made available to remedy the extensive forest damage. At this stage I should like to state clearly once again that however important the EU's commitment to the Balkans is, the agriculture budget does not constitute an inexhaustible supply of funds which we can use to finance all our other desirable policies. The agriculture budget is neither a self-service shop nor a high-yielding dairy cow. Mrs Schreyer says that, of course, the EUR 300 million will not come out of direct support, but that is irrelevant because in the second pillar of agricultural policy too – that is, promoting the development of rural areas and stewardship of the countryside – each and every euro is necessary and well-spent. Our farmers are already experiencing uncertainty of a kind which ought to make us stop and think. Structural change is not, in itself, a bad thing; it is much more the consequence of a huge improvement in training and therefore in knowledge, skills and technology. But if an increasing number of farms are going out of business, farms which we have classified as viable from a political point of view, and if farmers are complaining about their workload, which is becoming unbearable, then something is wrong, and perhaps something is also wrong with our policy. It is our job to put in place tangible and enduringly reliable or – with your permission I will borrow a word from our definition of modern land management – sustainable framework conditions and not to turn the screws – including the tiny ones – even further. After all, we have already tightened the large ones as far as they will go. We need to change fundamental aspects of our agriculture policy for the long term! We need a new vision for our farmers which is forward-looking and geared towards future needs. At this point I should like to ask the Commission whether, and to what extent, it is prepared to accept the amendments we adopted unanimously in committee. I am obviously asking because there is the possibility of referring this back to the committee if the Commission is not prepared to take on board points which are important to Parliament. I refer in particular to the moisture content of cereals and the monthly increments. On the other hand, I recognise that the budget year begins on 1 July and that a referral back to the committee might mean that the Council would not be able to decide in time, which would again be disadvantageous for agriculture. That is what I want to prevent at all costs. I started the report by reminding you of the beauty of the European agricultural landscape. I should like to finish with the sentence: ‘Food and drink hold body and soul together’. Let us not forget this, even in our political considerations and decisions!

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now some three months since Hurricane Lothar caused devastating damage to forests in Europe, and in particular France and Baden-Württemberg. In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres. This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30% lower timber prices. Just the cost of remedying the damage in Baden-Württemberg, the area for which I can speak as the delegate, runs to about DM 1.5 billion, of which DM 300 million are needed simply for reforestation. However, Hurricane Lothar is not a problem specific to Baden-Württemberg. France and other EU States have also been greatly affected. Nevertheless, the Commission has so far refused to make additional budgetary allocations available and prefers to cite, in this instance represented by Mrs Schreyer, the fact that final agreement has already been reached in the European Parliament on Budget 2000 and that the requirement for additional funds should be covered by the Member State in question from the funds already allocated. However, the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given. I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that, only a few days later, she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR 300 million for the EU Balkan commitment, which is undoubtedly important, would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it, and this includes forest owners. I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications. Tidying up, storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work. Commissioner, I know what I am talking about. I am a farmer. I have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and I have seen the state our private woods are in. We were able to put things right ourselves but, by and large, this is not the case for all areas, all persons, all communities. You can see that. But that this is done quickly and efficiently and, above all, is sustained long term is an ecological necessity. During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Dr Fischler, indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures for rural development. He indicated, as you have today, Commissioner, that you are willing to give consideration to, to help ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that compared to many areas of the earth, the European economic and social model is as successful as it is, because, in the past, we have developed an economically viable and environmentally friendly transport policy, with sensible general conditions for employees. By way of example, I would just like to mention the driving and rest periods for road traffic and working periods in the transport sector. On the one hand, this European transport policy is based on us having already dealt with the different national rules in the transport sector or on us being in the process of dealing with them, and thus creating an integrated market in the transport sector too. As an example from recent years I would mention the opening of the national rail networks to non-discriminatory use for all railway companies in the Union for freight services from 2006 
or 2007. I could, alternatively, give another example of the creation of the Single European Sky from 31 December 2004. On the other hand, the European transport policy is based on having come to terms with the thinking and action behind national infrastructure networks and having created and expanded a trans-European transport network within the Union. In this vein, we adopted the largest revision of the trans-European transport network two weeks ago and thereby getting to grips with the Union of Fifteen’s transport infrastructure and adopting 30 priority projects for the Union of Twenty-Five. I am assuming that the new Member States will quickly implement the European regulations in the transport sector, if they have not already done so, in order that the internal market in transport may become a reality in all areas of the European Union. I hope that together we will be able to press ahead with and further develop the European transport policy in the next Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.

 Mr President, I just want to ask that, in the letter to the Council, you inform them that an error has crept in to the German version of the Common Position. In our negotiations with them, we succeeded in prevailing upon the Council to replace the term ‘high-speed sea routes’ by the term ‘motorways of the sea’, as we also want to promote slower ferries as well as high-speed ones. I therefore ask that the communication to the Council should make reference to the linguistic error that has found its way into the German version as regards the term ‘motorway of the sea’. I believe that view to be shared by the House as a whole.

 Mr President, Commissioner – Viviane – ladies and gentlemen, in view of the fact that it is now a little late and there are hardly any spectators present – apart from a well-known representative of a railway company – I will be brief. I think that Parliament can be proud that we have overcome the hesitant position of the Council with the results of the conciliation procedure on the second railway package and have created a new, practical European dimension for the development of railway companies in the Union. With the amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC, all railway companies will now be given non-discriminatory access to the rail networks of all the Member States for cross-border freight traffic as of 1 January 2006 and – this is Parliament’s achievement – for freight traffic within them as early as 1 January 2007. At the same time, the Commission, Parliament and the Council recommend an opening up of the network also for cross-border passenger traffic for the year 2010. Commissioner, we are grateful to you for the third railway package, as put before us by the Commission. I personally am not sure whether it is necessary to regulate quality control for freight services – which I believe should be left to the market – and compensation for delays and so on in railway transport – aviation is rather different from railways. However, we will do this in the next round. In any event, we are in favour of the opening up of passenger traffic, on which we agree, Commissioner, and also on the fact that we need a European driving licence, so that we can have a European labour market for railway employees too. I would like to go on to say, however, that, with the new Directive on railway safety in the Community, we will for the first time be developing a European safety standard for railways, that we will be overcoming the small-state approach to questions of safety and will in fact be introducing rules across the Union for a uniformly high level of safety for private and public railway companies. I believe that this will be a major step towards a European internal market. I regard Mrs Ainardi’s amendment on interoperability as important precisely because we will be able more rapidly and better to coordinate and accelerate technical specification work for rolling stock in other parts of the railway system. Finally, I also believe that with the regulation establishing the European Railway Agency we will have created an important institution which will be committed in practice both to European safety standards and also to the rapid processing of the technical specifications for interoperability. Let me conclude with that. I believe that, by means of the conciliation procedure, we have created the right – that is to say, favourable – parameters for ensuring that in the railway sector too there is a European internal market and, now that we have created the parameters, it is now up to the railway companies – whether public or private, on that we are neutral – to exploit, at a high level of safety, the opportunities in the market and at the end of the day to achieve our common objective of reviving rail transport in the European Union and shifting as much freight as possible from road to rail, so that our policy can make sense both environmentally and commercially. We have thus taken a major step towards a reasonable modal split between future transport providers and a good new opportunity for railway companies in the Union.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, as the chairman of the non-standing committee for the improvement of safety at sea, I would like to extend warm thanks to the members of the committee and to the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, for the extraordinarily sensible way in which they conducted their deliberations and for their excellent report. The committee worked consistently in an excellent atmosphere, and everyone attempted to resolve the problems in a sensible manner. Many thanks. My special thanks, obviously, go to the staff of the secretariat, under the leadership of Mr Darmis, without whose extremely professional administrative support the rapid but, at the same time, careful work of the committee, including the important trip to Barcelona, would not have been possible. The hearing of numerous experts with various backgrounds, representatives of the Commission, the European Agency for Maritime Safety, the Irish presidency of the Council, the General Secretary of the IMO and, not least, the acting Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, in my opinion provided the committee with a broad foundation for its recommendations and assessments. We once again investigated maritime accidents subsequent to those involving the Erika 
and the Prestige 
and mainly concentrated on the statutory measures introduced since then at European level to improve safety at sea and their implementation in the Member States. Of the 56 conclusions, I would like to emphasise four of a general nature. I will not go into the details. I believe, however, that four conclusions are so important that they should be emphasised. The Spanish authorities have successfully stopped the leak of oil from the wreck of the Prestige 
and submitted a timetable for the further pumping away of the oil out of it, so that additional harm to the environment and fishing should be avoided. We still have the problem that the waste extracted from the sea in the last few months and in the last few years must be carefully recycled, but that is a special problem. Secondly, in our opinion, the Spanish courts should urgently bring forward the judicial proceedings in respect of the Prestige
 accident and change the conditions applicable to the captain, so that he can return home until they start. Thirdly, the new regulations resolved on with the ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’ packages of legislation are essentially the right ones for achieving a substantial improvement in safety at sea. Fourthly – and this is the key point – there is still inadequate transposition of the safety regulations into the national law of some Member States, and therefore into reality. Accordingly, Madam Vice-President, we support the Commission in its investigations into the implementation measures, in particular with regard to the question of the provision of emergency resting places and crisis response places. Commissioner, stick to it, put pressure on the Member States, and this House will support you!

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Cocilovo, my group does, of course, endorse your report, in which you support the proposal of the Commission to review the Directive on the road toll fees and propose major improvements. We are also glad that the committee, contrary to the rapporteur’s original inclinations, has not proposed the introduction of road toll fees for private motor vehicles by way of Community law, because I believe – and in this the Commission is completely right – that whether a country wishes to introduce road toll fees for private motor vehicles should be left up to that country on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity. In my own country, Germany, there would be no reason for it, because when we consider what the driver is already paying for fuel and vehicle taxes, he is to a large extent paying for the costs of roads, indeed more than the costs of the roads would require. So we are glad that the question of toll fees for private motor vehicles is dealt with under European law. Secondly, we support the Commissioner in her struggle – –which is what it is – in the Council for a clear commitment of purpose, because it makes no sense to increase the road toll fees in order to improve road maintenance and expansion, if as a result the increased revenues are added to the general tax pool and go to finance no doubt very reasonable training or cultural measures or other policies. If goods vehicles are to be subject to higher toll fees the revenues from them must be returned to the transport sector. I would like to end by raising two questions, and I can guarantee that we will be discussing them again in the second round. We were indeed all in agreement – even the rapporteur has referred to it – that we cannot increase the road toll fees without limit, because the increase of toll fees would lead to the death of the transport economy and the economy as a whole. We cannot just regard the goods vehicle as the cash cow of Europe. There must be limits to how far we can increase road toll fees, because otherwise we will harm jobs and economic growth. For that reason, there are two questions on which there is certainly a need for further discussion. Up to now, we generally took the view that it was possible to tax goods vehicles in favour of other transport players in the spirit of cross-finance in the Alps and the Pyrenees, because this territory, so to speak, imposed a need for particularly expensive transport facilities, for example for rail. Now, this provides a basis for permitting cross-finance in other sensitive areas also. I must warn against leaving the door open here. Speaking for my home city of Hamburg, I can say immediately that it is a sensitive area with a high volume of transport, so that we could indeed impose higher toll fees in Hamburg, Cologne and elsewhere. We must therefore think very carefully about where we will apply cross-finance as an instrument. The second issue has to do with external costs; let me give you an example of what I mean. If toll fees are increased because of blockages on many sections of the Trans-European network, we would be rewarding the Member States who fail to build the necessary infrastructure. They would get more money if they do not expand. That cannot be right! So let us carefully consider these questions at second reading.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mrs Maes, Mr Stockmann, Commission staff, ladies and gentlemen, we are indeed a cosy huddle of experts. My group endorses the rapporteur's recommendation that the Common Position be adopted. We would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work with the Council behind the scenes. It is important to bring this matter to a conclusion. Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, I think it is essential that in reforming the Slot Regulation, we agree on the new definition of slots as usage rights. A slot only entitles carriers to use airport facilities for takeoffs and landings at specified dates and times. These usage rights do not represent any kind of property right, neither to airports, nor to air carriers. Slots are a general good. That is the key issue. I am most grateful to you, Madam Vice-President, for stating that you will endeavour to present a revised version of the new Regulation by November. I personally believe – and here, I follow the line adopted by the rapporteur in his report – that it is essential to make it very clear that slots do not belong to the airport or to airlines, which means that they cannot be traded. We can devise all sorts of trading rules and amendments, but let me say this: the British Airways slots at Heathrow are not British Airways property that can be traded for generous sums of money. The slots are a general good – in Frankfurt, Paris or at any other airport. I am most grateful that the Council, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to strengthen the role and independence of coordinators, for the coordinators' role is to ensure the effective use of airports and airspace in the common interest, not to create advantages or disadvantages for the airlines or airports. The aim must be to ensure the best possible use of the airports for airlines and passengers in economic and environmental terms. I am therefore grateful to Mr Stockmann for concluding this matter successfully before the end of this legislative period. We should all vote in favour of his report tomorrow.

 Mr President, in light of the time saved, please allow me to make two comments: firstly, Madam Vice-President, you are quite right. It is essential to take grandfather rights into account in relation to slots, but this must not lead to slots being bought and sold. Secondly, we are pleased that Mr Minetta is coming and we are pleased that the talks about common airspace are progressing, but I would remind you of the fabled proverb: ‘Beware of Greeks bearing gifts!’ It also applies to the Americans. As one of the longest-serving Members of this House, let me say that it was a pleasure working with you, especially on the issue of air travel, over such a long period. Many thanks, Madam Vice-President.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it would have been nice if the President-in-Office of the Council could still be here to hear us discuss this but, never mind, we are used to this sort of thing. I would like to start, Madam Vice-President, by reiterating that you have taken a very great deal of trouble in submitting a very well thought-out proposal. Setting up the van Miert Group was a very good idea, and the Commission proposal is influenced by what it produced and you revised. For that, many thanks; especial thanks, too, to my colleague Mr Bradbourn, whose report is the result of very careful work. As it stands, the report is not entirely what he would have liked to see, as a fortuitous majority in the Committee pushed through very substantial amendments to Annex III, but perhaps we can sort that out tomorrow. There are just three major points that I want to discuss. My group is in agreement with the list of priority projects being extended to 30. I now hear that the Council has suddenly decided that it no longer wants the 30th. It has to decide, then, what it actually wants. Although we are prepared to extend the list by adding, for example, the project for a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt, we want a more precise definition of the projects in some areas covered by Annex III. This is the subject of a number of amendments, and I hope that the Council will accept them. My group is, at present, prepared to keep the list to 30 projects, as we know that, according to Article 156(2), decisions on trans-European networks cannot be taken in opposition to the Member States, so it makes no sense to make major additions to the list in the short time available. This means that we are taking the same line as Commissioner de Palacio, and I hope that the other groups will do likewise. Madam Vice-President, we very much welcome the idea of motorways of the sea; I see the advancement of short-distance transport by sea, especially ferries, as very important. As a mode of transport, it saves a great deal of energy, is highly environmentally friendly, and will tend to take the load off road and rail corridors. However, Madam Vice-President, we are behind the rapporteur. Motorways of the sea must not be used as an excuse to inject state funds in the form of subsidies, with the state even buying ships in order to compete with private enterprise. That goes against the whole idea of trans-European networks, the object of which was always to improve infrastructure so that business can use it. Using them to extend it is not acceptable. I think we will sort things out with the Council in a sensible way, but there is very little time in which to reach an agreement. If, by Monday evening, the Council has not precisely defined what its interests are, and thereby enabled us to agree on the details, nothing will happen by 1 May; the fact is that Parliament will not simply abandon the good positions incorporated into the Bradbourn report simply because the Council is obstinately sticking to its own. Codecision is at issue here. Both sides have to give way.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, speaking on behalf of my group, I wish to extend warm thanks to the three rapporteurs. It is rather sad that there is nobody here – no journalists, no members of the public – but that is how things are. The three rapporteurs have done an excellent job of dealing with substantial legislative initiatives, and we are pleased with the progress that has been made. I would like to thank Mr Clegg for having enabled us to come to an agreement with the Council on a joint regulation protecting our airlines against subsidisation and unfair pricing practices. Both of us – indeed, I believe, all of us – agree that this is not so much about the use of weaponry as about stocking up an ammunition box, one that we hope will enable us to prevent unfair subsidisation in America, among other places. We can in any case, if a stop is not put to it, threaten them with a whole ammunition depot full of sanctions against their airlines and to the benefit of our own. While we have no desire to restrict competition, we do want to have an ammunition box for the sake of fair competition at global level. Mr Dhaene has done well to improve the practical details of the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security. I think that Parliament and the Council will endorse the Commission’s approach, which involves adapting the highly stringent rules that we need, post-9/11, to smaller airports in a practicable and affordable way, so I am grateful to Mr Dhaene for his practical solution. Contrary to what might sometimes be believed, we are not just engaged in enacting meaningless laws. Mr Nicholson probably had the toughest brief, that of insurance requirements, which is the most expensive issue to deal with. On these, insurance premiums depend, and they can get very expensive. I think we have managed to reconcile both the passengers’ interest in having a proper and high level of insurance cover and the airlines’ interest in premiums that remain affordable. The amounts involved represent a fair compromise. It is, I think, a very fine thing that Mr Nicholson has managed to take the right approach to gliders, too. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my thanks to Vice-President De Palacio. We are engaged – as we need to be – in adopting every kind of legislation relating to air transport by the end of this legislative period. One might say that a majority in this House, drawn from every political group, is united in favouring the adoption of these practical rules for really safe air transport, so, on behalf of my own group, let me thank the rapporteurs and the Vice-President.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, that was not sufficient. I will repeat that for your benefit, Mr President-in-Office: your statement was inadequate. The Chairman of the Committee asked a specific question as to whether the Council agrees with the description of the ‘Quick Start’ list as, in essence, a personal list drawn up by the Council, but as not binding upon Parliament. You have failed to answer that question, and I find that extremely sad. You embarked on a major statement about why the ‘Quick Start’ list is necessary, but you did not address the way in which this ‘Quick Start’ list gives the impression – which your speech, in my view, reinforces – that you want Parliament to be kept out of decisions about which projects are to have priority. We did try to help you out of your difficulties, making it clear to you that the TEN projects’ Annex III, the priority projects, is a matter for our joint decision, and that the Council cannot draw up its own special list from among these priority projects, effectively saying that, of the 30 projects, it finds this one and that one and the other one the most attractive, and that it is now deciding to start with those. You subsequently attempted to defuse the issue by saying that the choice was made on the basis of readiness for work to begin or the availability of funding. Indeed so: which projects are tackled and when is not a decision for the Council; it must be decided in accordance with the criteria in Annex III as to which projects are ready to be built, which have received planning permission and which are capable of being funded. So I will again ask you to state unambiguously whether the ‘Quick Start’ list is binding in law, and if so, on whom; or whether you have attempted to use it to circumvent Parliament’s and the Council’s right of joint decision on the priority projects. For my part, and on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we will not let this pass. We will not allow the Council to use a so-called ‘Quick Start’ list as a means of unilaterally disregarding Parliament’s rights.

 Mr President, speaking personally, I wish to repudiate the attacks made on Mrs de Palacio. Not in any way did she attempt to exert negative influence on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism; on the contrary, she offered help in bringing the trans-European networks dossier to a conclusion, and that was very valuable. What I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, though, is whether he has nothing to say to us. Are our questions so unimportant that he is unwilling to give us an answer?

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I really cannot endorse most of the previous speaker’s comments, especially her concerns about the Agency’s competences. You know, if we look back at the past – the Erika
, the Prestige
 – the Member States really have shown that they are incapable of resolving the problems promptly on their own. We need the European Maritime Safety Agency, and we also need an expansion of its competences. This House has always thrown its weight behind the Agency. Let me recall just one particular instance: in autumn, when the Council was about to cut the posts for the Agency, which was being set up at that time, we promptly reversed this measure at the first reading of the budget. Madam Vice-President, I too believe that the rapporteur’s proposals – namely to provide the Agency with the requisite, which means genuinely adequate, financial resources to charter ships, equipment, and so on, and deliver a specialised pollution response service swiftly in the event that this is requested by a coastal state – mean that the Agency must indeed be provided with sufficient resources. Of course, I am slightly sceptical as well. We should not be overloading the Agency with general threat prevention tasks. The European Maritime Safety Agency’s primary objective is to ensure a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships within the Community, not to undertake general prevention of terrorism. We must be very careful to ensure that we do not raise expectations which the Agency cannot fulfil. Madam Vice-President, now that we have embarked on new territory – or waters – by establishing the Agency, we have called for it to draw up a detailed work programme swiftly. This is because we want to discuss the work programme with you, Madam Vice-President, since responsibility for the Agency lies with you as the Commissioner. The Agency does not have a separate structure or identity; instead, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that it operates efficiently. I have no doubt that you will do the right thing, Madam Vice-President, but we must discuss the matter in detail, for we cannot overload the Agency with tasks and then fail to provide it with the requisite personnel and resources. This would create difficulties for the Agency. We therefore need to discuss precisely which tasks it must perform, which tasks it can perform, and which resources we will need for this process. I wish to endorse the comments of one of the previous speakers. Madam Vice-President, I would be pleased if you could tell us this evening how quickly the Agency will be able to relocate. We were always gratified that the Agency started work in Brussels because the work was urgent and necessary. However, given that the Heads of State or Government have already tinkered around for a long time and trawled around various locations in Europe, and have now decided in favour of Lisbon, we do not want the next two years to be taken up with renting space and getting the premises ready before the real work can begin. Perhaps you can give us some indication of a possible timetable, because we want the move to Lisbon to take place swiftly so that an effective Agency is up and running very soon. I would like to make one final comment. In my previous life, I was a judge, and I think we must be cautious in what we say about the captain of the Prestige
. I too have the impression that he should have the opportunity to leave Spain in order to live elsewhere in the internal market, namely in his home country, Greece. However, in a democracy, in a state under the rule of law, there is a separation of powers, and it is not the Spanish authorities but the Spanish court which is preventing him from leaving the country. We in this House should be very careful and should not interfere with judicial independence.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, let me remind you that the proposal prepared by you – following careful preparation by your officials – initially caused some confusion. The port authorities and shipping companies shot your proposal down in flames. In my view, we must also be grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Mr Grosch also worked very hard in the discussions with the industry, and as a result, we have largely assuaged the sector’s concerns. I think they were simply misunderstandings. I am very pleased that, especially with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur – which we on the Committee on Transport jointly support – we can establish and ensure here today that we are not proposing a European type of standardised container – I prefer not to use the term ‘supercontainers’ – which could obstruct our global transportation business. In the export and import industries, we are reliant on the effective, efficient and swift transportation of these loading units on ships without adaptation of currently existing cell guides etc. In my view, as stipulated in our amendments in committee, we must leave the task of working out the detail to the standardisation committees. As a lawyer, I would be reluctant to embark on the task of developing the fine detail in my role as a Member of this House. It is, however, my belief that the principles we have set out in the proposed amendments will ensure that the new European loading unit does not conflict with existing international norms. This new loading unit is important, for it enables us to align the industry’s interests in greater stowability of palettes with the interest of the shipping companies and port authorities not to have to change all the loading gear and the entire structure of the container ships. In this respect, I think we can be quite happy with what we have achieved. I hope that the industry will adopt what we are hoping for, namely more widespread use of intermodal units. We are reliant on the industry here. We simply make proposals and will have to wait and see whether the new standardised container is accepted by the industry. The industry’s task is to protect its own interests. Finally, I would like to point out that this proposal contains not only a definition of this new loading unit, but also a requirement for more stringent controls and inspections of all loading units, regardless of type. If loading units are not properly maintained and repaired, they can pose a danger in goods transportation, in port during trans-shipment etc. We must ensure that serious accidents do not occur, especially in ports and on ships. In this respect, the Commission is right to propose more frequent and thorough inspections of all loading units.

 Mr President, I too would like to join in the expressions of gratitude to you, Madam Vice-President, for the idea for the Single Sky was yours. You succeeded in getting it through the high-level group and in laying to rest many misgivings at national level, and, although Mr Schmitt is right to criticise what has emerged from the conciliation procedure, we do all agree that the system has undergone fundamental change. It formerly consisted of cooperation under Eurocontrol, but under Eurocontrol alone. The Member States were sovereign, there was no Community law, and each and every state could escape scrutiny by insisting on its own sovereignty. With this legislation, we now have a Community law that nobody can evade, one that can be adopted and amended by a majority, and the Commission’s role as guardian and administrator of Community law means that no Member State can admit that it is doing something not quite right in its own airspace control and safety measures, while asserting that it is no business whatever of the Commission’s. On the contrary, there is a manifest sharing of responsibility, and the Commission is at the heart of the implementation of the new law. I see this as a very great step forward, and one that is very much to be welcomed. As a result, I believe, we will be able to reduce waiting times in the air and at airports, and this will be to the benefit of passengers and airlines. We will be more successful on the environmental front, as every aircraft that spends too much time in parking orbit has a disastrous effect on our environment, and we will make progress in terms of safety, for fragmented technology and cooperation will be a thing of the past. Of course, I have to tell my socialist and post-communist friends that their belief that air navigation services must be provided by the public sector is one that I cannot go along with. If, though, we look back over recent years, let us ask ourselves where it was that service was always provided according to the book? Where was it that aircraft were left hanging in the air? The country that always occurs to my mind is one whose air navigation services are staffed by State officials, who do not necessarily make for better and more effective use of airspace. This, Commissioner, is something we need to discuss together as and when the opportunity arises. Following this legislative act, I believe, we will need – perhaps in two or three years’ time – a new initiative to introduce competition among air navigation services, where, as much as anywhere else, competition is required if performance is to be improved.

 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly rejects the latest attempts by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, to lift the arms embargo on the People’s Republic of China. (Applause)
 I am glad that the Council representative made it clear that the Council currently maintains the line that the arms embargo must be retained. You described the situation, Commissioner, but I urge you to be cautious. The 1989 European Council was right to impose the arms embargo after the peace demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were put down in such a bloody fashion. Commissioner, we too believe that there have been improvements in the human rights situation in China since then, but they have not been sufficient. Only recently, on 13 October, the Council reconsidered the situation in China and, just as Parliament had done in the same month, noted that the current human rights situation in China, as regards fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms did not meet even the international standards recognised by China. That being so, although we want progress in China, we should wait before it is achieved, and so it would send completely the wrong message if the embargo were to be lifted at the present time. On the contrary, we should be telling our Chinese friends that they need to make perceptible progress where human rights in China are concerned. There is a second reason why we should do this. You will be aware that presidential elections are to be held in Taiwan on 20 March next year, and the People’s Republic of China has, over recent weeks, been adopting a positively hostile stance towards Taiwan. As long ago as 23 October, this House stated its view that China should withdraw the rockets it had stationed in the coastal provinces opposite Taiwan and should commence peaceful dialogue across the Strait of Taiwan, which amounts to a flash point. That is the second reason why lifting the arms embargo makes no sense whatever. I therefore hope that we will not now send the wrong message, even if only by editing what we say, in the belief that we can lift the arms embargo because everything is laid down in the code of conduct. On the contrary, I believe that the tensions and the human rights situation, which is still unsatisfactory, mean that we have to maintain it. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would again like to straighten out something that has been said here. When I look at the Austrian Member who spoke of a basic right to health that we are all trampling under foot, yes, ladies and gentlemen, then I would like to call for an immediate stop to night journeys by freight trains, because people’s health is affected when railway trains travel through cities and villages at night making a tremendous amount of noise. Or I would call on the Austrians to close all their skiing areas, because I can assure you I can find enough experts to show you that what you are doing in tourism in skiing areas is bad for human health and the environment. You must be careful not to exaggerate with what you say. We are always looking at balanced legal situations where there is one legal asset and another legal asset and we have to find a balance between them. I believe that this compromise, which we have reached after long discussions, is a balanced solution. Because the compromise bans the transit of the dirtiest lorries; if the compromise is not adopted, then not only Greek lorries, which funnily enough you want to allow and which are the dirtiest on the road, but all dirty lorries will be able to drive through Austria. That is just an example to say, firstly, that your own position is not as glorious as it seems and, secondly, that this compromise does have advantages. My final comment is that one must always be careful what high horse one gets up on. Remember that in 1994 the Heads of State or Government called for the construction of the Brenner base tunnel as one of the 14 priority projects. Up until a year ago, your own Austrian planning envisaged that the Brenner base tunnel should be completed in 2021. And in response to pressure from this Parliament and others, Austria has now decided to bring forward the construction of the Brenner base tunnel to 2012. People who claim justice is on their side should be careful and consider whether they are really the saints they think they are. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, since rapporteur Lisi has already given us an excellent explanation of the compromise, I would simply like to deal in my address with a few rumours or arguments. Some Member States have recently been having doubts about the compromise, thinking it places too heavy a burden on the airlines. But that cannot be the case at all. The European Parliament has clearly reduced the rates of compensation in the airlines’ favour. The European Parliament has introduced clear rules for cases of force
 majeure
 so that airlines do not have to act if they are not responsible for the circumstances leading to a cancellation or overbooking. The Parliament has even put back the entry into force for 12 months because we take the airlines’ particular and difficult economic situation seriously. So these entire arrangements will not come into force until 2005. If the transport industry, be it the tourism sector or some other one, is now voicing doubts about this compromise, then I have to say that it is more than unfair and not at all acceptable. Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly hostile to the consumer if they take this line in the Council. European elections are looming, should the Council wish to take this subject up. May I make one further remark in conclusion? The budget airlines, who did not take any of this at all seriously at first, are now coming and saying that these levels of compensation are far too high. If a budget airline offers a flight for EUR 50, then it is still obliged to make the flight, despite the low price. Because the rights of the citizen who wants to go somewhere at a particular time, be it for business or tourism, have been violated and he must be compensated if he is left standing or can only fly a day later. Even budget airlines must compensate their passengers.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, although we are talking about the constitution as a means of making the European Union transparent, comprehensible and more democratic, I see a danger in that the same Council that is to make a decision on the constitution is, when it comes to a decision on the Trans-European Networks, breaking the law as it currently stands and trampling Parliament’s rights underfoot. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the present Treaties state that decisions on the Trans-European Networks, including the priority list – perhaps the President-in-Office of the Council would be so kind as to listen to me, and the honourable gentleman could perhaps move to one side – according to the present Treaties, the revision of the Trans-European Networks is subject to codecision by the Council and Parliament and is not within the decision-making competence of the European Council. The European Council exists to set down policy guidelines. If, though, the Brussels European Council, in the course of revising the Trans-European Networks were to make decisions on the list of actual priority transport projects that had the effect that practically all the funds for the next few years were spent, then that would be a flagrant violation of Parliament’s right to share equally with the Council in decisions concerning the Trans-European Networks and their revision. I therefore appeal to the representatives of the Council to take care that the European Summit does not trample upon those rights that the present Parliament already possesses. I also appeal to the President of the Commission: it would be devastating if you, Mr President of the Commission, having made such a clear statement on democratic and parliamentary rights, were, at the Council, to so tangibly to ally yourself with a Council which defines the priority projects in such a way that the European Parliament’s rights of codecision are practically nullified. Let us see to it that this European Council does not take back the rights of codecision on Trans-European Networks that Parliament already possesses. We want more rights; we want a democratic and more transparent Europe. I hope, Mr President-in-Office, that you can provide us with them.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats unreservedly endorses the very fine report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos. It is important that the rules drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation should actually be mandatory. We had lengthy discussions about whether this was even permissible, as shipping is a global business. No, though, we have to transpose the most important points into Community law, that being the only way in which we can really ensure that the IMO rules are promptly applied across the board in EU waters and in European ports, thus protecting the public from the potential dangers arising from terrorism, piracy or other illegal activities. We, too, of course, regret having to discuss these issues with relative speed. Along with the problem with financial sustainability, which Mr Folias has just addressed, people in the ports are constantly asking whether what we are prescribing is workable, and whether it can be implemented in practice. I hope that the Council will work very carefully through the results in practice when these regulations are transposed, but, as the IMO rules are to apply from 1 July next year, we believe it to be important that we should now create legal certainty, and so we endorse the rapporteur’s request that agreement be reached at first reading. We hope, however, that the rules devised jointly by the rapporteur and the Council will indeed result in workable and practical regulations in ports, as these are crucial nodal points which we want to make safer without hindering them from functioning. They must function, and I hope that we can achieve that.
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

rapporteur
. – (DE) 
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, in the course of difficult negotiations, Parliament’s delegation has been able to persuade the Council to accept a large number of rules in the interests not only of existing port systems and of the port workers, but also of fair competition conditions in and between ports. Even though there were some demands that we could not get the Council to accept, I therefore recommend that all Members of this House should accept the result of the conciliation procedure and express their satisfaction with what has been achieved. Considerations of legal certainty for ports, port operators, and port workers mean that the European Union needs its first basic directive on ports. Rejection of this compromise would leave unregulated for years matters of vital importance to European transport policy, such as market access within the ports and the conditions under which ports compete with each other, and would therefore open the door to distortions of competition among ports and uncontrollable duplications of their services. Let me issue a warning to those Members of this House who advocate rejection: if that were to happen, the Commission would be entitled to examine the situation in each individual port. We would do better to lay down basic rules, so that everyone knows from the outset by what rules they must abide. In particular, Parliament can count itself very fortunate that the Council has accepted its demand that the definition of self-handling should cover only the deployment of the shipping companies’ own seamen and not of its land-based staff as well. In that respect, Parliament has been able to give practical expression to the principal concerns of both the operators of ports and of the people who work in them. In order to achieve a compromise, on the other hand, Parliament’s delegation had to abandon its demand for a general requirement for prior authorisation for port services. The Council wants to follow the subsidiarity principle and leave this in the competence of the Member States. Our side was nonetheless able to gain acceptance for the idea that the Member States should be able to ensure that the competent authority can insist on prior authorisation for the provision of port services, so this is still left to the Member States’ discretion. Finally, the Council accepted Parliament’s amendments on periods and conditions for authorisations and transitional arrangements, in which Parliament has ensured that interests in ownership are put on an equivalent footing to leasing arrangements. Parliament’s delegation has also achieved acceptance for the requirement that authorisations be amended or abrogated where the criteria for authorisation or for the social security regulations to apply are not complied with in substance. It must therefore be noted that we have taken up an unambiguous position on the social conditions of port workers, and have done a splendid job of it. The Council also accepted that the Member States have to enact regulations whereby the newly-authorised service providers are obliged to make appropriate compensation payments to former service providers, but – and this is something with which we are not very satisfied – the Council wants this to be restricted to those instances in which the period of validity of their authorisations is reduced as a result of the new directive. One can see a certain logic in this. In all other cases, the legislation of the individual States is to be applicable. One aspect of the overall compromise that Parliament was obliged to accept with some regret was that pilotage services remain within the scope of the directive. This was, however, made acceptable by the Council and Parliament’s joint and particular emphasis on the importance of pilotage services in terms of safety and the protection of the environment, and the fact that the competent authorities can, on grounds of public safety, continue to restrict pilotage to one single service provider. Parliament eventually managed to delete the limited duration of authorisation for pilotage services, for which the Council had provided. I think Parliament broke new ground in managing to get the objectives of the directive extended by adding to them the creation of fair conditions of competition in and between ports. To this end, ports and the providers of port services are obliged to disclose to the Commission and to the Member States the financial relations between themselves and public undertakings. For its part, the Commission is required to draw the necessary conclusions from this with regard to removing distortions of competition, and it has already indicated its readiness to enact explicit directives concerning the degree to which public funding in ports is permissible. I would like to note, by way of summary, that this outcome from the conciliation procedure is a great success for all of us in view of the wholly negative stance initially adopted by the Council. I would like, in particular, to thank the Italian presidency of the Council and the Vice-President for enabling us to take this problematic dossier to what I regard as a good conclusion. Please permit me to make the following final observation. We are dealing here not only with single issues relating to ports. What is at stake here is ability of the EU’s ports to compete, being as they are crucially important as nodal points in the trans-European networks. We all share in the task of making these ports more efficient, and so I ask you to accept the outcome of the conciliation procedure and endorse it.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I would like to restrict my observations to our relations with China. My group endorses the view put forward by the Commission in its excellent policy paper on the new relationship between the EU and China; we are also very grateful to the Council for having made its position clear as long ago as 13 October. Whilst we believe that the People’s Republic of China is a significant strategic partner for the European Union and that both sides should be committed to building up relations between them, we share the Council’s concern that the current human rights situation in China, especially where fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms are concerned, still does not meet the international standards that China itself acknowledges. This is particularly the case as regards Tibet. Like the Council, then, we call for serious dialogue to be commenced between central China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. Whilst unequivocally endorsing the ‘one China’ policy, we join with the Council in calling for a constructive dialogue to be commenced between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China of Taiwan. The conflicts across the straits must be resolved by peaceful means, and so the rockets – which could be seen as a threat – must be withdrawn from China’s coastal provinces. Parliament’s great interest in having closer relations with Taiwan, including in a multilateral framework, is a matter of record. Commissioner, I hope that this Sixth EU-China Summit on 30 October in Peking will be successful in the sense to which the Commission and the Council have referred in their statements. Commissioner Patten, I wish you luck in what will be the first high-level meeting between representatives of the EU and China’s new leadership, in the hope that we will be able to make a new start on the basis that we have just discussed. All the best!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is early in the morning, and those of us who work in the domain of transport policy are delighted to have the opportunity to debate transport issues in the morning for once rather than at 9 or 10 p.m. (Applause)
 We hope that a few journalists are here too on this occasion, because the evenings are always so long, and so it is sometimes a little difficult to adhere to scheduled starting times. Anyway, without further ado, let us turn to the matter in hand. What we are discussing today are better conditions for railway operations in the European Union. By means of the three directives and one regulation, we seek to ensure that conditions are improved to such an extent that the railways in Europe will again be able to transport more goods and more passengers. As the rapporteur for the Directive on the development of the Community’s railways, allow me to begin by expressing my great satisfaction at the Council’s acceptance of our parliamentary position, which, contrary to the Commission’s proposal, advocates the preservation of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network that was established on 15 March 2003. Since that date, this first step towards the opening of the rail network in the fifteen EU Member States, which effectively covers 90% of the main rail corridors, has presented rail operators, irrespective of their national origins, with an equal opportunity to use the European rail network for international freight traffic in a way that best suits the needs of customers. Secondly, Parliament agrees with the Council regarding the opening of the remaining lines in the rail network to international freight traffic on 1 January 2006. That, however, is by no means a huge leap forward, since, as I just mentioned, practically 90% of total track mileage was opened to international freight traffic on 15 March of this year. Consequently, Parliament continues to call for the rail networks to be fully opened to national as well as international freight operators on 1 January 2006 so that the entire EU rail network will be open to all freight services, be they national or international, on that date. In this way we can truly achieve the aim set down in the Commission White Paper – and I am grateful, Commissioner, that we have always followed the same line here – to restore rail transport to its former market position by 2010 and to transfer as much freight as possible to the railways. The aim is more comprehensive than this, however. The White Paper is not just about freight; it is about striking a balance between the various modes of transport by the year 2010. For this reason, Parliament takes the view that passenger networks must be opened up too. If you consider the increase in the number of private cars on the motorways and the growth in the volume of air traffic, you will appreciate that our motorways and air corridors are coming close to saturation point. And this is why we in this House want the rail networks to be opened to operators of passenger trains on 1 January 2008. Unless we take that step, the shift from road to rail and air to rail that is envisaged for the year 2010 will leave passenger traffic untouched. It is quite worrying to see how low-cost air carriers are taking custom away from the European railways. I hope, Commissioner, that in the next few days you will have something to say about Charleroi airport in Belgium, because it is not acceptable that the railways should be making huge losses on their long-distance passenger services because the cheap airlines are luring their customers away and congesting our skies. In short, we want to ensure that the aim of rebalancing the transport market by 2010 applies to passenger transport too. Some people have repeatedly stressed that the Commission has announced the presentation of a third rail package by the end of the year, a package that will include passenger transport. That is all very honourable, Commissioner, but it does not help us in any way, because, as you know, if the Commission failed to present this package by December of this year, we could no longer adopt the package, or even give it a first reading, before the end of the current legislative term. Even if we did manage the first reading, the intervention of the European parliamentary elections, the appointment of a new Commission and the need to reactivate the legislative process would mean that it would effectively take one to two years to put through a bill on passenger transport, and so we could not adopt a third railway package before 2005. I believe, however, that the train operators need to know for certain now whether they will be able to benefit from a legal right of access to the entire network. We want them to have time to anticipate the needs of the travelling public so that we are actually able to effect the transfer of a substantial volume of long-distance traffic from road and air to the railways by 2010. Lastly, the committee proposed that the existing options allowing Member States to permit companies other than railway undertakings to apply for train paths should be scrapped in favour of a provision enabling consignors, forwarders and the like to apply for the use of train paths alongside railway undertakings in all Member States. We believe that every effort must be made to optimise the use of the rail infrastructure. We know that there is still spare capacity today, even on the Brenner line, and there is no point in our continued grumbling about HGVs when even this transalpine rail link still has spare capacity. In other words, we must enable more players in the market to apply for and use the available train paths if we want to maximise the volume of freight carried by rail. Allow me, as the spokesman for my group, to say a few words in anticipation of the other two reports, because it would make no sense for me to sit down and then stand straight back up again. I should like to begin these remarks on behalf of my group by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs from the other groups. We worked very well together, both at the time of the first reading and in preparation for the present second reading. Although Mrs Ainardi, Mr Sterckx, Mr Savary and I differed in our positions on specific points, we always regarded the railways package as an integral whole, hence our close cooperation as rapporteurs. I am highly gratified that we are all trying to follow the same line. You will be aware that the Council has already tried to find compromises that will enable us to conclude the legislative process quickly. The Council, along with the rapporteurs, has basically been trying to reduce the number of points at issue between the Council and Parliament, sometimes by accepting parliamentary positions and sometimes by proposing compromises, with the result that the conciliation procedure will focus on a core of considerably fewer than sixty or seventy points. I hope that we shall hear some judicious statements from the Council tomorrow regarding its intention of adhering to the line we began to discuss last week. We are interested in reducing the number of disputed points so that we can really focus our full attention on the major problems at the conciliation sessions. To this end, my group will carefully examine the latest batch of amendments to the railway directives and will vote accordingly on Thursday. Allow me to make two or three remarks on the Sterckx report. Mr Sterckx has tried very hard – for which I am grateful to him – to ensure that the European rail-safety standards guarantee a high level of safety and that there is no scope for the introduction by the back door of new national safety rules which would ultimately reinstate arbitrary restrictions on international traffic. I believe it is very important that we cooperate with the Commission in order to find a mechanism that prevents the introduction of allegedly essential safety provisions that are actually designed to discriminate against other rail operators. My group also attaches importance to the proper training of train crews and all other personnel on whom the safety of rail travel depends. We still have a problem here, Commissioner, that being that one directive devoted purely to the training of engine drivers might not suffice. We must train all other safety-related personnel to the appropriate standard of qualification. I support Mr Sterckx on the last point I wish to address from his report, a point on which I believe we all agree: staff training certificates must not lose their validity when personnel move from one railway undertaking to another. We need a single market for engine drivers too. We need competition throughout the domain of rail transport. Let me turn now to the Savary report. Mr Savary has very carefully incorporated the new budgetary rules, and I believe that the Council will endorse this so that all agencies have uniform budgetary rules and so that we avoid a situation in which each agency has its own rules, creating an incomprehensible tangle of budgetary provisions. The main point in the Savary report – and we are right behind the rapporteur on this – is the imbalance in the Council’s proposal for the composition of the Administrative Board. The amended proposal made by the Commission is for an Administrative Board comprising six representatives of the Council, four representatives of the Commission, and six non-voting representatives of the industry, in other words of the relevant railway undertakings, and rail users. The Council is now proposing that all Member States be represented on the Board. This would mean that six representatives of the interested parties, four Commission officials and, from May of next year, twenty-five Council representatives would sit on the Board. Only the Council could devise such a ludicrous scheme, and we therefore endorse the rapporteur’s view that we must use the conciliation procedure to put an end to it. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur’s amendments to the Commission proposal are excellent, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses them. Most of the amendments tabled by Mr Rack are intended on the one hand, to prescribe realistic safety standards for tunnels, and, on the other, to avoid the system for responsibility for implementation of common safety standards becoming too complicated and bureaucratic. I believe that he deserves particular credit for this. As the rules on the safety of tunnels tend very much to have been drafted with the tunnels in the Alps and similar areas in mind, but would make for major problems with traffic flow in those tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network that run through towns and cities, we endorse the rapporteur’s proposal that the administrative authorities be empowered to grant derogations from the general regulations for special tunnels in urban areas, as the minimum intervals – of 100 metres between HGVs, for example – would result in substantial tailbacks and hence in greater damage to the environment in tunnels in cities, the tunnel under the Elbe in Hamburg being one example. Similar considerations apply in the case of the obligatory examination of HGVs equipped with additional tanks before they enter a tunnel, which, thank God, is to be dropped as a result of the rapporteur’s vote. Let me conclude by saying that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the demand that building work to improve the safety of tunnels should receive general financial support from the TENs budget, as such measures could well overstretch the financial resources of individual Member States, and as improved safety in tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network is in the interest of all citizens of the EU. If I may put that in more specific terms, Commissioner, most tunnels are situated in that lovely country, Italy, and if Italy were to bear alone the cost of making transport safe, it would make for a problem for us all. That being so, I believe it to be important that the Community should – Mr Swoboda is catching my eye at this point – use TENs funds to cover a share of the work on improving tunnels in those countries that have long ones, as the reason why we want to improve the tunnels that these countries provide – whether we are talking here about Austria, Italy or even Switzerland and France – is the safety of those who travel through them, who are not only Italians and Austrians, but also many Danes, Germans and people from the Netherlands. This means that this aspect of finance is one that we should particularly take into account. Again, though, many thanks, Mr Rack, for your outstanding report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, my group obviously supports the rapporteur's approach of proceeding gradually, because it is right to do so. If I understood Mr Barnier correctly, he has also swung a little in the direction of the rapporteur, because originally it was still the case that the Commission wanted to say: the Member States will have to terminate all of their air service agreements and we will make new ones. If I understood Mr Barnier correctly, he is falling in with our line, because there are two things that we need to consider: we need to implement the ECJ ruling, and underlying that is also that we need to create fair conditions of competition for our European airlines in relation to third countries. That is an important task. But we also need to bear in mind that the airlines need legal certainty. They need legal certainty in their air service agreements with the countries of the world, and that is why we cannot terminate everything and say that we will stay in a state of flux. Instead we first need to restrict ourselves to those things for which the Commission has the manpower. That is why, Mr Barnier, it is right for you also to take the path that the rapporteur has proposed, and proceed on a step-by-step basis. The most important agreement is the agreement with the USA. We want a transatlantic market in air transport with reasonable access rules and reasonable competition rules, and I hope that the Commissioner for transport will brief us very soon in the committee on the extent to which preparations for the negotiations with the USA are already in hand and when negotiations will start. I think that from an economic point of view this is the most important agreement for all of our airlines, whether it be Air France, British Airways or Lufthansa, which is why we need to find a reasonable settlement, and it is also of great significance for competition between them. I therefore hope that we will make speedy progress here. Once we have produced such a model for an open, fair airspace with the USA, we will have to ensure, as the rapporteur said, that we apply it to those countries that either already have a similarly liberalised market or are striving to create one. Allow me to say in closing that, irrespective of this, we also urgently need to talk to Russia, because the Russian conditions for our airlines are fundamentally such that we cannot accept them. We should therefore proceed cautiously, start with the USA, but not lose sight of Russia.

Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes and approves the conclusion of the maritime transport agreement between the European Union and its Member States on the one hand and the People’s Republic of China on the other. This agreement is intended to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory treatment of European and Chinese shipping companies in each party’s respective ports and thus enable trade between the European Union and China to be carried on even more smoothly. This is all the more important in view of the fact that the People’s Republic of China is now already the European Union’s third largest trading partner. This agreement is important because it not only governs maritime cargo transport, including the intermodal transport associated with it, but also guarantees that wholly-owned subsidiaries can be founded in either State party to this agreement. Such subsidiaries shall be entitled, among other things, to employ key personnel irrespective of their nationality. I see this as amounting to a definite gain in terms of legal certainty for our European shipping companies. You are probably just as well aware as many others among us that we have many agreements and dialogues with China, but that it is the local authorities – and that is what the port authorities are – who sometimes have other ways of doing things. It is for that reason that it is of quite crucial significance that we should now be concluding an agreement intended to secure non-discriminatory treatment in all Chinese ports for our European shipping companies. It is, of course, for the Commission to ensure that this agreement is promptly and properly implemented throughout China, and you, Commissioner, and also Vice-President, de Palacio, can perhaps say something about why this is so. This is particularly the case as regards the non-discriminatory use of port infrastructures and maritime services by European shipping companies in Chinese ports, but it also applies to the case of European shipping companies, who have to pay duties and charges, doing so in the same way as others, without being put at a disadvantage or discriminated against, and as regards customs formalities, which must not handicap our trade and our shipping companies in Chinese ports. We also appeal to the European shipping companies to come to us and to the Commission if there are problems, so that we can follow them up. Let me now turn to the amendment to the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Watts, the latter of whom and I know each other so well. This amendment is quite simply superfluous. In the course of the proceedings in committee, there was some correspondence with the Commission, which said what you, Mr Watts, have yourself confirmed, namely that this is an agreement for Europe’s and China’s shipping companies. What flags their ships sail under is a matter for them. This is a matter of international custom, and so you cannot behave as if European shipping companies’ use of the flags of third countries were a crime or something highly dangerous. The Commission itself has given assurances that it will see to it that European seafarers are not put to any disadvantage by this agreement. We trust the Commission. The amendment is superfluous!

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is unfortunate that the Italian Presidency's programme of work in the field of transport, as it stands, contains two major omissions. The first is to expedite and complete the conciliation procedure on the second rail package, and the second is the conciliation procedure on the ports directive. As European Parliament rapporteur, I appeal to the Italian Presidency to give priority to these two legislative proposals, since promoting rail transport and ports could well be in Italy's national interest also. The Italian Government in particular could have a great interest in the further gradual opening up of rail networks, thus revitalising the rail sector and shifting more goods and passengers from road to rail. As Parliament’s rapporteur, I wish to offer the presidency an early conciliation procedure in the context of the second reading in Parliament, so that we can complete the second rail package by the end of the Italian Presidency. Increasing the efficiency of port services by means of increased competition and transparency could, however, also be in the interest of the Union as a whole, as well as of Italy with its long coastline and its pivotal role in the Mediterranean. That is why I hope that the Italian Presidency will take this conciliation procedure seriously and accept it as a priority. Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of calling on you, as a former member of our group and as a friend of our group, to help us in expediting these two important transport projects, that is opening up rail networks and opening up port services to increased competition and greater efficiency, by working quickly and effectively with us. Thank you very much! (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, if I disregard the opinions of certain individuals, such as certain French Members of this House, it appears to me that this House is of one mind where these two reports are concerned. Our standpoint is still that which we took at first reading, and I do not therefore want to respond to the small minority of radicals that has just spoken, but I would like to address the Commissioner in the words of a great German poet: more courage, Commissioner, more courage! I believe, Commissioner, we should remind ourselves of how, in the summer of 1999, when discussing your presentation of what you were going to do in office, we made the observation that the question of a unitary system of air traffic control was one example of an effective European policy that produced demonstrable added value. It is because that was the position you took in 1999, and because your proposals were in line with that, that we, like Mr Schmitt, are rather sad that your final comment on the Common Position was that, if that was everything that the Council was going to concede to us, then you were satisfied. So, more courage, Commissioner; we want the second reading to take us down the road your proposals indicated; we want functional airspace blocks! To Mr Miranda, who spoke just now, and to a number of others who have spoken before me, I have to say that the Member States, and Eurocontrol too, have had forty years in which to carve out the airspace blocks in ways that make sound business sense, and they have never done anything about it. It is for that reason that we – Parliament and the Commission together – must do it by means of well thought-out legislation. So, Commissioner, as we come to the reports’ second reading, let us, who are the majority in Parliament, and the Commission, be more courageous if we are to have a European added value in the skies above Europe!

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I do not believe that Mr Rack, or other Austrian Members can claim the moral high ground. That is simply false. If you argue along those lines, we will one day organise demonstrations to blockade Austria, preventing you from getting out and infringing our rights. The same laws must apply to all in the Community, and it is not acceptable that the Austrians should claim privileges. Let me give you a simple example. If you travel through Austria – to Hungary via Linz and Vienna – in terms of the topography involved, that is exactly the same as when Swedes and Danes travel to Rotterdam via Hamburg. Do those who live in the lower-lying parts of Austria have more of an entitlement to special rules than do those in other countries through which transit routes pass? Never could you justify such a thing! We are all in favour of vulnerable parts of the Alps being protected, but are you entitled to have the vulnerable parts of the Austrian Alps enjoy protection different to that enjoyed by those in France or Italy? If we are to introduce special rules for vulnerable areas, they must apply to all of them. There is, however, no privilege for Austria on the grounds of its citizens being of more value than the citizens of Italy or France. In moral terms, Austrians have no greater entitlement. Mr Swoboda was right to point out that we are trying to improve the environment for everyone. That is why, with reference to the changed charges for road use, Parliament has demanded that the burdens be more widely spread, dependent on the emission level. The Council has not gone along with our idea of this broader spread, so now we are going through the same rigmarole with them all over again. In December, it came up with this wretched compromise – which I will call a sham solution rather than a compromise – and, after ignoring our arguments at first reading stage, re-adopted the nonsense from December. So it is the Council that obstructs every sensible solution! I hope, Madam Vice-President, that you will shortly put before us a revised version of the rules on the charges for road use and that we will make distinctions along ecological lines as well. That, though, is how rules work; we have to set uniform standards for all parts of the European Union without laying down special rules for Austria. I therefore ask our Austrian fellow-Members to be a little more reflective. Austria cannot get on its moral high horse when no work has been done on building the Brenner tunnel since the 1996 decision on the trans-European networks was taken. It is just not on! The Dutch transport minister, Mrs Karla Peijs, has recently tried to achieve a consensus with the Council – and what have we heard? The Austrians reject anything of the sort. Whenever there have been discussions, the Austrian transport minister has waited two days before coming out with the same old nonsense. Along with most of the Members of this House, my plea is that we should seek the sensible compromise for which we are all ready.

 Mr President, Commissioner, what I am going to say is not directed at you personally, but, as you are representing the Commission, I trust that you will relay our discussions to your fellow Commissioner, Mr Liikanen. The fact is that I found your answer rather soothing. I believe that, as a result of the war in Iraq and of the outbreak of SARS in Asia, tourism in Europe and tourist travel to Europe have – as we say on the German coast – heavy weather to contend with, as does foreign tourism outside Europe. Air travel alone has seen passenger numbers decline, with a drop of 10% on flights to the Middle East and as much as 25% and more for flights to Asia. The airlines and tourism enterprises are doing their best to get the situation under control, but they need support from the Member States and from the EU. There are, alas, no indications so far as to how the European Union and the Member States propose to develop a joint strategy to alleviate this crisis and bring it to an end. So my first question to the Commissioner is to ask whether she is willing to appoint, on an ad hoc basis, a high-level working party, which would involve the tourist industry and whose purpose would be to develop a strategy to reduce the tourist industry’s costs and to stimulate international tourism? Secondly, Commissioner, and quite apart from the present crisis, the Commission must, I believe, examine the fundamental aspects underlying tourism and give primary and close attention to the competitive situation in the Member States. After all, it cannot be right, in a European single market, that the Member States should levy VAT at different rates on similar tourist activities. That distorts the competition among them. You will know – and have yourself emphasised the fact – that the tourist industry merits our particular attention precisely because it is in the hands of the same small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs and training opportunities over wide areas of the European Union. In conclusion, I want to repeat something that has been said by all the previous speakers, which is that support measures for tourism require legal certainty and legal clarity, and, for that reason, tourism must become a task in its own right in the constitution, with clear powers to act laid down for it. Commissioner, I admit that we too have problems with our representatives in the Convention, but the Commission, too, has two representatives there, and so I ask you whether the Commission’s two representatives have made an unambiguous request for tourism to be incorporated into the new constitution as a task involving powers to act.
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, once again I wish to contradict the previous speaker. He needs to get a sense of proportion. Germany's airlines and those of other countries are informing the public about the new situation, and telling them that if they wish to fly to the USA, they need to agree that this data should be passed on. Nothing is being hushed up here, the public is being told about this. Yes, it is evident that that is not enough, but you are acting as if the public were being deceived by the airlines, and that is simply not the case. I shall try to look at this whole issue from the standpoint of the airlines and their passengers for once. Because of the general recession, Europe's airlines were already in trouble before 11 September. The events of 11 September and the period that followed caused enormous problems not only for all European airlines but also for airlines in the US. As you will have read over the last few days, even American Airlines may have to file for Chapter 11 protection. So the airlines find themselves in an extremely difficult situation. This will also have an impact on airports and on employment. It therefore has to be said that there is no point in disrupting air traffic between the USA and Europe over the next few weeks because of arguments of principle. We need to ensure that we can find a constitutional and practical solution to this problem. Nor can I allow to go unchallenged the insinuation made by some Members that the US authorities will willingly misuse data on European and other citizens that comes into their possession. You need to bear in mind that before data protection was introduced in Europe, the Americans already had far more stringent data protection arrangements than we have, combined with strict rules about passing on data to third parties. So to that extent the allegation that the Americans would regularly misuse data passed to them is quite simply mistaken. What we do of course need, Mr Bolkestein, is clear answers from you. How do you intend to achieve legal certainty that the US authorities will only receive data needed to fight terrorism and no other data? How do you intend to ensure that the Americans – and this also applies to company data – are only given the data they need, as opposed to data they can use to outmanoeuvre our businesses, our airlines and so on? You need to guarantee that by means of unambiguous agreements with the Americans. That is the reason for my two other questions about the extent to which you are prepared to negotiate with the Americans. Which of the two possible legal solutions you have identified do you actually intend to pursue now, and how long will that take? I believe that in the present difficult situation faced by the airlines we cannot afford effectively to provoke an interruption of air traffic between the US and Europe.

 Mr President, I, too, think it would be right to vote on Amendment No 13 first, but I do believe that, in the event of Amendment No 13 being adopted – which I hope it will be – all the others will lapse. I do not see the need to vote on the others. As regards the question of language, we should not be having a great debate about it right now, but should proceed as follows. The committee wants – as, I assume does this House – to delete the words ‘regular land-based personnel’ from the Council's version. Whatever is in the other part – ‘seafaring 

personnel’ – we do not want to change it, and it should remain in the text the way it is in the Council version, so that questions of language do not bring us into conflict with the Council. So what we are aiming to do is to delete the words ‘regular land-based personnel’, and we should approximate the terminology used in English, French, and so on to the Council's Common Position, as we should not deviate from that. Thus far, I believe that Mr Piecyk and I are of one mind without having to engage in great linguistic discussions.

 Mr President, this amendment is redundant, as sentence 2 of Amendment No 24 makes provision for the eventuality of an appeal at law.

 Madam President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the stones that have been flung at this Parliament this afternoon, let us, dispassionately and calmly, debate an issue that we have had to deal with for months, indeed years – the issue of the European regulation of sea ports. The Council at last handed down its common position on 5 November, so that we are now through to the second round. There is one thing that I believe should be apparent even to those who were throwing stones this afternoon, and that is that seaports need to be regulated in the same way across the EU, as seaports, being nodes of intermodal transport, have a central part to play in European transport policy as a whole. There is a need for improvement in Europe's ports, and that needs to be accomplished, on the one hand, by clear rules on competition among ports and within each port, and, secondly, by means of transparent market access for harbour services. The Council has stated its position, and now, on the basis of the first position, we again have to give our opinion. There are four things I want to say about the 34 amendments that the committee has submitted. First, the committee takes the view that we need unambiguous provisions to establish fair conditions for competition between ports. Even though the Council and the Commission have made statements in the Council Minutes to the effect that they too can see the need for fair framework conditions for competition, such declarations of intent are not satisfactory, as, even if the Commission were to extend the transparency directive to ports, it would not achieve what we want, which is, firstly, that enterprises operating out of ports and the harbour companies should actually themselves provide the Member States and the Commission with details of the financial links that exist between them and the state, the region, and the cities; secondly, that the Commission should act on this information; thirdly, that it should then actually prohibit measures that distort competition; and finally, that it should put before us a transparency report that would enable us to see where we need to do more work. Madam President, the regulation on state aid that the Commission submitted at the last minute is not adequate, either. There has to be legal certainty for the ports and for the port companies. We have to know which financial arrangements regarding port infrastructure do not constitute subsidies and do not require modification, and which actually are subsidies and need to be approved. It follows that we need clear and binding guidelines. Secondly, we are agreed – in the committee at any rate – that pilot services are to be taken out of the scope of the directive. The Council's approach is to keep pilot services within the directive's scope, but then to state that all are free to do as they please. In contrast to that, we favour clear and open regulations. We want pilot services in the Member States to be regulated in the public interest and in accordance with the safety requirements in force in that Member State, whether these pilot services be private or provided by the state. That is something that the Member States should regulate for themselves. The demonstration, and a number of strikes in European ports, were about self-handling, and this is where I am, quite seriously, astonished. After all, we all spent last week in discussions with trade unionists. It was Parliament that, at first reading stage, restricted self-handling to a port's own staff and equipment. The committee's report introduces a further restriction – to a ship's own crew. The unions are striking, and I have no idea why. If they are generally opposed to European regulation of ports, then let them say so. They have not said that up to now. I take the view that there is fierce competition among ports, and that there must be openness and a fair balance between the interests of the shipping companies and the port companies. An individual port belongs neither to the people who work in it nor to some state-operated harbour monopoly, nor indeed to the shipping companies. A balance must be found between fair competition and entrepreneurial freedom, and so I can only say that our proposal on self-handling is the right one. Nor can I understand why some are now saying that we have to make all port services subject to a conditional agreement. The Commission has stated that the Member States can require that they be submitted for approval. At first reading stage, Parliament took exactly the same view, as did the Council in its Common Position. There is absolutely no reason – and, Madam President, I do not consider it permissible – to vote, tomorrow, on amendments imposing, in Article 6 (1), mandatory approval on all Member States at once. The Belgians can do things the way they want to, but it makes no sense to impose a course of action on the Finns, and so, tomorrow, we should have no misunderstandings in this House, and there should be no reference to election campaigns, wherever they are being fought. We of course want the compensatory payments to be arranged on a mandatory basis, with unambiguous criteria, and so we have no great problems in that regard. I know, Madam Vice-President, that we two have an excellent relationship, but on this point we are, unfortunately, at odds with each other, and I would again ask you to give the question further consideration. What this Parliament demands is a regulation that holds in a balance the interests of the shipping companies, of the port entrepreneurs, and of the workers both on the ships and on land. The proposal we are putting forward is an excellent one, one that all these parties should consider very carefully, and, in the conciliation procedure, they should also support the provisions on transparency. We both – as, I hope, does the Council – want seaports to be efficient and to perform well, and to be places where workers and entrepreneurs can coexist amicably.

 Mr President, I cannot understand my Austrian colleagues. After all, they should be satisfied with the way in which the Caveri report gives them another sensible transitional regulation. I want to remind you of one thing, something previously approved by the Council and endorsed by the Commission, and that is the fact that this special arrangement for Austria applies just as much to those parts of the country that are not in the Alps and from which, indeed, the Alps are not even visible, parts that are quite simply flat. I will remind the honourable gentleman and the honourable ladies that this is a special case, and a quite unjustified one at that. Do you imagine we do not get transit traffic in the north of Germany? Do you imagine that other parts of Germany, or of Belgium do not suffer from it? They are even worse off. What you are after is special treatment! In no way can you justify that! (Protest)
 Excuse me, my good sir, but why do not you behave like a parliamentarian for a change? We are not here to represent the interests of Austrian citizens, but the interests of the European Union's, all 370 million of whom also have a right to avail themselves of the free movement of services. This is not just about the Austrians' unilateral rights; the other 360 million citizens are also entitled to see Community law adhered to. The great thing about the Caveri report is that in it, we are proposing that there should again be a three-year transitional arrangement for the Alpine region. Just take a close look at that: in 2005, according to the Caveri report, even category 0 and 1 heavy goods vehicles are to be banned from passing through. That shows that we are meeting your people and their interests halfway! What you are doing here is constructing a fictitious bogeyman by claiming that the remainder of the EU is against you and the environment, which you alone allegedly care for. Ladies and gentlemen, that is intolerable. The Caveri report proposed a sound compromise between the interests of 360 million citizens of the EU and those of fewer than 10 million other EU citizens. That has to be weighed in the balance. I believe that the Caveri report ends up making you a good offer, in the form of a transitional arrangement. But it is not on for the Austrians to say that they want special rights, for, my good friend from the Austrian Socialist group, what has happened over recent years? You kept on wanting cross-subsidies. The European Court of Justice took note of the way you exacted exaggeratedly high tolls, and yet, with all the inflated resources you acquired, you did not manage to build the Brenner base tunnel. Those are the facts of the matter.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, firstly my sincere thanks go to the Vice-President for the White Paper that she has written with her colleagues. I believe that the approach to European transport policy that is advocated in the White Paper is a good one, namely of working on the supply side to restore the balance between the transport modes by 2010. Commissioner, I would ask you also to do all you can now to encourage the Greek Presidency to put the second railway package on the Council's agenda and to reach a common position, because railway policy is one of the core components of your White Paper and if we do not make progress here we can forget the whole idea, that you have stated in the paper, of getting more freight and passengers back onto rail. This is a genuine fear if the large States get together and simply say: we do not want to open up the markets; we do not want to modernise the railway structures. I hope that you will tell us how likely you think it is that we will still be able to conclude the second railway package in this legislative period. Because if we do not manage to do so in this parliament then the question is whether we will manage to do so in 2005, 2006 or 2007; if we do not then it will undermine the entire objective of your White Paper, namely to restore the balance between transport modes by 2010. I now turn to our excellent rapporteur to say that my friends and I will in any case have to reject two points, the first being paragraph 66 on setting up a road safety agency. Mr Izquierdo Collado, Commissioner de Palacio has rightly stated in her White Paper that we do not want to have any legislation on road safety in the next five years. We want to take best practice and see how we can reduce the number of deaths on the roads and achieve higher levels of road safety on this basis. If there is no European legislation, what do we need a new road safety agency for? I would suggest that we should ensure that the maritime agency, the air safety agency and the railway agency do their jobs properly. But let us not have yet another agency! I must say to the rapporteur that I cannot support paragraph 79, which advocates the setting up of another new transport fund, either. I say to previous speakers: it is your region and your Member State that will have to improve local public transport in your cities. We cannot spend European funds on tasks that are the responsibility of the Member States. We need the resources that we have for the trans-European networks. As it is we have too few resources here. If you take a look at what we have achieved with the Essen projects, which we agreed together in 1996, you will see that not even all 14 projects have been implemented, and we do not have enough money for them. We already have the Cohesion Fund, the regional fund and the ISPA fund. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not have yet another European transport fund! We need to support the trans-European networks and leave the rest to the Member States.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good day, even if there are not so many people listening at the moment – and I hope that the press will report on this important debate – because we are finally on the way towards also establishing an internal market in the rail sector. This is an absolutely crucial point, because this is the only internal market that is actually still lacking in the transport sector. That is why, Commissioner, our four reports express our full agreement, in principle, with the Commission's basic ideas. However, being a self-assured Parliament and co-legislator, we have also tabled some substantial amendments to the four Commission proposals. I hope that the Commissioner will support all of them. Why have we tabled amendments? By tabling these amendments we are seeking to hasten the revitalisation of the rail sector in the European Union. We must create the necessary framework conditions sooner, because if we do not manage to revitalise the railways, we will not meet our European transport policy objective – laid down in the White Paper – by 2010 either. By 2010 we want to bring the different modes of transport back into balance, which in practice means that we want to carry more freight by rail instead of by road and more passengers by rail instead of by air or road. To achieve this objective of putting a larger proportion of the overall volume of traffic back onto the railways, we need to create appropriate framework conditions. These must be such that the rail networks really are opened up throughout the Union to existing and new railway undertakings, that is that network access is liberalised. In addition, by adopting European standards we must also physically cross internal borders, meaning that trains must be able to cross borders without stopping or slowing down, so that we can also make the advantages offered by the internal market a reality from the technical point of view. And we need a high level of safety. Since in the future we will not only have the national railway companies in the Member States but also increasing numbers of private railway undertakings, operating across the Union, it is no longer sufficient for the national authorities to be responsible for safety standards. Instead we need common, high European standards of safety for the benefit of passengers and railway staff. Finally, we need a European railway agency to energetically push forward all of these measures and monitor them. We have made progress on interoperability, but too slowly. At a conference, technical experts informed us that it would take 30 years to achieve interoperability, that is for trains to be able to use different networks without stopping. Ladies and gentlemen, if we wait that long there will not be any railways left in Europe that are operated on a commercial basis. However, we want the railways, and so all of us here need to energetically drive these measures forward, and that is why we need a European railway agency. In an internal market for railways designed in this way, it will be crucial for modern, forward-looking railway undertakings to attract more freight and more passengers onto rail by providing services that customers want and that run on time. If we continue to have the kind of planning system that we have today, which means that a railway undertaking cannot guarantee when a train travelling from Germany to Italy is going to arrive – there are hour- and even day-long delays – then rail is not going to be able to compete with HGVs. But we want to create the framework conditions to ensure that trains can compete with HGVs. I should like to make four brief comments on my report. The first, Commissioner, is one on which I think we now agree. The Commission wanted to postpone the introduction of the special rail network for freight services in Europe, the so-called Trans-European Rail Freight Network, which the first railway package already states will come into being on 15 March 2003. We are against this and think that we need this special rail network on 15 March of this year so as to gain experience of cross-border freight transport. I hope that the Commission agrees. Secondly, we think that the aim set by the Commission of opening up the whole network to freight – both cross-border and national services – by 1 January 2006, as the Commissioner also indicated, should be clearly stated as from now, and not expressed as one-and-a-half years or two years after entry into force. We want everyone to know that on 1 January 2006 they can be prepared for the networks actually to be opened up to freight services. Thirdly, it is our view, Commissioner, that we also need to extend these rights to use rail for freight transport to other transport operators, not only the traditional railway undertakings or the new railway undertakings, but also the shippers and carriers. Because only if all the players in the sector are on board – and that includes the shippers and carriers – will we be able to transfer freight from road to rail. I therefore hope that you will also agree to the independent rights that we want to grant them. My final point, Commissioner, relates to something that you did not address just now, but I should in any case like to make this request. You said that the Commission did not want to table proposals to open up the networks to passenger services as well until 2003. We in Parliament are one step ahead of you and have said: no, we do not want there to be so much domestic air traffic in Europe and would prefer passengers to take cross-border passenger train services. We therefore also want the rail market in passenger services to be opened up. We are proposing making it possible for cross-border passenger services to operate from 1 January 2006, like freight services, and national passenger services at a later date, from 1 January 2008. Commissioner, it is precisely if we want to ensure that airspace is used sensibly that we need to attract more passengers onto the railways. I hope that you will support us in this. Two final comments on the Sterckx report: I think that this report on safety standards is so magnificent that all I can say is that its main points go to the heart of the matter, in that it makes the provisions more precise and advocates a high level of safety in the interests of passengers and staff. That is why we will be fully supporting this report. Finally, Commissioner, I hope that you agree with us that we should encourage the Greek Presidency actually to adopt the common positions in March so that we can move the procedure forward and perhaps conclude this chapter, on opening up the railways in the European Community, by the end of the year. Even if one or two Member States should have problems, the Community Treaty allows a decision to be taken by a majority in the Council of Ministers, and we should encourage the Greeks to take advantage of this possibility.

 Mr President, I think we can make things easier for ourselves. My group opposes the oral amendments. I am sorry, but having discussed these reports in detail in the committee and voted on them as a package, it is simply out of the question to untie that package by making changes at this stage. That is why my group opposes all oral amendments to the Ainardi report.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and our erstwhile lady colleague, I believe that any framework directive or Green Paper should take into account our previous experience with services of general interest. That being so, I want to give an example of how we in this House can bring some influence to bear. If we were actually to manage to at last make some progress with the legislation on local public transport, we would have done a substantial chunk of Parliament's and the Council's work. Here, for once, I would like to give the Commission credit for submitting a very specific proposal for a regulation on local public transport as long ago as 2000. We in this House delivered an unambiguous opinion on it in 2001. And what is the Council doing? It has shoved the draft in a drawer, done nothing with it, and still does not want to do anything with it. I believe that we have to make it clear to the Council that we will not put up with further delays on matters as fundamental as the right range of services provided to people in towns and in the regions, but may well have to consider bringing proceedings against the Council in respect of its failure to act. Why, ladies and gentlemen, is this issue of legislation on local public transport so important? The law on the situation we are in is unclear. We have the option of awaiting rulings from the ECJ, but we want the decisions on what public transport systems should be like to be taken politically, and so we, the towns, the communities and private enterprise, need legal certainty as to how local public transport is to be organised. The second point I want to address is as follows. I believe that a slip of the tongue has crept in here. Services of general interest and competition are not mutually exclusive, but are, in my view, mutually complementary, something that we see particularly clearly in local public transport. If, in the exercise of its responsibilities for public services, the city or the region makes the right decision and defines what is required of local public transport – its accessibility to disabled people, the timetables, the intervals between services and the fares; you can add all the social factors you want – then, Mr President, it must be put out to tender, and then the best offer must be accepted, whether it be from the public or private sector. It is competition that decides, and the public that benefits.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, I am glad that you are here and that we are engaged in discussion, but I must go straight to the heart of all these debates. I was delighted to read the resolutions from the Transport Ministers' Council of 5 and 6 December on increased safety at sea, but – alas – I have no faith in them. Let me give you two examples. Up until now, the Council has always done its utmost to defend the use of single-hulled tankers up to 2015, and suddenly the Transport Ministers in Council announce an immediate end to the use of single-hulled tankers for the transport of heavy oil. In addition, there is this wonderful question, Mr President-in-Office: by virtue of which law is this to come about? We cannot make it Community law within the next couple of weeks. Can you quote me any national regulations that will put the Member States in any sort of position to implement the ban on single-hulled tankers? My second point, Mr President-in-Office, is that Mr Piecyk and others have already referred to the fact that a number of Member States are failing to meet the obligation imposed on them by the port state directive of controlling 25% of the vessels calling at EU ports. Now, acting through the Council of Transport Ministers, the Council has decided to increase its efforts to step up monitoring of controls, if at all possible by 1 January. Can you, in your capacity as President-in-Office, confirm how many posts have been newly created for inspectors, and in which countries, in the course of the last week or the last ten days, and how many qualified applicants there are for these positions as inspectors? You see, Mr President-in-Office, passing fine resolutions is no use at all. What we want you to tell us is how they are to be implemented. I would like to refer back to Mr Sterckx, who wrote the report on ports of refuge. He is perfectly right, and here too, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same questions arise. You have now said that the Member States should set up ports of refuge and register them more quickly, but I would like you to tell us how you propose to ensure that, once the individual states have designated the ports of refuge, they are actually set up. Let us remember that the Erika
 wanted to call at a port and was not allowed to, and the question is similar when it comes to the Prestige
: if she had called at a port, might she not have avoided breaking up, might it not have been possible to pump out the crude oil more easily and to avoid a disaster of such a magnitude? Mr President-in-Office, how do you intend to make sure that the Member States do actually set up these ports of refuge so as to avoid greater calamities? (Applause)
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to confirm first of all that the majority of the PPE-DE group of course supports the Commission proposal, along with the essential proposals to improve it that have been made by Mr Lisi. The proposal has a clear two-pronged approach. It firstly calls on the airlines to use the volunteering principle, whereby the airline makes offers to individuals to identify those who do not urgently have to take the next flight, but could also take the one after that. It is true that experience in America with the volunteering system has been positive. If there are not enough volunteers, however, and everyone wants to go home or to their business appointment and passengers are denied boarding, then they must have some legal redress. They have booked a flight, they have an OK on their ticket and they therefore have a right to board. If the airline overbooks in its own economic interests, because it knows that there are a lot of no-shows, then it must pay if it cannot uphold the booking. It is as simple as that. Because if passengers have an OK on their ticket they have the certainty that they can travel, and if they cannot then the carrier has to pay. Commissioner, you were, of course, a little harsh about the level of the payments. My colleague, Mrs Foster, with whom I do not always agree, said something that is very true. Air prices have fallen in recent years and that is why the argument that we should set compensation very high, so as to take account of recent cost increases, is clearly flawed, because air prices have fallen. Most of us in any case are familiar with the ingenious system of special tariffs, which mean that you can easily fly at more reasonable prices than those prescribed. With this in mind, please understand that we have reduced the compensation to a level that we deem to be economically fair. Our view is that if excessive compensation is paid to passengers who are not taken on board, the carriers will pass on these costs to all passengers, and then general price levels will rise, which will affect more people than those denied boarding. I say to Members of the Liberal Group – we usually see eye to eye, but today, exceptionally, we do not – that we have to set a flat rate of compensation for two reasons: firstly, the prejudice suffered by anyone who is denied boarding is always the same, whether they have paid EUR 150, EUR 500 or more for their ticket. They have been given a guarantee that they will fly and they are left behind. It is completely irrelevant how much the ticket cost. Their confidence has been damaged, and more besides. That is why I believe that the low-cost carriers, which actually do not have any problems with overbooking because they do not accept more passengers than have booked, should also compensate passengers for any injury caused if they cancel a flight for economic reasons, and they obviously do this from time to time. We need uniform tariffs so as to make the job of the poor airport staff easier. You see, if a passenger is denied boarding or a flight is cancelled, we want the compensation to be paid at the gate. You really cannot expect the poor flight attendant to calculate thousands of prices and people to wait until she has calculated the individual compensation entitlements. I therefore believe that our proposal is quite sensible. With your permission, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who is unfortunately unable to speak this evening and who has asked me to make some points for her, I should like to refer once again to the split vote that we are proposing on Article 3(2). This states that the regulation does not apply to passengers travelling at a reduced fare which is not available directly or indirectly to the public. We fear that this wording is very vague. We should state quite clearly that a passenger travelling at a reduced fare also has a right to full compensation. I believe that it is very important that the provision is interpreted in this way. Commissioner, I should like to ask you one more question. As you know, Mr Lisi has made a very good proposal on Article 13, namely that the Member States have to ensure that if a carrier pays compensation and is not in actual fact responsible for the delay or cancellation it may have recourse to those responsible, whether it be air traffic control or other bodies, including state-owned systems. With a view to ensuring fair burden-sharing, can you assure us that, if we make the airlines responsible for paying compensation in the first place, they will also be able to have recourse to any state-owned organisations that have caused the delay or cancellation? You would assist us greatly if you were to support this portion of our amendments.

Mr President, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my dear Bertel, Commissioner, I will start by saying how glad I am that, as well as people watching the debate, there are in the galleries diplomats from the People's Republic of China and also representatives of the freely-elected parliament of Taiwan. I think it is a great thing that both sides of the straits are following our debate today. Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I speak on behalf of the PPE Group when I make the observation that we very much welcome your statements on the preparations for the fourth ASEM process. I believe that your statements constitute impressive evidence of the careful and committed way in which both the Council and the Commission have prepared for the ASEM IV meeting. My group, however, calls for something about which I would ask you to say something in greater detail, namely, in view of the plethora of issues to be discussed, which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned, for there to be definite action by the Heads of State and of Government, with firm timetables and defined objectives. It is not enough to do as we did at ASEM III and discuss all the problems we have in the world, taking in the economy, culture, politics and education, leaving the public to wonder after the event what actually came out of it all. Hence our preference, and our demand, for fewer but definite plans for closer cooperation between Asia and Europe. Please allow me to pick out from the abundance of issues that have been mentioned, just three on which I believe it important to us in Parliament that the Heads of State and of Government in Europe and Asia should bring forth definite results. The first is that a start be made on a special process of bringing the two cultural horizons together. It is precisely in view of the anniversary of the terrible events of 11 September that Europe and Asia, whatever their many historic, cultural and religious differences, must define, for the sake of our co-existence and peace in the world, what they have in common, what binds them together and draw conclusions from this. We expect this political and cultural dialogue to have a definite starting point. The second issue is one that Bertel Haarder, being a Dane, will well understand. As regards terrorism, there is one point on which we want something definite, namely the combating of terrorism at sea. Over and over again, our ships, when sailing between Asia und Europe, fall prey to pirates in certain narrow stretches of sea. We cannot explain to the public how it is that we are in a position to combat terrorism throughout the world, but apparently incapable of facing up to terrorists in narrow stretches of sea, terrorists who endanger our ships' crews and kill them! The third is the problem of migration. In the President-in-Office of the Council, whose remit not only includes European policy but also immigration, we have a good partner, one who will see to it that definite decisions will actually be taken in the course of ASEM IV on how we can cooperate better in combating the illegal movement of people between Asia and Europe. I will now turn briefly to Mr Maaten's report, which is of course an excellent one. Time compels me to highlight only five aspects of it, so please forgive me for that. Commissioner Patten, you pointed out that the issue of enlarging ASEM's membership calls for a consensual approach, but you quite rightly understood that we in Parliament want to encourage you to talk with our Asian partners in ASEM IV in preparation for the Hanoi conference. What is at issue is the assertion that 'we will enlarge from 15 states to 20'. As Europeans, we consider it important that Asia should concentrate particularly on including such countries as India and Taiwan in the Asia process. You yourself pointed out the special role that India and Taiwan play. I believe that we should, so to speak, ‘push’ these countries in order to get them accepted. You have already demonstrated political commitment to a dialogue on human rights, and on that you have our full support. I believe that the human rights dialogue with the People's Republic of China, which has just begun, has demonstrated that both sides will from now on be working on the basis of human rights being universal in character. Let there be an end to the appalling argument about whether there are Asian or European human rights – on the contrary, human rights are universal, and it is on that basis that the dialogue should be proceeded with. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe should also perhaps play more of a part in the prevention and resolution of conflict in Asia. The security of the region is of crucial importance for the world as a whole. That is why we should also give constructive support to the political dialogue between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on the basis of democracy, peoples’ right to self-determination, respect for human rights and for the rule of law. We should also be endeavouring to play some sort of role in reducing the tensions between India and Pakistan. This has to do not only with the protection of cultural minorities, but also with the protection of Christian minorities in the region. We are very grateful to you, Commissioner Patten, for referring, in your capacity as the Commission's spokesman, to the prompt inauguration of the delegation to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal. That is something that Parliament has long desired. We need to have higher-profile representation in a continent comprising half of the world's population. On that you have our support. Please permit me to conclude on a note of mild criticism. Today finds us discussing the great importance of Asia and Europe, and the two continents' relationship with one another. I hope I am not off beam in saying that there will soon be, and also in September, a meeting, a summit between the European Union and China, which is scheduled to take one day. I wonder whether the Heads of State and of Government should not perhaps take longer than just one day to embark on a truly in-depth dialogue with the People's Republic of China. I think that would be appropriate in view of that country's significance and that of the continent. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to start by apologising for my absence from the beginning of the debate, having arrived in Strasbourg only this morning. All the things that have been gone through in detail should actually, I think, give us cause for rejoicing this morning, for we have come a long way, even if it took us three years to do it. The Commission said in its first speech – which was in the summer of 1999 – that a single system of air traffic control is a typically European problem, and one that we must deal with in a European way. The Vice-President then set up the high-level working party. We MEPs were not entirely happy with that, but it was the right thing to do in that she was trying to take on board the concerns of the Member States, which feared ill-founded centralisation. It was therefore right to set up the high-level working party, which submitted its report in 2000. Then, in 2001, the Commissioner set out the proposals for directives. Today, having had good debates in Committee, Parliament is to complete the First Reading stage, which means that we have come a very long way in three years and we should just rejoice in that. Secondly, some philosophical differences remain, and that is only natural, but let us just give them some thought. I believe that there are sufficient examples to demonstrate that military and civil air traffic control can be integrated and linked up, thus becoming more effective, including in the interests of military security. This antithesis 
between military air traffic control and its civil counterpart is something we should overcome. For another thing, we should emphatically reiterate that we are democrats and that democracy means that it is the government, monitored by Parliament, that has to come to a decision. That is why Eurocontrol is, at the end of the day, something which we cannot get into bed with. Eurocontrol is a board of civil servants whose technical expertise and function of providing services in specific sectors we acknowledge, but it is the European Union, the Commission, that must exercise a regulatory function, and be monitored in doing so by us, as it is we who are responsible for regulations enacted by the State. Madam Vice-President, perhaps you could tell us in your response with what success the Council has met. With the high-level working party you gave the Council every opportunity, and yet it was able to conduct negotiations in parallel. Can we be certain that the Council will finalise the dossier with a Common Position by Christmas? Only if it does will we be able to achieve the objective by 2004.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, in principle, we transport experts among the Christian Democrats also support the Commission proposal on noise charges, as we have to use higher charges for noisy aircraft to give the airlines a practical stimulus to use quieter aircraft, and thereby protect the public from a needlessly high level of perceived noise. Those of us who sit on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are not very happy with the Committee on the Environment, Health and Consumer Policy, as the Environment Committee has simply rejected the proposals that the Transport Committee had adopted by a large majority. The Commission should reconsider how it might reintroduce our proposals, as the Transport Committee's proposals were aimed at giving airports a far more sophisticated framework within which to calculate noise charges. We want to make it clear in law that it is possible to spread the burden more widely and that aircraft are, as an alternative, to be liable to charges either according to certification or in accordance with the noise levels as actually measured. We take the view that what we proposed in the Transport Committee is more environmentally effective, and that it maintains a higher standard. In the EU, we have in fact always acted according to the principle that, where extensive and effective environmental protection systems are already in place and we lay down a minimum standard at European level, the countries and groups with more highly-developed systems do not have to reduce their standards. You, Commissioner, are in a position to set at nought my concern that we might be using European law to lower existing noise standards, and you can do it right now. A broad majority of us in this House has agreed on Amendment No 11, which is to be added to the Blokland Report, by which we seek to make it clear that existing, more effective, noise charge systems may be retained, and thus that European law does not mean a step backwards for the protection of the environment. To that extent, Commissioner, I look forward to your comments on Amendment No 11 with great expectation.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I wanted to reply to my Bavarian colleague, but he has left the chamber. So I shall say it for the record. It is ludicrous that somebody always cries out to the Commission for help when the Austrians close the Alps. Yet when we do something really sensible, like imposing standard rules for traffic restrictions, he questions whether the Community is competent to do so. I would take this opportunity to remind him that you cannot take a stand on more than one platform at once. The whole thing is quite logical. We are discussing traffic across borders, the trans-European networks, and our desire, expressed in the White Paper, for an efficient system for utilising them, and along comes an MEP and says that Europe has no competence in this area. I can only say that such a thing is laughable, absolutely laughable. Even though I am from Germany, a country battered by transit traffic, with lorries crossing it from north to south and west to east, I nonetheless take the view that we need European regulation. We must have rules to sort out the conflict of objectives between the interests of the local citizens – who are opposed to noise and to clogged roads – and the interest of the economy in getting traffic through. We complain about high unemployment, but if we want to deal with unemployment, we need economic growth. You cannot get economic growth off the Internet. You can order goods that way, but, as you have to have them delivered, jobs in industry depend on the efficient utilisation of the trans-European network. The assertion that this has nothing to do with Europe, and that every country can do as it likes, is positively absurd, and our being on the threshold of EU enlargement makes it all the more so. We should be giving the countries that are about to join us a sheaf of unambiguous and harmonised regulations that they know they can stick to and be guided by. There is a general need for European regulation. We simply have to declare that nobody, not even the Commission, wants to use the system of efficient reporting and monitoring of supplementary restrictions to change the Member States' public holidays. That is just nonsense. This is primarily about weekend journeys. That is the issue. Any haulier or employer has to know when and where they can pass through and when and where they have to stop. Then, of course, there have to be proper parking places with sanitary facilities. So, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, there is just one question to which I would like you to give me an answer. Mr Savary, who was a very good rapporteur, has proposed this European apparatus for road traffic information. Are you prepared to support it? If you are, then I would tell Mr Ferber that, if we want an efficient information system, we have to lay it down in a directive, in order to require the Member States to play their part. We know that Member States do not supply up-to-date data if systems are voluntary. So that is what we need. Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, are you ready to support Mr Savary's great idea for such a mechanism? (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are trying by means of this instrument – which we must recognise deals with a technical field which we have to acknowledge overstretches our capacities as MEPs – to apply the law to technical matters. Commissioner, this new instrument presumes twofold legitimate expectations. For a start, we are trusting the Commission, as, before the directive reaches us and is adopted by us, we have to expect that you will check to see that the Commission really will fulfil its obligation for the next two or three years from the word go, as it were. It is, secondly, presupposed that you must, in theory at least, join us in trusting the industry to actually do what it has declared itself willing to do. In so far, I call on the industry and the Commission to prove to us and to the citizens whom we represent, that legal undertakings are a good way of achieving rapid improvements, particularly in technical fields. As has been said, though, we Members of this House are, as I see it, obliged to check up on the Commission and on the industry to see whether they actually merit our trust and whether they really are promptly and effectively putting their promises into practice. I would like, Commissioner, to make another point. I take the view that, should this directive and this system come to pass, we in this House must also be free not to insist on all the old technical standards. That, Mr Bouwman, is why I cannot vote for your Amendment No 9, as item 14 of our motion for a resolution states that we expect the directive to take as standards either the four EEVC tests or other methods offering at least equal or possibly better safeguards. This Parliament should not behave in 2002 as if it already knew what testing methods will be right in 2005 and 2010. So, Mr President, as regards the question of which are the right tests for the framework directive, I ask the Commissioner to submit proposals founded on objective criteria and modern knowledge.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, on behalf of my group, would like to warmly welcome Mr Stockmann's report, as it is an excellent one, and one which deals with its subject very much in depth. I speak for the majority of my group when I say that my colleague Mrs Foster, for whom I have very high regard, has this evening put forward an opinion held by a minority in our group. The majority in my group, just as in the committee, supports the Commission proposal to unambiguously clarify the legal nature of slots and to finally make clear that trading in slots between one airline and another is illegal and will remain so. As rights of usage, the slots belong neither to the air carriers nor to the airports, and have only an ancillary role. They enable air space to be used efficiently, economically, and in a way that treats the environment with respect, and so my group will be voting against Mrs Foster's three amendments tomorrow, believing as we do that the Commission is very much in the right. Secondly, I believe that the new version of the slot regulation aims at formulating the rules for the allocation of slots in a way that is more transparent and more favourable to competition. Of course, the ‘grandfather rights’ of the existing airlines are to be safeguarded, but only to some extent. We need competition, and I hope that my British colleagues will agree with me on that. We need competition, and so we also need new slots for new air carriers, in order to better organise competition in air travel and for the passengers' benefit. The end result is that the coordinators' roles and independence are strengthened. This is to enhance the possibility of taking unused times from the existing airlines and allocating them to others, thus improving the efficiency with which airspace is used in an economical and environmentally friendly way. That is the objective. Mr President, Madam Vice-President, please let us conclude by pointing out that I hope that the Council will, under Spanish Presidency, take a significant step in June. We have done our homework. We have, admittedly, produced 52 amendments in committee, but they are in the interests of greater precision. I hope that the Commission will work a miraculous transformation and support most of them. In any case, it strikes me as important that the Council should reach a decision quickly, as we want the revised slots regulation to benefit air carriers, and we want it without delay. Airlines have found themselves in difficulties as a result of the general economic recession and of the events of 11 September. We believe that a revised slots regulation will help airlines, airports and passengers, and so we ask you to support the Stockmann report.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of my group, to express my most sincere thanks to the rapporteur who has not only done a vast amount to familiarise herself with this complicated material – indeed, she is a veritable expert on it now – but has also tried as far as possible to make some excellent proposals. We are very disappointed with the Council, though. When, in December, we tried to find a common approach at first reading, it proved incapable of talking with us at all. In the last two weeks as well, when, following the committee discussions, the rapporteur again tried to reach agreement with the Council, the latter was again unable to oblige. I have to say that it is shocking that, in a situation following 11 September when passengers are in danger, the Council is unable to quickly reach an agreement with us. We have a counter-example. Just a few weeks ago, the Council and Parliament together took no more than three months to find a practical solution to the issue of restrictions on airport operations due to noise. The fact, however, that, on as important a matter as that of passenger safety, the Council is unable to reach an agreement with us is disgraceful, and we need to say so in no uncertain terms. I also hope that, if we vote as one tomorrow, the Council will have second thoughts and will want to join with us in finding a solution through the conciliation procedure. I would also appeal to the Commission too to tell the Council that we have done everything to reach an agreement with it. The Council was unable to oblige, and I now expect the Commission to support the vast majority of our amendments at least. The Council must see Parliament and the Commission acting together. Allow me to make two observations. Firstly, it is very important that the Member States acknowledge that they have to bear some of the costs of the increased security measures. It is simply not acceptable that, at public expense, the police in my country patrol and oversee every football match, from which the professional clubs do not earn such a bad living, while the Member States do not wish to make their contribution to the cost of increased security measures at airports, which are in the interests of everyone and not only of the airports. That is simply not on. We expect the Council to accommodate us on this crucial point. The second, somewhat critical question – and one addressed by Mrs Foster – is that of whether employees really need to be vetted 100%. My group shares the rapporteur’s opinion, but I for my part take a different view of this issue. Allow me again to point out that, unlike passengers, employees are in principle vetted before they are taken on. If they were then to be checked up on five or six times a day, then that would be a bit too much of a good thing. We have to realise that, important as security is, there must also be practical arrangements at airports and for the passengers and airlines that use them. I therefore hope that we take a different decision tomorrow. Those who committed these criminal acts on 11 September were not airport or airline employees.

 Mr President, Commissioner, unlike the lady who spoke before me, I am not sure whether membership of the WTO will automatically lead to political change in China, but that is something I shall return to shortly. I think it was a good thing that the People's Republic of China joined the WTO. It was not a straightforward thing for the Chinese to do, as it will mean major processes of internal restructuring for them, but I consider it urgently necessary from the point of view of China's interests that these processes of restructuring should start now. I also believe that it represents a good starting point for an improvement in trading relationships. I wish, though, to appeal to the Commission to keep a careful eye on how China meets the obligations it has entered into by joining the WTO. The behaviour of China, which had made promises, for example to open up the insurance market, has not been very encouraging in recent years. Promises were made, but attempts were made to evade them. In this respect, I hope that China will give real and positive acknowledgement of what the consequences must be – and it would be interesting if the Commissioner were to make a statement on the line the Commission will take on this. As regards political dialogue, my fellow Members have all made reference to the human rights issue. These human rights apply universally; they are not European human rights that we want to enforce on China, but universally recognised human rights that we demand, and they include the rights of minorities, be they religious or cultural. My fellow Members have already had something to say about Tibet. I would like to take up another example, the persecution of the unofficial Catholic Church in China, which has to exist underground because the government does not recognise the Catholic Church which sees itself as linked to the Vatican. That is not acceptable. Turning to Taiwan, I hope that the People's Republic of China will open political dialogue without setting prior conditions. It is only political dialogue of this kind that can lead to reunification, and then only if this is on the basis of human rights and of democracy in a constitutional state. We in Parliament should play our part in promoting 
contact between the two states. We should likewise maintain contacts with members of the parliaments in the People's Republic of China and in Taiwan. Commissioner, I hope that the Commission will soon set up its office in Taipei, so that the Commission, too, may support dialogue between the two states by means of its missions in Beijing and in Taipei.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I believe that it is vital for the Council to take a rapid decision on what we will be approving at second reading tomorrow. The rapporteur has been very cautious. He has not gone too far at second reading, because we want rapid results, as, let us be honest, it is a long time since the Erika II
 sank. So we need to take measures without delay and I would like to point out that transponders are not only suitable for monitoring but first and foremost also for rescue purposes. So if a vessel really gets into trouble at sea and can no longer set off an adequate distress signal, it can be reached and rescued more quickly by using transponders. Our requests to the Council with regard to equipping vessels with transponders and voyage data recorders are really very modest. We can only hope that the IMO will agree an accelerated timetable in the autumn, one that we can implement without delay. Commissioner, the vital thing here is for us to react more quickly, and Mr Sterckx has been kind enough to give you three years to sort out compensation for ports that accommodate ships in distress. The Erika
 need not have sunk if it could have entered the port, and it is therefore a reflection of the situation here. We need ports that can accommodate ships in distress, but if those ports are to allow ships to enter, we need compensation arrangements. Commissioner, I urge you to sort out those arrangements more quickly, because ports will then be far more willing to accommodate ships in distress and a case like that of the Erika II
 can be avoided. (Applause)

 Mr President, two minor drafting errors have crept in here. The first error is in Amendment No 48. It should say "the competent authorities", in the plural; there was not any disagreement between the Council and Parliament about this, it was just an error in the wording of the amendment. Similarly, we made a small error in Amendment No 52, in which two words have been omitted from the written version. However, in the case of Amendment No 52 in particular, this goes a long way towards meeting the wishes of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I would therefore ask you to approve the two oral amendments and to vote accordingly. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors in the gallery, we now turn to a Commission proposal to further reduce noise in and around airports. This proposal implements an agreement which was adopted at the ICAO Assembly in the autumn of last year and which applies throughout the world. Personally, of course, I have certain reservations about it because at the ICAO Assembly the entire system was changed. They abandoned the system of taking certain types of aircraft out of use altogether or suspending their use and moved over to a so-called 'balanced approach', whereby, instead of the aircraft being assessed, the noise situation at each individual airport is assessed and suitable restrictions are introduced. Apart from this general reservation – and after five years these provisions will be reviewed – we as a committee believe that we should implement the international agreements reached in Montreal, along with this approach of finding a balanced solution for each airport. This kind of noise protection, which will vary from airport to airport, at the same time makes it possible for us to repeal the hushkit regulation. We would have got into some difficulties with the USA and other third countries on account of this hushkit regulation, because from 1 April of this year the landing rights of these aircraft would automatically have been suspended. Thanks to the new balanced approach, which we have had since Montreal, we can do without the hushkit regulation and thus end the conflict with the USA, but here I also want to say loud and clear that the Americans should not forget to withdraw their Article 84 complaints if we withdraw our hushkit regulation. Because of the 1 April limit, we had to process the legislation quickly, and I have to say that our efforts have been very successful. There were some initial difficulties determining responsibility for the dossier with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but we agreed that the Environment Committee would draft an opinion. We incorporated this in our report and held an informal trilogue procedure with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, thus avoiding any dispute between the environment and transport areas in this House. I should like to thank the Vice-President and also the Council representatives very much for enabling the informal trilogue to reach a satisfactory conclusion. I should like to inform the House that there are two technical amendments which I will be tabling tomorrow, because in our haste we allowed two editorial errors to slip in. There are discrepancies between what we agreed with the Council and what the amendments actually say. But we will make the necessary corrections. On the substance, I should like to point out that we in Parliament have been successful on two central points. We have succeeded in changing the definition of the city airport. Until now airports have only been classified as city airports if there has been another alternative airport nearby. This has meant that there have been hardly any city airports. We have extended this definition by leaving out the alternative airport requirement. However, we did not get too carried away, so as to avoid a conflict with the Americans, and have said, city airports are airports as defined in Annex I. This can be amended by the Member States and the Commission in the committee procedure. This gives us the possibility of introducing more stringent rules on noise protection in particularly noisy areas and at particularly noisy airports. However, and here I turn to my socialist friends in this room, the general call to increase the limit from -5 EPNdB to -8 EPNdB would lead to a conflict with the USA and would also cause internal difficulties, because the Member States are not at all willing to accept more stringent standards, and at the moment the airports do not want these either. This means that we should actually stick to -5 here. In difficult situations we can use the definition of the city airport as a way out. That is why I urge the House not to support Amendments Nos 21 and 22 so as not to jeopardise the compromise with the Council. Secondly – and this is also for all of the environmentally-friendly Members of this House – we have obtained the Council's agreement that we already state now, in respect of the review in five years' time, that after these five years we should seek to establish a more stringent limit than -5. This means that we have sent out a clear signal that we want to take account of public sensitivities and public health. But the same public wants to go on holiday; the same public wants to fly to the European Parliament. We therefore need to reach a compromise between the interests of the people who want to fly and the interests of those who live near airports. I believe that we have found that compromise. I would earnestly request that tomorrow the whole House convincingly approve the measures that we negotiated with the Council with the help of the Commission's conciliation services, because then we can conclude this difficult issue – which is so important in terms of foreign policy – at first reading.

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would simply like to pose two questions to supplement the comments made by Mr Hatzidakis. If we call for new instruments, the question we will be asked is this: What are we doing with the existing instruments, and why are they not sufficient? That is the reason for my two supplementary questions. Firstly: Do we not already have the option of taking action against Switzerland? I believe that what Switzerland has done with regard to the restructuring of Swissair into Crossair, Swiss Airlines or whatever is clearly a subsidy case. Even if the treaty has not yet been ratified, there must be opportunities outside the treaty to proceed against Switzerland. When will you do so? Secondly: If we take action against unfair practices relating to ticket dumping outside the EU, can you tell us what you propose to do to combat internal price dumping within the European Union in the immediate future? There are increasingly frequent cases of airlines offering tickets below cost price in order to control the market. Do you intend to tackle this problem as well?
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen – at least those of you who are still here – the PPE-DE group supports the entire content of Mr Hatzidakis' report. We take the view that we may well support the Commission's proposal in principle, but that we do want to bring about some changes on a few points. The traffic safety issue is, of course, decisive, and we need this regulation because traffic safety is not bound by national borders and heavy goods vehicles do, indeed, cross them. In principle, we also need speed limitation devices for smaller vehicles, as we have had good experience of speed limitation devices in heavy lorries. It is because these HGVs travel across borders everywhere that we need European regulations. However, Madam Vice-President, we have to introduce the regulations in a slightly refined form and with longer time limits, for we are dealing here with major economic burdens laid on small and medium-sized enterprises. We should therefore be more generous in the transitional provisions, in order that the burden on the economy may not be allowed to be too great. Let me conclude by appealing to the Social Democrats and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, who is herself a great expert on traffic safety. As our Amendment No 12 demands, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, we need different speeds for small and large lorries. So we are again asking you to support our Amendment No 12, so that we can permit a speed of 110 kph for smaller commercial vehicles. If we impose the same speed limit on all HGVs, we are pre-programming traffic jams into the motorway system. If we are to ensure traffic flow, we must make it possible for smaller vehicles to overtake. With that in mind, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I ask you to support our amendment. We will then have a great piece of legislation!
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, Madam Vice-President and dear fellow-believers – I can call you that, because all of those sitting here are those who have moved this project forward over the years and who are committed to making ships safe. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, I would like to observe – it being two years since the Erika disaster – that we may be a little late with the adoption of this legislative package, but we have not done at all badly in terms of keeping to the timetable if you consider the difficulties that have been involved. Even then, two areas of the legislation have involved us having to go through a second reading and the conciliation procedure. Today, we can see that, on the basis of the Commission's initial proposals submitted two years ago now after the tanker crashed, our joint efforts have brought progress, and I again wish to thank you, Commissioner de Palacio, for the committed support you and your colleagues gave us in the conciliation process. By means both of these two results from the conciliation process and the common position, we have significantly increased not only the safety of ships, but also that of their crews, the environment and of people who live in coastal regions. I believe that enhanced port state control, more stringent regulations for classification societies and the progressive introduction of double hull tankers mean that we really have moved ahead in preventing accidents like that of the Erika, or at least alleviating their consequences. Commissioner, I would like to say this about port state control. I believe it was a good thing that, in the conciliation process, we – and especially Mark Watts – insisted on sorting out the ‘black box’ issue now. You will see that the ‘Erika II’ package does not quite go that far. I hope it soon will do, but you will be aware that it is still causing a few difficulties. That being so, we were right to insist on the requirement for a ‘black box’ being incorporated into the ‘Erika I’ package. My colleagues are aware that I am less happy about the result of the ship classification issue. We may well not have an upper limit, but we do have an appeal clause. I trust that the Commission will, after three years, produce a report submitting new proposals to us on how damage can be compensated for. This affects shipping companies, shipping agents, and classification societies – how about a fair compromise on who should shoulder the damage? We were, I think, very wise when it came to the common position on double hull tankers. We should let the whole world know that. We are always being accused of drafting European norms and disregarding worldwide conventions. No! We have accepted that the IMO sets the ground rules and have only made minor changes affecting implementation and time limits. What we have insisted on as regards implementation looks quite harmless in comparison with what the Americans forced through! I hope we will be able to adopt the second package next year. So, Commissioner, bring some pressure to bear on the Council! As far as the ‘cope fund’ compensation rule is concerned, we do not want to be kept waiting for the next five years. I am relying on you to push for this.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to comment on just two aspects, socially acceptable and economically reasonable restructuring in the aviation industry. Madam President-in-Office, you were too generous in your comments just now when you said that the Council had in fact responded consistently. I have my doubts about this, Madam President-in-Office, and I should like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the same subsidies – whether it be for insurance cover, whether it be compensation, or whether it be possible restructuring aid – are granted or not granted in all of the Member States. It is not acceptable for airlines to be supported in a particular way in one Member State and not in another when all are supposed to be competing fairly in an internal market. This cannot work. We want to establish fair terms of competition between the airlines. As President-in-Office of the Council you must ensure that this is the case and you, Commissioner, must, if necessary, take the Member States to court if there are distortions of competition here which destroy the internal market. Secondly, Madam President-in-Office, you rightly referred to the fact that restructuring is necessary. Probably there will be a number of larger global players and some regional airlines. They cannot be bound to Member State A or Member State B. We need a functioning European and global air transport market. This can only happen, Madam President-in-Office, if the Member States cede their responsibilities for take-off and landing rights to the Community and if we administer the take-off and landing rights together. Only then can we give our airlines a chance to compete on fair terms in the global market. I would earnestly request that in the next few weeks you do all you can to bring your influence to bear on your Member States on these two points. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my side has admittedly lost in a key vote, but the process must continue. We must now ensure that the Council forms an opinion. If we prevaricate and postpone this issue, the Council can continue to hide behind its inaction. I therefore propose that we reject the rapporteur's motion and now hold the final vote so that the ball is the Council's court. We still have the second reading and the mediation process. A delay at this point will not help: we want to move forward on this issue, and so I ask you to reject Mr Meijer's motion. (Applause)

Mr President, now that we have adopted Amendments Nos 48 and 49, I would like to ask the Liberal Group whether Amendment No 47 automatically lapses. That is my question, as we have agreed that the Commission must put forward appropriate proposals. I assume that Amendment No 47 now lapses.
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we should begin by saying to those watching us, who have found their way here in greater numbers than we MEPs, that we do not differ as regards our objective. We all want the best possible local public transport at the lowest cost to taxpayers and passengers. That is our common objective. We now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction. If your proposal is propaganda from the left of this House for the right of communities and regions to exercise free choice, then I can only say that the past fourteen years have demonstrated that free choice is to the citizens' disadvantage. What, then, is the position? In most towns and communities, services by the communities are being reduced and the subsidies are on the up and up. So the reality is that we cannot carry on with the present system if we want a good, efficient, public transport service at local and regional level. So we say we must put them out to tender, so that citizens get the best modern buses at the best price, with the best quality, and arriving as often as possible. That is the objective we have set. I can tell the gentleman from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities that, secondly, there is the Community Treaty, the Treaty on the European Community, in which it is stated that everyone shall have the right to provide services. Freedom of services can be restricted only on the basis of a greater good. The free will of a village community is not sufficient to say that one should limit the freedom of services under Community law in village A or village B. You need carefully-controlled legislation to be able to limit the freedom of services by reason of a higher good. That is what we are doing. If, though, you give communities back their free choice, you are suspending the justification for limiting the freedom of services, so, no matter what we agree on, be it journey times or whatever else, we need a proper framework for a controlled competitive order, and the free choice you propose undermines that, as we need sensible Community regulations to limit the freedom of services. (Applause)

rapporteur. – (DE)
 Mr President, the Commission proposal for a decision on market access to port services should be considered and appreciated as part of the comprehensive Commission communication on improved quality of services in ports. This communication was to draw conclusions from the positions of Parliament and of the Council on the Commission's 1997 Green Paper. When we consider the past weeks, we must observe that, whilst the European Parliament was in 1999 still able to agree by a large majority on a position on the Green Paper, the present Commission proposal, which is only intended to regulate market access to services in individual ports, has aroused a great deal of controversy in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as attested by the result of the vote on the report – 26 in favour, 21 against and 11 abstentions. So I hope that today's debate and tomorrow's vote will produce a clear position from this House, something in which I intend to play my part. For if we cannot work out a clear position at first reading stage, the Council then has the last word. We do not want to trust the Council to that extent, but rather we want to pull our own weight. In Committee, the majority supported the Commission's desire to adopt only regulations on competition in individual ports and include in this all service providers. The report is, though, ambiguous on one point, that is, on whether pilot services should fall within the scope of the decision. On the one hand, Amendment No 14 in the Committee's report states that pilot services are not to be affected by the provisions, but the application to delete pilot services from the appendix to the opinion, which alone defines the opinion's scope, was not accepted. That being the case, we, as Parliament, must give a clear lead tomorrow. Among the other amendments in the Committee's report, I would like in particular to highlight the fundamental extension of the scope of the proposal to include port access, be it by sea routes or canals, likewise a more restrictive definition of self-handling and the abandonment of the requirement for at least two service providers per category of cargo handling, likewise the requirement we have incorporated into the opinion, that, when tenders are invited, the new service provider should compensate its predecessor for the investments. A minority in the Committee tried to highlight, above all, the Commission's failure to comply with Parliament's 1999 demand for conditions for fair competition between ports in the EU, and produce a proposal for a regulation to create them. The Commission has produced neither a transparency study nor guidelines for the monitoring of aid. A minority in the Committee therefore proposed the adoption of new regulations on transparency in financial relations between ports and State offices and also on permissible State aid measures for ports, the intention being to provide legal protection for ports and also to prevent excessive aid provision. For me personally, this is very much about our need to agree tomorrow on this transparency issue, for the issue of transparency and fair conditions for competition between ports is crucial to the ports' ability to function. All of us have repeatedly emphasised that ports play a central role in European transport policy, with 70% of foreign trade and 30% of trade within the Community passing through them. They are significant junctions, and they must work well. I believe that nobody need fear transparency, which leads to fair conditions for competition. That characteristic and criterion is, I believe, a good basis for a real increase in the efficiency of ports. In that spirit, I hope we will have a good discussion this afternoon and that this House will vote wisely tomorrow.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have the honour to speak for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. I would like to start by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that nearly all the amendments produced by this committee were adopted. We have reinstated the substance of the budget estimates for regional and transport policy that you, Commissioner, proposed. I really must appeal to the Council not to be such a two-faced split personality. It is not tolerable for a great hullaballoo to have been made at the Göteborg Summit about our desire for a sustainable transport policy, only for the Council to cut resources in the area of sustainable mobility.
 This sort of ambiguity cannot go on, and we hope that the Council will admit that. If you want to have a rational, environmentally responsible transport policy, you cannot cut funds that are allocated for that purpose. My main point, though, is to do with tourism, something which did not, unfortunately, meet with favour in the Committee on Budgets. I would, though, just ask you to think again about it. We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe. You all know about the debate over many years about the 'Philoxenia' programme to attract tourist from overseas, with its slogan ‘tourists to Europe’. This topic has taken on a whole new dimension since 11 September. Not only are the airlines getting 20%-30% fewer customers, but so are hotels in Brussels, Berlin and in all European cities. The same is true of restaurants, souvenir shops and boutiques. We are seeing a massive slump in tourism, specifically from the USA and Canada. This situation is leading to major difficulties in the economy and putting jobs at risk. I put it to the Council and the Commission that, if we are to discuss the consequences of 11 September next month, we should re-examine the question of what we are to do to promote tourism in Europe.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, thank you for giving us this interim report now. We are dissatisfied with the Member States, which have practically left you in the lurch over the last eighteen months. The interim report on trans-European transport networks has been overdue since 1999. We thank you for presenting it now. So, to our first question: in your report, you make it clear that you want to add new elements, but that you also want to insist on existing projects which the Member States are still working on – such as the Brenner Tunnel – now at last being finished. I would therefore ask you how we are together to ensure, even with a possible change to the financial arrangements, that older projects as important as the Brenner Tunnel, but also new ones such as the Franco-Spanish link across the Pyrenees, or the fixed Femarn Belt link between Denmark and Germany actually get built? Madam Vice-President, you have already alluded to my second question: when are you going to expound to us in committee or in this House what your policy will be on combating new competition in the form of subsidised air travel? Alternatively, the question arises of how the airlines can be helped after the tragic events of 11 September.

 Madam President, of course Mr Swoboda is entitled to receive an accurate reply. I just want to ask your services to give it on the basis of the midday debate. Not to be too blunt about it, I had the feeling that Mr Swoboda, on the day itself, tried to use an amendment of the Minutes to change the outcome of this House's vote. For this reason, I ask that the midday debate should be taken as the basis of any answer your services give to Mr Swoboda, and please be so kind as to let me have a copy of it. I am quite sure that your services understood perfectly well what this House had in mind!

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we must also draw conclusions as regards civil aviation. We need to take steps to prevent similar terrorist attacks again taking place in or from the air. In the immediate future we need increased security for air travellers, preferably at international level. Let us each, though, start with our airports at home. We need stricter checks on luggage and hand luggage. We need tighter checks on airport workers. Above all, it will not be enough for controls at airports to be more stringent today and tomorrow if, in six months' time, they have been relaxed again in certain parts of Europe. No, we need strict controls on a permanent basis. Looking at specific cases, there is probably a need for armed flight attendants on certain routes, and we must consider the need to secure the cockpit against terrorist attacks, for we must prevent aircraft becoming the biggest weapons in the world. Although the safety of passengers is our primary concern, our secondary concern is that, at present, the number of passengers carried by airlines is showing a massive decrease. We must keep an eye on this situation. Is the number of passengers falling as a consequence of the terrorist attacks, or because of market conditions or structural factors? As we read in today's newspapers, certain governments are demanding subsidies and yet more subsidies, but these cannot be the solution. My group rejects subsidies for airlines. We must give thought to how we can help them. We can do this by coming to an agreement on code sharing and by permitting the restructuring of the companies, along with mergers and 
acquisitions. This would be a more elegant solution, keeping them competitive, but we must not pay out subsidies indiscriminately The situation can, of course, change. If the USA supports its airlines to the tune of massive amounts, then we will have to see what effect that has on the transatlantic market. Under such circumstances, we will not be able simply to leave our airlines on the outside looking in, but let us be clear-sighted about this. First of all, however, we need increased security for passengers.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too will take up your suggestion that this issue should be discussed without taboos. I do not believe that there is actually anybody in this House who is opposed to a cohesion policy. The question we must ask ourselves is whether a cohesion policy would not be better conducted without a Cohesion Fund. There are two problems, the first being that, if the accessions were to take place, then, logically, all the acceding States, being the poorest countries and States, would have to join the Cohesion Fund. You cannot say that there is a regional policy for all, a Cohesion Fund for four countries and all the rest can fit in somewhere else! No, so if the Cohesion Fund were to be maintained, it would have to apply to all the acceding countries. It is my personal view, however, that cohesion policy can be carried on better through the medium of general regional and structural policy and without a Cohesion Fund, as the Cohesion Fund seems to me to suffer from the drawback that it turns its attention to States rather than to regions. It is not the States that we want to support, however, but disadvantaged regions. It is for this reason, Commissioner, that I believe this issue should again be considered very carefully. I believe, secondly, that we too should, as you have always said, distinguish between substantial reforms and the question of how much money we want to end up spending on them. We must, in my view, come to a quick decision about the substance, as the acceding States have a right to be told before 2002/2003 what the cohesion policy situation is going to be if they are Members by then. Commissioner, I am not sure that I understood you right: I find your model good in itself. You are saying that there are standard criteria for all regions – one or two, shall we say – then there is phasing out for the regions that used to be supported but no longer can be because of the new criteria or simply because there is no more money. The question now arises: by what criteria should support actually be given in future? I myself would be prepared to talk in terms of one or two, or even three, criteria. I have, though, the slight suspicion – which you hinted at earlier – that there will subsequently be ten. So one takes a look to see what criterion fits the region. Oh look, there are a few mountains, so this is a mountain region. And this place has island status, so we shall call it an island region! I think it better to take any old percentage – GDP plus, perhaps, the unemployment situation, for example. If one takes that a step further and says that the balance of the sexes or the standard of education of men and women are to be counted as general criteria, then – if I may say so – things get a bit jumbled. So please let us carry on our discussions, as you said you would. We are on your side and look forward to continuing the debate with you.

 Mr President, it is intolerable that people should embark on another debate when the speaking time has expired and the Commissioner has spoken. I would ask you to prevent this in future, otherwise I too would like to speak for another two minutes. As it is, I can only say that the Commissioner has replied very well to all our questions and that we are very grateful to him.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully. Parliament did indeed make a slightly contradictory decision yesterday, I repeat a slightly contradictory decision. We adopted the Commission proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of 303 votes to 253. The proposal says that the previous upper ceiling is to be abolished. Parliament approved this by a clear majority. In my view, item 4 has been included because of a faux pas
 by a number of colleagues. However, there is still no material contradiction here because we also call on the Commission in item 4 to maintain an upper ceiling until the ecopoint system expires. In other words, we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the Commission proposal. If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well. The second call in item 4 is a call for the Commission to reflect. What the Commission does in this case, whether it proposes a new upper ceiling or no upper ceiling, is up to the Commission. We did not, as you will see if you read the second clause, call for the old upper ceiling; we said the Commission might like to consider setting a new, reasonable upper ceiling. However, this faux pas
 was carried by a majority. All that means, however, is that the Commission has been asked to reflect and submit an opinion to Parliament once it has done so. Parliament's clear position was, is, and remains – and in this respect there is nothing to correct, Mr Swoboda – that we approved the Commission's position yesterday by a large majority and I should like to confirm as much.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, first I should like to join Ojeda Sanz in thanking Mr Collins for his excellent report and Mr Schmitt for his excellent report. Both have presented us with a magnum opus
. As far as the question of aviation safety is concerned, Commissioner, you have now presented us with a proposal on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation and creating a European Aviation Safety Agency long after the single market was completed and other Commissioners had let the subject drop. This will at last allow us to replace the safety regulations adopted by bureaucrats in the Member States with uniform, European provisions accepted by Parliament. At last we can create a truly uniform European area of safety in the European skies. We hope that safety will be enhanced by strict and uniform controls. In this respect we support your proposal. The purpose of the amendments proposed by the committee, as Mr Schmitt rightly said, is to strengthen the technical independence of the European Aviation Safety Agency still further, without wanting to diminish your personal parliamentary responsibility. We trust that this agency will be able to start work in time to grant the symbol of the independent European aviation industry, namely the new Airbus A380, a joint project involving numerous employees, numerous engineers and numerous workers in European countries, the first uniform certification for European airspace. If it does, then I think we will have done both the aviation industry and safety a huge service.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to get one thing straight here. This hypothesis, that the Community is breaking Treaty law is simply nonsense. Treaty law makes provision for adjustment and this proposal adjusts just one point of the law. So it is not a question of breaking Treaty law. The non-attached member is moaning that we are not treating the environment properly and is calling for environmental protection. Well my question to my fellow Austrian member is this: when will you stump up the money for the Brenner base tunnel? Then you would be doing something for environmental protection. We are, in fact, taking far too long about implementing the Brenner base tunnel. That is the only real solution to the problem of transit traffic in the Alps. Instead of bandying fine words, Madam, you would do well to push ahead with plans for the base tunnel and stump up the money. That would be your job in a government in which you are represented. We do not need vox pops! Mr Stockmann made a great number of valid points, namely that the main objective, to reduce NOx emissions, has in fact almost been achieved and that the 108% clause is disproportionate and inaccurate. Mr Stockmann, vote with us tomorrow in favour of the Commission proposal and you will achieve exactly what you want to achieve. I can understand that you do not want to stab your Austrian rapporteur in the back, but consider carefully how you intend to vote tomorrow. Vote in favour of the Commission proposal. Just two more brief comments. If we maintain this clause, there will be no change in real freight volumes; instead the transit journeys which are no longer possible will be replaced by a journey using one haulier into Austria, transhipment and a journey using another haulier out of Austria. In other words, transit would be split, we would have more exhaust emissions and more costs to consumers. That is not the solution. The solution is to build the Brenner base tunnel so that we can shift freight from the roads to the railways in the long term. That is what we should be fighting for.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I too have to pour some cold water on the matter, since as I see it the Swedish presidency failed in two ways, because it did not manage to settle the dispute between two Member States over Gibraltar and thus free up the logjam in European air transport policy. The public finds it incomprehensible that although important legislative projects like the one on increased compensation arrangements for overbooking in passenger air transport was negotiated in Council, they have not been adopted. It is just as incomprehensible that important legislative initiatives like the creation of a single European sky are already blocked within the Commission. Mr President-in-Office, this would have been a good example of an area where the Council could have done something, because everyone knows that disputes like the one over Gibraltar cannot be settled at ministerial level, between transport ministers. It is a job for the top man, but in this case the top men have failed on two counts. I do hope at least that the minutes of the Göteborg Summit are factually correct. I say that because the Göteborg minutes say that the Council hopes that this dispute over Gibraltar can be settled over the next few weeks. So we are keen to see if a result will be forthcoming at least two weeks after the Swedish presidency. Commissioner, I also have a request for the Commission, an urgent appeal in fact. The Commission absolutely must adopt the legislative initiative on the creation of a single European sky before the summer break and forward it to the Council and Parliament. You know as well as we do that the many delays, the incidences of planes circling above the ground, are not just annoying for the public, because of delays in reaching their holiday destinations, and because of business appointments that cannot be kept. It is also expensive. You know just as well as we do that the ridiculous combustion of air fuel in the sky is environmentally unacceptable. That is why we need a sensible European system to bring an end to these delays. We look forward to seeing your proposal on this before the summer is out.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, may I again thank the three rapporteurs on behalf of my group. Even if the debate has shown that one group is perhaps not completely satisfied on one or two points, we must admit that all three reports were adopted either unanimously or by a large majority in committee and we should maintain this majority in tomorrow's vote. I think Parliament has put a very good package together in its position on Erika II and we should stick to it. I also think, to pick up on some of the comments made, starting with the comments made by the previous speaker and my colleague's comments on the compensation fund, that we are not prevaricating. All we are saying is that it is just not on for Member States to maintain to the outside world that they support compensation regulations and then only ratify quite basic compensation regulations. With the Esclopé report, we have included the fact that we want regulations for both oil pollution and for pollution from dangerous or harmful substances. The Council is perfectly at liberty to prove to us at second reading that it is prepared to push ahead with ratification or find an alternative. But it is just not on to say: you are blocking our compensation regulation, when they have no intention of doing anything about pollution from dangerous or harmful substances. In this respect, we must put on the pressure and say that we want a general regulation because there is a great deal of maritime pollution, not just from oil, but also from chemicals and other substances. If the Council knows of a better way, then we are quite prepared to take it. And you too, Madam Vice-President, if you know of a better way, then we are quite prepared to go to a second reading. We also have an open mind about international regulations. If the IMO wants to find a global solution to the problem within the next six months and actually does so, then we will gladly withdraw this Commission proposal. But all I can say is that, the same thing always happens; we always have to put on the pressure first and adopt our own legislation before any global regulations are passed, which is why we must push ahead here. One last comment on the Mastorakis report. We cannot say on the one hand that the agency should be independent, and then say that Parliament should have a say on the Administrative Board. That is a contradiction in terms. We want an independent authority but, in a democracy, any executive, even a subordinate authority, must be answerable to parliament. This will only happen if the agency is not completely independent of the Commission. We here in Parliament shall come down on the Commissioner if the agency makes mistakes. And we shall not be satisfied with the agency director's head. If something goes wrong in the agency, it will be your charming head that we are after, Madam Vice-President. That is parliamentarianism, which is why the agency must be independent, but under the responsibility of the Commission, and why we and not some experts appointed to the Administrative Board must exercise the right of control. We are your partners, Commissioner, and we shall get along just fine.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with what the committee chairman has just said: the ASEM process is an important framework for dialogue between EU states and Asian states. But, quite honestly, we should also admit that the results of the ASEM III Summit in Seoul last year were not so terribly significant. Many assertions remained very vague and if you look at how many of them have been put into practice you will see that we actually still have work to do on many of them. In this respect I fully share the views of our committee chairman. Commissioner, I think that we are acting as allies when we ask you to table a report on the preparations for ASEM IV, so that both of us – the Commission and Parliament – as we say in Hamburg, have a bit of butter with our fish, that is, actually introduce some substance into the preparations for ASEM IV in Copenhagen next year. We would ask you to provide us with a very substantial report as soon as possible so that we can debate with you, but also with the Council, which areas further negotiations should really focus on. Allow me to make one additional comment. I should like to take up once more what Mr Brok said about conflict prevention, but also about conflict resolution. We are in the business of helping each other. I need only recall that the Japanese donate a considerable amount of development aid to south-eastern Europe – our area – so as to express their solidarity with us on matters of security policy, and we should not therefore shy away from taking part in discussions about conflict resolution or providing assistance in this respect either, whether it be in China, Taiwan, North Korea or South Korea. There is one further comment which is on the tip of my tongue, Commissioner. Consider the following: this initiative involves ten Asian countries and fifteen European countries. There will soon be eighteen or twenty countries on the European side. We should maintain a balance. That is why I think it is important for us to consider to what extent it might be possible for the Asian side also to admit more members. I believe, for example, that a country like India, which is significant on the one hand because of its abundant population but on the other because of its democratic structure and experience, could be a good partner. Perhaps you could discuss this briefly with your Asian colleagues even in the run-up to ASEM IV, so that we have balanced coverage of both geographical areas. I think that we agree here: we need to make it clear in the political discussion that Asia's relations with Europe are of decisive importance, and we should help each other in this respect. In conclusion, I should once again like to refer to Mr Brok's opening comments. Relations between states are of course negotiated formally by their governments. But I would say to the Heads of State and Government: civil servants and ministers need the support of members of parliament. That is why the committee's idea… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, may I firstly, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, thank our rapporteur. Once again he has tabled an excellent report on the external service and I hope, Commissioner, that you will listen to me and Mr Galeote Quecedo and that in the spirit of his report you will be so good as to give clear answers. I believe – in fact we agree on this – that we need to leave history behind. We need to consider the current functions of the delegation, based on the functions of the Union. We have of course had Maastricht with the second pillar, the foreign and security policy, and we now have increased responsibilities in the field of world trade policy. We therefore need to make sure that delegations are opened in all of those cities which are important political and economic partners. This brings me back, Commissioner, to the debate of a few minutes ago. I believe that it is precisely in Asia that we need more delegations. Mr Galeote's report proposes Singapore and Taipei as the places where we should open delegations immediately. Coming back to Mr Sakellariou's comments on Taipei, Taiwan is the EU's fourth largest trading partner and an example of how a society in Asia can be transformed, at its own instigation, from an authoritarian regime into a living parliamentary democracy. This is an excellent illustration of the fact that the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights work in Asia and are even something which the countries themselves want. That is why it is high time that we also open an office in Taiwan. So, delegations in Singapore and Taiwan, and Mr Galeote also mentioned other regions in the world. What I believe is important now is for you, when you send us the next document, to provide a clear list of countries and dates – in months and years – indicating where and when you think that delegations should be opened. If there is no money then say: we need the money. Then we will have to have a chat about it here and see whether we can have a friendly argument with Mr Bourlanges and win him over. But we need a report in which it clearly states which countries and in which month of which year, and then we will also be able to lend you our support and build up a decent external service for the Union.

Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the transatlantic dialogue must be extended to encompass global transport policy because both the USA and we Europeans bear a special responsibility for greater safety in the air and at sea, better environmental protection and fair competition and fair trade practices. Our primary objective must be to adopt reasonable harmonised provisions in order to develop a transatlantic transport market – be it in air or sea transport – and to work towards global regulations based on harmonised regulations between the USA and Europe, for example in the area of air traffic noise. We do not want to end up at loggerheads with the Americans again over hushkitted aeroplanes; on the contrary, we must endeavour to regulate environmental protection and safety standards in advance, jointly and proactively. This is not just a task for the Commission and the US Administration. We must try, as part of the transatlantic parliamentary dialogue, to organise specialist debates between transport experts in the American congress and the European Parliament so as to avoid political pressure between the administrations or, as the result of pressure from lobbyists, by the administrations. We must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety. This will greatly benefit our people, avoid conflicts between the USA and Europe and could form the basis for an overall joint solution. (Applause)

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank both rapporteurs. After months of work, Mr Watts and Mr Larrea have succeeded in reaching consensus on both reports in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We had a united stance at the first reading and we will be united again for the second reading tomorrow. For this reason, I do not want to say very much at all about the information they have presented on this matter, but will move straight on to procedure. I regret, however, that the Council again rejected our offer to carry out an informal conciliation procedure so that the Erika I package could be concluded with regard to these two directives in the next few days. Our offer was to seek a compromise prior to the official second reading in Parliament and then jointly conclude the dossier in the next few days with the confirmation of the Council. I think it is a pity that this cannot be achieved. There are two remarks I would like to make here: first I would like to mention that I had to negotiate hard with Mr Gayssot, the French Transport Minister, like my colleagues on the railway package, but at least he was available and we were able to speak. The Swedish Presidency was not there at all. As the European Parliament, we should pass a resolution that unofficial three-way discussions should only be agreed to if the minister participates. After all, we do not send our conseillers 
to an informal conciliation procedure; we try to bring our own personal weight to bear. The second practical point concerns what the Council offered us twice as a compromise, which in fact was an insult to our intelligence, since it was not a compromise at all. I only hope that the Council, and the Swedish Presidency, may yet think better of it. We are prepared to continue negotiating until the end of June, after this resolution and after the Council has passed a resolution on this matter, in order to reach an outcome quickly in a Conciliation Procedure. I have an important request to make of you, Madam Vice-President: we as the European Parliament represent the concerns of the Commission in this matter, as the Commission too wants to introduce a voyage data recorder. However, as Parliament we are very much afraid, no, we are sure, that the Council is always putting the brakes on us and delaying this matter so that we cannot move on to Erika II. If the Commission is in favour of voyage data recorders, it should support us in the Watts report. The same goes for the Ortuondo Larrea report. We are on the side of the Commission, which has proposed maximum limits. When we suggest as a compromise setting minimum and maximum amounts for the financial liability of classification societies, then this is a fair compromise. Mr President, I hope that the Commission not only has its eye on the Council, but that it will honour its promise, bearing in mind that the Commission and Parliament are natural allies.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, first allow me to thank my fellow member, Felipe Camisón Asensio, for his report on behalf of my Group. He has drafted it very carefully. He did not succumb to the temptation to open the door to subsidies still wider; on the contrary, he kept it where the vice-president suggested. The vice-president and Mr Camisón Asensio were streets ahead of the European Council. We may, nonetheless, quote the European Council. The European Council stated in Stockholm that we need to reduce the scope of state aid in the European Union and to make the aid system more transparent. And that is precisely the objective here. I think that, in replacing the old Regulation No 1107/70 with the new regulation, we have indeed made the system more transparent. As regards the use to which it is put, I believe that aid only compensates so-called unpaid costs in connection with the development and use of transport infrastructures. This poses a problem, because it is not clear exactly what external costs are. Let me give you an example: the theory that it is always better, for the purpose of environmental protection, to shift freight from the road to the railway does not automatically apply. We are debating noise in the vicinity of airports, we are in the process of banning night flights. Just think about when you hear a good old freight train in the middle of the night; it is loud, it stinks and the brakes squeal. What I mean is that, when it comes to questions such as "What are external costs? How can they be scientifically defined? And how can they be apportioned?", we still have our work cut out. I am delighted that the report says as much. It is work which the Commission has yet to do and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the Commissioner will be able to do it soon.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur. He has seen this difficult dossier, which involved an extremely difficult fight in the Council, through two institutions and the Conciliation Committee, and that is most important. Rapporteurs simply need to have the courage to stand their ground. He has demonstrated that courage and has been successful as a result. I join him in thanking the French Presidency of the Council, which endeavoured to find a compromise at the eleventh hour. I should like to thank the Vice-President and her officials for helping us to negotiate that compromise. So, in this respect, my warmest thanks to the Commission. I, too, shall endeavour to be brief on this lovely evening, hence just three points. First: we had to set ports, inland ports, sea ports and intermodal terminals in the right context within a text on trans-European networks, which is why we said they must be ports and inland ports which are connected to the hinterland, which form part of a network, and not individual ports, which may be very nice but which have no trans-European significance. I think that the classification which we have found together with the Council is a very good one. Secondly, we had to draw a dividing line between infrastructure and superstructure. To non-specialists that all sounds very complicated, but it is fundamental to the question of equality of competition between ports or to the question of inadmissible distortions of competition. First, it was important to clarify what we mean by infrastructure. So what must the state do and pay, without intervention on the part of the Community, without any notification requirements? A typical question might be: does dredging a harbour mouth have to be notified or not? This gave rise to a whole series of difficulties between the Member States and the Commission. But what was important was to clarify that superstructure is defined by reverting to infrastructure, in order to ensure that there is no competition-distorting aid. I think this was achieved very well. And a third point, if I may. Madam Vice-President, please bear in mind that this is the first time that Parliament has been able to codecide on priority projects in the codecision procedure. Because the wise Heads of State or Government said after Essen and Dublin that they would decide what priority projects are! What is Parliament here for? In this case, we have managed, with the rapporteur’s help, to ensure that the Council and Parliament decide jointly on priority projects and we should bear this in mind when it comes to the revision.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, my point concerns the liberalisation of postal services, which you too referred to, Madam President-in-Office. The postal services are one example of just how inefficient Council meetings are. It was decided in Lisbon to speed up the liberalisation of postal services. We adopted our position in the European Parliament before the end of the year, in the hope that the Council would adopt its common position by the end of the year. What happened? Not a thing! The Council did not adopt a common position. We should in fact admit to ourselves that the Council does not want to adopt a common position. Germany has decided to extend the post office monopoly because everything has ground to a halt in Europe. Madam President-in-Office, we call on you to ensure at the Stockholm Summit that the Heads of State and Government instruct their ministers to proceed with the liberalisation of postal services without delay. Only this will prove that Council meetings make any sense or any headway. And then you should pass a second resolution, Madam President-in-Office, stating that the Heads of State and Government must evaluate structural policy, post haste. We must be in a position to reform structural policy in 2003 at the latest, for two reasons. Firstly, because structural policy is extremely important to labour market policy in numerous countries and, secondly, because we have to tell candidate countries what to expect in the new period if they accede after 2005/2006. In this respect, Madam President-in-Office, please make sure that the summit passes specific resolutions on the liberalisation of postal services and the evaluation of the structural funds so that we can make headway for the period after 2006. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank you warmly for your excellent report. I am sure it will provoke solid, but also controversial discussion, and so I would just like to take this opportunity to stimulate debate a little with a two-fold question. The current system will actually remain in force until the year 2006. Given that we are negotiating with the candidate countries with the aim of their acceding in 2004/2005, how then, can we make it clear to them that, even if they join under the current conditions, they cannot rely on our being able to continue the system, in other words, how are we going to make them understand that irrespective of what they sign up to now, they are going to have to adapt to an amended cohesion policy? Secondly, perhaps you could allay a little the fears which prevail across a good many regions by explaining to us how is it going to be possible for the regions which may receive less support after 2007, regardless of the ceiling we apply, not to lose support and solidarity at a moment’s notice? How can we make it possible for them – as has, in fact, been done hitherto using the phasing out method – to achieve the upturn gradually, without their being dropped from the system straightaway? You may be able to assuage quite a number of fears with your answer.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen – who I see are rather thin on the ground – following tough, but fair, negotiations between the French Council Presidency and representatives of the European Parliament, we, Parliament that is, managed, on the evening of 22 November, to make clear progress in the Conciliation Procedure on the three fundamental directives on railway liberalisation – namely those concerning the further development of the railways, the licensing of railway undertakings and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity – such progress being towards the further opening-up of the railway sector. I will summarise the progress made in three points, and I would like to welcome you Madam Vice-President. We were able to get the Council’s agreement on three points. Firstly, it was agreed that all railway undertakings should definitively be granted rights of access to the entire rail networks of all Member States for international freight transport, by 2008 at the latest. In so doing, we ensured that from this point onwards, all Member States will be obliged not just to open the marked-out routes of the so-called new trans-European rail freight network, but also their network in its entirety, to the railway companies from the other EU States. Secondly, the exemption clause – originally planned by Austria – which would have enabled Member States to evade the strict European requirements emanating from the respective national regulation authority, has been dropped. As I see it, this means that across the EU, the national railway companies or their associated agencies will be the last ones to be entrusted with the licensing of railway undertakings, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity, or railway infrastructure charging, rather this will fall to agencies of a truly independent nature. So these are the two crucial components: the opening-up of all networks for cross-border traffic and the establishment of an independent regulatory authority in all Member States, so as to guarantee fair competition. Permit me just to say a few words about Mr Swoboda’s report. The third crucial component to be achieved in my view, is that we managed, by means of a new provision, to make a start on the long-term goal of applying the ‘user pays principle’ when it comes to the cost of railway infrastructure usage. In this way, we have ensured that infrastructure charges can be raised in the long term with a view to cost-effectiveness, so that the construction, maintenance and also development is funded by the user, and not by the tax payer at the end of the day. In other words, as I see it, we will still need, in the long run, to implement the separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management. But in any event, we need the network to be maintained by the users. That is why we must make it our long-term goal to cover costs through charges. As I see it, in taking these three essential steps, we are already breaking down the national, fixed railway structures and creating new possibilities for competition between the railway undertakings. Parliament has fought for this, in conjunction with the Commission. The Commission was not exactly enthusiastic to begin with, but it fought alongside us in the end, in a bid to achieve this liberalisation, and I would therefore like to say a special thank you to the Vice-President for her cooperation in the Conciliation Procedure. I believe that as a result, Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, has established the framework for an attractive railway sector, which will offer a wider range of customer-orientated, cross-border freight services in the future. After all, what we want is to modernise the railway sector by means of competition, so that, ultimately, more freight is transferred from road to rail. This is because it is absolutely vital, on environmental protection grounds, to get freight off the roads and onto the railways over long distances. Incidentally, the course taken by the Conciliation Procedure has again borne out the importance of the codecision procedure, and we have only had codecision rights in the transport sector since the Treaty of Amsterdam. Without the codecision procedure we would not have managed to break down the Council’s position. If you recall, the French President-in-Office of the Council had believed that following the first reading of the Council’s common position, all negotiations would come to an end, and we would have to accept the situation. But no, a fair Conciliation Procedure enabled us to make progress and achieve a single market, at least for cross-border freight traffic, with effect from the year 2008 at the latest. Permit me just to look ahead for a moment. It is simply not enough to only ever produce laws, directives and regulations, nor is it enough just to have them transposed into national law. My group calls upon the existing railway undertakings – and I see one is represented up on the platform, for which I am grateful – to take the necessary precautions now, so that they are in a position to make use of the new provisions when the European law that we are now in the process of adopting has to be transposed in the year 2003. Thus, for example, the Deutsche Bundesbahn
, perhaps in conjunction with the Dutch national railways or other railways, should truly exploit the opportunity to make cross-border freight traffic a reality. I believe this is where the traditional railways must really rise to the challenge of pushing through the opening-up of the market that we have created. If, however, the traditional railways do not exploit the new opportunities presented by liberalisation, then many industrial enterprises will consider doing business directly with small railway companies, using European law. They will be entitled to do so. There are 180 licensed railway companies in Germany, and they are licensed to operate wherever they wish, even if they have only operated on a regional basis hitherto. I therefore believe we should prevail upon all parties concerned, the railway companies and industry, to take the necessary precautionary measures without delay, and make use of the competition, so that more freight can be transferred from road to rail.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I rise in my capacity as Vice-President of the Japan delegation and welcome the new draft regulation, which at last creates a fundamental legal basis, all be it one which will initially only run to the year 2005, for the projects on promoting cooperation and trade relations. Firstly, I would like to echo Mrs Mann’s commendation of the Commissioner for the excellent cooperation we have had, but I would especially like to join the group of delegates present here today in praising your work, Mrs Mann, because it was no easy task and I know it has been a tripartite business, involving the Commission, the Member States and Parliament. We must try to find a reasonable basis, because we will only make progress in this matter if we work together. I believe that we have, in this new draft regulation, a solid basis for a political and economic debate with the industrialised states. That is why I do not want to restrict it to trade alone. I believe it is important to achieve a closer association with the industrialised countries of North America, the Far East and Australasia, and to step up our exchange activities. This is necessary if we are to press home to people again– including MEPs – the significance of Asia. I believe there are still some marked differences in this respect. There are some excellent programmes when it comes to Japan. I believe the Executive Training Programme in Japan is exemplary and could be adopted elsewhere, indeed there is now a similar project in Korea which is in its pilot phase. The Gateway to Japan project is also outstanding as a trade promotion project. Other industrialised countries could emulate it. Conversely, I believe we delegates should consider taking our example from the relations between the legislative bodies, the American Congress for example, and Asia, because contact between the European Parliament and Asia is not firmly established enough yet. I therefore believe we should seize on this example, in a bid to build closer relations between the two houses of the Japanese parliament and the European Parliament, and just as the Americans do, working from a legal basis, so should we use the same opportunities with regard to Asia. Permit me to close with a brief remark. Even though we have adopted this kind of division of responsibility, partly for reasons of experience, on account of the different legal basis, we should be aware, nonetheless, that we have very different styles of working. Take for example my area, Asia, which keeps me extremely busy. I believe we should underpin the ASEM Process much more firmly in political and parliamentary terms. One thing we must be sure to do is hold a conference for parliamentarians before the next ASEM meeting. So regardless as to what the legal situation is, Europe and Asia must grow closer together.

 Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I consider this regulation extremely important and after all the European Parliament has been calling for an improvement in aviation safety since 1987. That means we must also regulate the flight and rest times of the cockpit crew as of the cabin crew. I agree with the previous speakers that we should give the unions and the airlines a last chance to settle this issue between themselves, working jointly and pragmatically. Of course we have agreed that they must reach an agreement by May next year. Madam Vice-President, please tell your services that if they have not done so by the end of May we will no longer play the game that has been played for six years, namely with the Commission waiting for the parties to reach agreement. But they have not reached agreement. The Commission behaved very politely and did not make any proposals of its own. Either the parties agree by May, or we expect the Commission to put forward a proposal that we can incorporate in the second reading. For it is unacceptable not to regulate a question that is crucial to passenger safety, namely whether the captains, the crews, have had enough rest to be able to carry out their duties. These issues must be settled. Let me address a second point that caught my attention at the December Council meeting. If we adopt a position at first reading, in fact at Parliament's final vote tomorrow, then I insist as I am sure my colleagues will also do on the Council deciding a common position. It can wait till May, till the two parties have reached agreement. But in the interests of passenger safety in Europe we cannot accept no decisions being taken on aviation until the supposed settlement of the Gibraltar conflict. The Commission and Parliament should jointly see to that. (Applause)

 Mr President, I can only support the Commission in not presenting a Community regulation on blood alcohol content. My colleagues are holding a sham debate, a totally sham debate. The socialists and our group decided jointly a year ago, when the proposals from the previous period were taken up again, that we do not want Community legislation here. The point we make is this: we want checks. That is the crucial question, not what the law says. It is crucial to have on-the-spot checks. Here I can only reply to my UK colleague: if your police carried out checks over Christmas, it would take these people off the roads and prevent the accidents. So I can only repeat that the crucial factor is to check the blood alcohol level rather than to issue a Community regulation. That is why we will reject the first part of Amendment No 4. If it is nevertheless carried, my group will reject Mrs Petersen's entire resolution, because it is hypocritical to call for Community legislation when there is no need whatsoever for it. Talk to your countries. Most countries agree with the common view of this House that 0.5 parts per thousand is quite adequate, as the Commission rightly said. That is what we recommended to all these countries. The people you should talk to, Mr Watts, are those who do not apply that. So it is not a question of a sham debate or of what the law says; the police must carry out-on-the spot checks and pick out all the drunken drivers. That will give us the greatest road safety. Secondly, we will not accept Amendment No 6 either, with which the Greens are once again trying to start another sham debate, namely on a general speed limit of 120 km/h. We already have speed limits on most European roads. In my country we have speed limits on 95% of all roads. Where do the accidents happen? On the 95% of roads, because there are not enough speed checks there either. So, fewer laws and more checks will do more for road safety.
Jarzembowski (PPE-DE

 – Mr President, on a point of order. If I have understood my colleague correctly, then it is enough to have a recommendation that the UK Government will lower the blood-alcohol level.

 Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Costa, ladies and gentlemen, I want to give high praise to the rapporteur for his success in achieving a broad consensus with his report, after we have spent years in this House hotly debating the right way to charge for transport infrastructure costs. Commissioner, Vice-President, I hope that after the vote tomorrow you will peruse all the drafts for the White Paper on transport policy again and check whether they follow the same lines as proposed by this House. After all, normally the Commission's proposals always take account of the Member States' views, and perhaps in future they will also take more account of Parliament's views. I believe that the Costa report offers an opportunity to re-think some of the habits the various departments have grown so fond of. I also hope that we do not mix up the subject matter of the White Paper with the subject of the trans-European networks. We are about to review the trans-European networks; these are both important subjects. To present them to Parliament as a single package would, in my view, be extremely unwise since they are in fact separate subjects. Allow me to make just a few comments on the Costa report. Amendment No 1 makes it quite clear that we want use-based transport charging, which can be verified on the basis of the construction, expansion and improvement costs. That is the first issue. So there are two aims of which we must not lose sight when we harmonise these transport infrastructure charges. Firstly, we must finally achieve a single market in this area. For when you think that we still have enormous distortions of competition because of divergent fiscal and other charges between the Member States, a whole 8-9 years after the completion of the single market on 31 December 1992, then the question of equal competition is bound to arise. Secondly, we really all think that after the meteoric rises in oil prices over the past year, in whatever way we want to convert and achieve a more fair and environmentally compatible system, the total charge for undertakings must not rise. We do not want any forcing up of prices. Last point: in relation to external costs I have two requests. Firstly, about three years ago, Parliament decided in toto 
to work out on a scientific basis what the external costs actually are. How can they be calculated and how can they be charged? We never received that report. Secondly, we must differentiate when we calculate these external costs. To give just one example: congestion costs. It would be absurd to charge an undertaking for the fact that the drivers are stuck in a tail-back because the Member States have not expanded the roads, so that the undertaking not only has higher petrol and working costs but also has to pay additional charges to the Member State responsible for the congestion.

Madam President, I believe we must discuss this matter today, because we are prepared for it and are waiting to discuss it, but I wish to refute Mr Savary's arguments regarding the amendments. It is actually scandalous that these are not available in time for our debate. It is certainly important, to my mind, that we know which honourable Members have tabled which amendments. For that reason, conducting a debate without access to the amendments must remain an exceptional situation. It is an extremely unusual procedure, and what Sir Robert Atkins says is essentially correct. Unfortunately, however, we have now reached the point at which we can no longer defer this discussion. I therefore ask, Madam President, that we begin the debate, but let me put on record that this practice of conducting a debate in ignorance of the tabled amendments is a highly abnormal practice. (Applause)

Madam President, Commissioner, may I begin by reiterating my thanks to my honourable colleague Markus Ferber on behalf of our group, because he sought compromises within the committee and he found them. You know how difficult this issue is; it is laden with ideological overtones, sometimes from both sides. We therefore owe him our thanks for rallying a large majority behind a sound compromise. Our group agrees with the Commissioner and with the Lisbon meeting of the European Council, though not that of Nice, that further steps need to be taken to open the market in postal services. Competition in the postal sector, as it has done elsewhere, will ensure that we have a more effective and an affordable service for consumers. However, my group also takes the view that we as a Community and as Member States must naturally ensure that conditions are created for the provision of a universal service too. But, Mr Savary, the purpose of the universal service is to offer the postal services that people typically require and to offer them at affordable prices throughout the territory of the Member States. The purpose of the universal service is not to act as a citizens' advice bureau or to organise psychological counselling. The fact is that, in order to make a universal service possible, we are reserving a domain in which monopolies can operate. In other words, in this exceptional case we are deliberately excluding competition. But this exclusion must only apply to postal services and not to advisory services, social services or anything else. We cannot find any legal grounds for excluding competition from these other domains. So, if a Member State wants to have a nation-wide citizens' advice network, it should pay for it. When I buy a postage stamp, I should not be helping to finance a citizens' advice service in France or in any other countries. That would truly make a mockery of the universal service. Yes, we do want to guarantee a universal service, and, in order to do so, we must exclude competition from a certain area of the postal services. The great bone of contention in our committee and in the House as a whole is this: how large an area do we have to keep free of competition so that a decent universal postal service can be provided? I believe the compromise ceiling of 150 grammes that we have proposed, along with the application of the other criteria, constitute suitable next steps. For this reason, a majority of my group will be supporting this compromise too. The situation on the ground, of course, varies widely. Let me give you an example. The Belgian Post Office cannot claim to serve a country of vast dimensions, nor can it claim to serve a remote country on the periphery of Europe. Yet its postal services are disastrous, even though it has a reserved right to provide them. This is why we are giving the green light for the next step. May I also point out, Commissioner – and this is the second of the motions we have tabled – that we should like to have a report by 31 December on this next step that we are about to take, so that Parliament and the Council can jointly decide on further steps towards more open markets, and I also hope that you will be able to present a clear evaluation report in the year 2003, on the basis of which we can then initiate the next moves.

Mr President, I wish to reject these indiscriminate attacks against the majority of this House. We are trying hard to carry out modernisation and gradual liberalisation, and we do not deserve to be lectured here by you, Commissioner. You should at least thank us for taking our decision today, because this will enable you to find out in December whether the Council adheres to the line taken by the Lisbon European Council and decides in favour of your version of liberalisation, or ours. But to lecture us and then achieve nothing in the Council is a slightly hypocritical course of action, Commissioner. You really ought to listen to the majority of this House. (Applause)

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, may I congratulate you once again for having outlined the Erika II package in clear and comprehensible terms and especially the need for us to inspect vessels in transit – subject to the international law of the sea – rather than only checking vessels that dock in EU ports. These other ships which are only passing through EU waters can cause equally bad and even far worse pollution of our shorelines. So I believe this approach is absolutely correct. As far as liability is concerned, we must take a very careful look at that. The oil companies tell us they have a voluntary fund. This raises the question of whether we need a public fund. If you tell us that experience has shown the voluntary fund to be inadequate, which would be unfortunate, we shall then try to sort out this issue. Madam Vice-President, how do you rate the prospects of the Council taking a decision on the Erika I package in December? Parliament took its decision on 30 November; you presented a good document, and we decided quickly. How do you see the chances of the Council managing to adopt Erika I now, in December?

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me begin by thanking the four rapporteurs. The three reports from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were adopted either unanimously or by an overwhelming majority in committee. In other words, we discussed the issues objectively and arrived at a common position. For that reason, it is important that we stand by that position. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it was very honourable of you to ask at the last minute to have the votes on two of the directives postponed so that we can still reach an agreement. But I put it to you that this is a somewhat ambivalent move. First of all, we in Parliament were criticised for having caused a delay. The President of Parliament specially brought the debate and vote forward from the scheduled date in December to today's sitting. We have had no written statement from the Council which would have enabled us even to discuss a compromise. I believe your intentions are honourable, but we can only discuss negotiating outcomes that have been examined by the Council. To that extent, it is impossible to change anything, because we discussed this material meticulously in our committees, and it would be impossible to hammer out a compromise wording on the various issues that are particularly awkward, to have these compromises printed in eleven languages and to discuss them with our colleagues in time for next Tuesday. I can therefore only ask you to accept the directive and the regulation in the form in which Parliament adopts them at noon today. That would take us as close as possible to our common goal of increasing maritime safety without delay. The choice is yours. On those points where you feel unable to accept our proposals, produce a common position in December. Do not delay it in the Council. We are prepared to negotiate on proposed compromises for the second reading from January onwards, so that the second reading will be completed early next year, just like that. I should like to reiterate that the urgent action upon which you are now insisting is not necessary. For example, in the case of port state control, we certainly want tighter rules, unlike the Council. But even if we did not complete the process in December, we should certainly have taken a huge step forward, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if you managed to persuade the other States and your own administration to fulfil their obligations in matters of port state control under the old directive. So if you want to do something to improve safety at sea, recruit new inspectors, carry out stringent checks under the existing law, and we shall have achieved a resounding success. With regard to the liability of classification societies, which is a highly complex subject, we shall have to discuss this calmly and carefully. We have discussed the material thoroughly in committee, we have adopted our opinions by a large majority or unanimously, and Parliament should do likewise at noon today. If you achieve the same level of agreement in December, we shall be through to the next stage.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I think the House is so empty because we have proceeded apace this evening and some members who wished to speak have not yet arrived and are still dining. I would ask you, therefore, not to interpret the low turnout as an indication that the issue is not important. Commissioner, first I agree with your reading that the ASEM process is hugely important. It is of huge political and economic significance. I only wish that both this House and many of your colleagues in the Commission would see the importance of Asia's relations with Europe from the right perspective, and that includes the Union's fisheries policy – may my Spanish colleagues forgive me and with my excuses to Mr Fischler. If you take a long-term view of political and economic developments in our multi-polar world, then you will see that Asia's relations with Europe, and vice versa, are of paramount importance. In this respect we are extremely lucky that the summit in Seoul took place at all and that, with one or two exceptions, all the heads of government attended. That was highly significant. You are quite right that the Asian Summit was somewhat dominated, in the positive sense, by developments in both North and South Korea, with the result that more time was spent evaluating and qualifying the rapprochement 
on the Korean peninsular than on a real in-depth discussion of the Asia process. But we should be pleased that positive developments are taking place there. Allow me, however, to comment on the poor Council representative who will have to write up his protocol at some point: obviously the situation was awkward in Seoul due to the fact that some EU Member States have stopped exchanging ambassadors with North Korea and others have not. It would have been smarter – if we are to have a common foreign and security policy – if all 15 Member States had taken a joint decision to resume relations with North Korea at the same time and on the same terms, as opposed to this display of showmanship by some Heads of State and Government. It is good – I freely admit – that some agreement was reached on a framework programme for cooperation between Asia and Europe. But, Commissioner, have you in all honesty understood the substance of the framework agreement? I still have a great deal of difficulty really understanding the substance of what has been agreed for the next decade. And here I think that, what is important to Parliament – even if only a few of us are here, someone should read the protocol and we specialists will take it from there – is for it to be involved in the process of putting flesh on the bones of the framework for cooperation between Asia and Europe. I think, in any case, that Parliament conducts itself far too reactively. As we have such a good negotiating partner in you, Commissioner, we should try to agree on the content before Copenhagen and before the conferences and Parliament should start us thinking about how we can flesh out the framework which you have decided on. I am delighted that the European side took a clear stance on human rights. But we need to discuss the consequences of what that means at our leisure. I think it was an excellent political declaration but we still have a few problems here. I think that it is our job here in Parliament to follow up on what the European side generously included in the conclusions, namely cooperation between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the countries in Asia, following the first ASEM conference held in Strasbourg a few years ago. It is an important task and I can only hope that Parliament will initiate the second meeting next year before Copenhagen. We should arrange to hold it in Asia, given that the last meeting was held in Strasbourg. It is when you look at cooperation between Asia and Europe from the point of view of democracy or human rights that you see how important it is for us to cooperate more closely with parliaments in the Asian countries and bring about positive developments.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make three short suggestions about open dialogue. Firstly, a proposal for political dialogue. We have already spoken about Indonesia, East Timor and Burma. I would like to mention the situation between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. I believe we should make it clear that the election of the new Taiwanese President is a historical opportunity to overcome the differences on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and we should do this. As Europeans we should also, at long last, have the courage to open the EU liaison office in Taipei, because Taiwan is a major economic force with which we have very close relations. But there is the matter of political dialogue. My second point is that we should be economically open, and we also have to tackle difficult topics sometimes. We should take the opportunity of being in Seoul to stress once again that the subsidies Korea grants to its shipyards are unacceptable. They put jobs throughout the EU at risk. It is not acceptable that we assisted Korea during the ASEAN crisis by means of IMF loans and suchlike, only for Korea still to be subsidising its shipyards, which is creating unjustifiable problems for our own shipyards. My third point is one that affects not only us but also the countries of Asia. As has already been mentioned, we need an interparliamentary dialogue, a dialogue between the European Parliament and the parliaments of the 10 Asian states. You quite rightly mentioned that one of the key points at the Asia-Europe Summit will be the wide-ranging dialogue, that is to say the expression of various different interests on the part of Europe and Asia. It is not acceptable for these interests only to be the subject of exchanges between governments and officials, with academics and journalists generously being allowed to participate. Members of Parliament also need to take part in this process – this is no longer a question of pure foreign policy. These are all political issues which significantly affect the situation in individual countries, and so Members of Parliament must be involved in this. When the Japanese Members of Parliament come to see us in Strasbourg in November, Mr President, we will ask them to see if the next meeting between Members of the European Parliament and Members of Parliament from the Asian countries can, if at all possible, be organised in Japan.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk. He has consistently re-presented what we jointly agreed upon at first reading. He has translated it into a clear and easily understandable report. The main theme of this report is that if we are looking at European ports as part of the trans-European network, then we need a policy which provides for ports relevant to Europe's needs to be incorporated into that network. And they can only be relevant to Europe's needs if they are connected to other transport systems in the trans-European network. Furthermore, the small amount of support that we give to trans-European networks must in that case, of course, also be directed to port infrastructure and not just towards port superstructure. This report is quite clear on that point. The corresponding amendments were also unanimously adopted in committee. I would like to comment on two additional points. If we do not concentrate on those ports that are really relevant to export and intra-Community trade, then we will face a situation in which all ports, including all yachting harbours, are classified as European ports. In that case the greatest danger would be a scattergun approach, not concentrating resources. This is also recognised in our regional policy, which Commissioner Barnier has referred to. We must point the way, but we can only do that if we support key projects in a truly consistent way instead of adopting a scattergun approach and subsidising all and sundry. My second point is about the competitive situation not only between ports, but also within a single port. So if we were all allowed to provide state aid for buildings, van carriers and so on, there would be unacceptable competition between private and state companies operating at the same port, and also between different ports. That is why we need a clear pan-European policy on ports which really does respect competition.

 Mr President, current petrol and diesel prices strike at the very heart of transport companies and threaten their existence. Such prices are unacceptable. I believe we must temporarily reduce the various tax burdens to an economically and socially sustainable level. Bear in mind that we are not the ones that set the tax rates. As a European Union, we have set minimum rates of taxation for motor vehicle and mineral oil. It is the Member States that have the room for manoeuvre. They have pushed it to the limit, and now we are facing this crisis of high oil prices, they must drop these prices and coordinate them. We cannot have a situation where, rightly or wrongly, one government caves in but another does not, and where companies in one country have distortions in competition to contend with that companies from another country do not. They get the same prices in the same market but their costs are different. This is an intolerable state of affairs for the transport sector. Madam Vice-President, I would suggest that you go to Luxembourg and tell the Transport Ministers, firstly that we need concerted action, and secondly, that we need to see a reduction in costs for the transport sector. Thirdly, we do not want the Transport Ministers to make empty promises that will be scotched by the Finance Ministers in two weeks’ time. The decisions reached by the 15 Member States this evening, or in the course of the next few days, must be upheld. They must translate into action. Some Ministers bemoan the fate of the transport sector, whilst others refuse to reduce or amend taxes. Such two-faced behaviour is unsupportable! (Applause from the right)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE-DE Group is very pleased with the end result – one reservation aside – because the new directive will ultimately enable us to make progress in marine protection, and in establishing a level playing field for the Union’s ports. The significance of the directive resides first and foremost in the fact that all Member States will be obliged to ensure that port reception facilities are set up, within the next two years, in all ports subject to this requirement. Captains will also be obliged to use these facilities. We hope that the rationale behind these two commitments will lead to a reduction in the amount of ship-generated waste deposited illegally in the sea, thus strengthening the marine environment and also improving competition between ports. I believe that the conciliation procedure was successful in the end, for we did at least manage to secure our demand for ships to have to pay a significant contribution towards the costs of the facilities, irrespective of how much they make use of them. Parliament would rather have succeeded with its demand for ‘significant’ to represent at least 90%, as this would have satisfied us, and there would no longer be any financial interest whatsoever in simply dumping waste at sea. After all, if ships had to pay anyway, then they might as well use the facilities. Sadly, the Council could not bring itself to accept this logical, no special fee provision, hence our reservation against the directive. And we hope that if it becomes apparent that ships are continuing to discharge waste into the sea, the Commission will propose an amendment at the revision stage in three years’ time. Having said that, Madam Vice-President, we are grateful to you for the fact that your statement – which is, after all, of crucial importance – does at least, in effect, secure a bottom line of 30% as the amount agreed by the Council and Parliament, and we are relying on the Council to act on your statement accordingly. Secondly, as my honourable friend has already said, we have scored two other victories for marine protection and the citizens of the European Union. Firstly, we have stipulated that 25% of all commercial shipping will in fact be obliged to undergo inspection, in order to ensure that waste disposal is being carried out in accordance with the regulations. MARPOL is all well and good but not when it stays on the bookshelf! We will only be able to protect the sea if we actually monitor whether waste disposal has taken place. Secondly, we have put pressure on the Member States to meet their obligation to actually set up these port reception facilities. We have ensured that Member States will be required to introduce compensation measures, in case ships are forced to remain in ports unnecessarily, simply because there are no waste disposal facilities available, or they are inadequate. In this way, although the ships will have to pay, they will also be protected. Mr President, on a final note, I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank the committee chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, and the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for their committed and successful handling of these negotiations.

 Mr President, where air traffic too is concerned, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats supports the initiative of the European Commission and of the responsible Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, to reconcile causing as little damage as possible to the environment with citizens’ and companies’ interest in being able to travel. The Committee too has made a decision along the same lines, although we ought in all honesty to say that we had completely to re-write Mrs Lucas’ report, since it was based upon totally unrealistic premisses. However, we finally reached a majority agreement. The summer has again shown how important air travel is for people heading for their holiday destinations. Particularly where families with children are concerned, air travel offers the quickest means of getting away to the sun, and the one which puts least strain on the nerves. At the same time, it provides the basis for jobs and businesses in many parts of the European Union. Business travel and freight forwarding on international air routes are also vital to trade and commerce. On the other hand, air travel has an obvious detrimental effect upon the environment due to exhaust emissions and noise pollution. We must make sure that we limit these forms of damage to the environment, at the same time, however, as distinguishing between the damage caused to health around airports and the ways in which people’s ordinary well-being is prejudiced. I fear that, if we were to adopt the WHO’s regulations, none of us here this evening would be allowed to go on working, since more than ten hours spent in this Chamber is scarcely compatible with these regulations. So let us be realistic, please. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats in any case calls for a significant reduction in permitted levels of noise pollution – which, in view of the international character of air travel, ought more sensibly to be regulated within the framework of the ICAO – and for noisier aircraft to be excluded from using European airports following brief transitionary periods. We hope, and are campaigning for, a situation in which the Member States of the European Commission will provide a clear mandate. If, however, we were not to obtain success at ICAO level, then we should have to take action ourselves, for Europe is densely populated and we do not have the luxury of the large distances between population centres that are to be found in America or Africa. We have to protect our citizens from unnecessary noise. (Applause)

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to give very warm thanks to my colleague Robert Atkins for drafting such an excellent report. He took great trouble not just to comment on the Commission’s proposals but also to outline them. I regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one. Indeed in paragraphs 4 and 5 we note again that our Parliament has now decided on two occasions that the regulatory function is to be transferred to the European Union. That brings me back to the last speaker. Of course we have to distinguish between possibly having several or many service providers in the operational field, but the regulatory function must remain with, or more to the point go to the European Union. Nor is that in any way a problem. Today we have 15 Member States in the European Union, and 12 more have applied to join. If we start to proceed according to the EEA system even at this point – defining the common rules and then asking the candidate states their opinion – we can integrate them. That is why I also think it is a good idea in the present situation for the European Commission to pool Member States’ interests in regard to the regulatory function in the framework of Eurocontrol. We do not need multilingualism, we need unanimity on the question of the regulatory function. I really would strongly urge the Commissioner to refer the proposals Parliament will be deciding on today back to the High Level Group and to continue ensuring that this working group produces very sound practical results. We have great respect for the vice-president, for she set up this group of military and civilian experts and the work is progressing well. There may still be some resistance in individual countries. We wish the vice-president much luck and success, so that come October we can submit an excellent programme.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism proposes that plenary at last gradually but properly liberalise the railway market, with liberalisation to be completed by the year 2010. Only then will we achieve our common goal of shifting more freight from the roads on to the railways and, hence, of sustainable mobility within the European Union. First I must thank the Commission, especially the Vice-President, Mrs Palacio, and the Finnish Presidency, without whom there would have been no common positions in the Council in December 1999. We are most grateful for that. But Parliament will defend the view in the codecision procedure that the positions taken do not go far enough in order to safeguard the long-term future of the railways. The Council wants to move one small step at a time. We take the view that it is high time, eight years after the completion of the single market, to set signals and regulate conclusively so that the liberalisation of the railway sector can be completed by 2010. This also fits in with what was said at the Lisbon Summit, where the Heads of State and Government pressed for further liberalisation of the transport sector. So what are our most important proposed amendments? First, we agree with the Council that, if the railway networks are to be used efficiently, only cross-border freight traffic need be liberalised for a special trans-European rail freight network. But we take the view that five years is long enough to show railways and their employees that they have nothing to fear from the liberalisation of the networks. We feel that railway undertakings should have access to the entire network of the fifteen Member States in five years' time, for both international and national freight traffic, and by 2010 for international and national passenger traffic. This gradual liberalisation plan would give us a real common network in the European Union by 2010. In order to ensure that railway undertakings in all Member States also have real access to local networks in other Member States, we feel that there must be a strict, compulsory division between the management of individual networks and the provision of transport services by individual national railway undertakings. Experience over the past 40 years shows that, if infrastructure and operations are not separated, the national railway undertaking always reserves the best lines for itself, thereby denying other railway undertakings effective, non-discriminatory access. We take the view that, if there is to be even greater use of the networks, legal entities other than railway undertakings, such as shippers and forwarding agents, should have the right to apply for and be granted licences to use lines throughout the Community. Liberalising the right to apply to use lines in all fifteen Member States by 2005 will do two things: first, it will take account of the role of shippers and forwarding agents, who need no encouragement to use the railways and, secondly, it will represent a further step towards the completion of the single market in the railway sector in that the railways' exclusive right to use the infrastructure will be somewhat mitigated. Another factor is the question of track charges. We take the view that track charges should be increased in the medium and long term in order to move towards the objective of covering costs. Only if the user pays, i.e. the railway undertakings also bear the cost of operating and maintaining the network, will it be possible to fund network operation and maintenance. Finally, the Committee on Transport voted by a large majority to abolish the derogations for Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Great Britain with respect to Northern Ireland. We feel that, first, legislation should be the same in all parts of the Union and, secondly, even in geographically remote areas, which we of course all value, the principles of accuracy and clarity of costs and open access to the network should apply. Allow me to close by stressing once again that we can use our vote in Parliament tomorrow to give a signal. If we adopt the recommendation by the Committee on Transport by a large majority, we will have a real chance of reaching a compromise with the Council during the conciliation procedure which is acceptable to both the Council and Parliament, which goes beyond the common positions and which enables a real move to be made towards liberalising the railway sector, because we all want to strengthen the railways. We want to shift more freight from the roads to the railways, which is why we need a clear compromise with the Council. And we shall only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in Parliament.

A very good evening Mr President, Commissioner. It is unusual, but you know that I have the highest personal regard for you and am therefore delighted to see you here this evening. Interoperability is a fundamental issue and, if we take it seriously, the time has come to admit that the European Union has failed over recent years. We have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability. I think it is extremely important that we again inform the Council, where everything is diligently recorded, that 40 years after the creation of the European common market, we have made no progress in the railway sector. I hope that the draft report by Mr Savary, whom I should like once again to thank for his draft, and I should also like to thank my colleague Mrs Jeggle for her shadow report – I hope that if we manage to persuade the Commission and Council to accept the draft report, we shall be reasonably well placed for the future. I also hope that the Council will accept our proposed amendments. We have taken a great deal of trouble and Mr Savary has also tabled umpteen proposed amendments for the plenary sitting, which we support, in order to achieve a report which the Council can accept, thereby avoiding a conciliation procedure and second reading. I hope that the Council will do so and I call on it to act responsibly. Having made no progress whatsoever with interoperability for years now, the Council should accept our decision tomorrow so that we can make some progress and avoid yet another second reading and conciliation procedure. The difficulty which must be acknowledged is, of course, that the internal market can only function if we have uniform systems in the long term and we must ensure that we really do make progress here. I also call on industry in Europe to abandon the policy it has pursued over recent years of separating off its national market by deliberately not manufacturing rolling stock which can be used in other countries. Everyone has staked out their own market, which is why we have this fragmented railway market in Europe – and this is unacceptable. Allow me one more closing comment. Mr Swoboda, who is about to speak, and I shall soon be discussing the Railway Pact here in the House. We are opening the markets but we need interoperability in order to do so. These are two aspects of the overall complex and I therefore hope that the Council really is wise and clever enough to accept the proposed amendments which we shall probably adopt by a large majority tomorrow.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, new members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is a solemn occasion, but it is also the day on which our work begins. On Monday, we welcomed new Members to our House, and we would have liked you, Mr President of the Commission, to have been here in Strasbourg to share our joy. You are here today, though, and we are glad that you have come to join us, along with the new and current members of the Commission. We have always regarded the Commission as a sort of government. Romano Prodi took up office as its President five years ago; some of the Member States’ governments have been fiercely critical of him, but we have always supported him, for the members of the Commission are of course politicians, albeit not tied to political parties. I wish the new Commissioners good luck and success in their work, and would like to assure them that our group will give them every conceivable support. We welcome Péter Balázs, Joe Borg, Ján Figel', Dalia Grybauskaitė Danuta Hübner, Siim Kallas, Sandra Kalniete, Markos Kyprianou, Janez Potočnik and Pavel Telička. From the Member States that belonged to the European Union even before 1 May, we give an equally warm welcome to Jacques Barrot and Joaquín Almunia, as well, of course, to Commissioner Dimas, with whom this plenary has already had dealings. I see it as very important that we should get back to a consensus on what the European Commission’s role is. I know that this is a particular topic of discussion in those countries that have now joined the European Union, and I regard the talk in some of them about how the Commissioners from the new Member States are too European, as utterly mistaken. To those among the new Commissioners who face such reproaches at home, I would like to say that we are right alongside you if you are putting the well-being of the European Union first, for that is the role you have to perform under the constitution, so to speak. You represent the European Union as a whole, and in your work Europe’s interest must come first; you can always rely on the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. If you have opposition to contend with in your own countries, we will be there to defend you! I hope you will not mind my saying, by way of a recommendation, that you do of course have an important role in relation to your own countries, one that you share with the Members of this House, as, so to speak, communicators of the European ideal to the states from which we come. So I hope that the members of the Commission from the new Member States will, together with Members of the European Parliament, be successful in explaining to their countries the need for European policies and in getting the message across that those who consider only their national interests are actually damaging them. Only if you ally your own nation’s interests to those of Europe as a whole will you be able to advance its cause; there will be no allies in Europe for those who are blind to all but their own country, and so they will be unable to do anything for it. That is why interests have to be represented at local, regional, national and European level simultaneously, and I wish the new members of the Commission much success as they go about doing that. A few moments ago, I described the members of the Commission as politicians but not party politicians. Mr President of the Commission, I cannot spare you the serious request that you devote the remaining months of your Presidency to continuing to preside over the Commission in a truly effective manner and to concentrate on your work there rather than on domestic political disputes in Italy, your own country. The European Union Summit is to be held on 17-18 June, and so, Mr President, it might well be advisable for us to hold another Conference of Presidents on the afternoon of Thursday 17 June and discuss how to organise the proceedings as a whole. I say this as a suggestion, so that we can, together, give some thought to that. Let me say, by way of conclusion, that the Commission and the European Parliament are allies. With this in mind, our group will be alongside the new Commission, ensuring that we succeed in the joint enterprise of shaping this European Union, with the Commission playing a decisive role, possessing as it does the power of initiative. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supportive, and what we want to see from the Commission is close cooperation. If we get it, then we will, together, do great things for our European Union. With that in mind, I wish the new members of the Commission every success. We are right behind you. (Applause)

 Mr President, it is a fine tradition for the chairmen of the groups to sincerely thank the outgoing Presidents and so I, like the other group chairmen, have asked to take the floor. For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is in no way an obligatory exercise but rather a wholehearted and warm word of thanks, one that is sincerely meant. Mr President, Pat Cox, you are a person who combines vision and pragmatism and you are person who is full of political and personal fairness. You combine the best traditions of your country, the Republic of Ireland, with our European conviction. You will always be numbered among the great Presidents of the European Parliament and you were lucky that your Presidency fell in a successful time, at a time when the constitution was being debated and when ten new Member States joined the European Union. You mentioned the one task that remains unfinished: the Statute for Members. Immediately after a new Parliament is elected, it will be our duty, the duty of those who are re-elected, to put into effect your work to complete the Statute. Mr President, you can take pride in the dignity with which you held office and carried out your duties. We all have reason to sincerely thank you and I am also doing so at a personal level. I wish you all the very best for your personal future and for everything that you will do in your country. On behalf of our group, I sincerely wish you all the very best. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Vitorino, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hume has just spoken very movingly. Having been a Member of this House since 1979, he will be leaving Parliament, as will my Irish friend Mr McCartin. At a time like now, when we are thinking about the future, that should prompt us to briefly review the past, as we have just done in commemorating Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli. Looking back over the past in this way enables us to have confidence and hope that we really can be optimistic in looking forward to our continent’s future. Let us consider the previous enlargements. There was one in 1973, when the Europe of the Six was joined by Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom, thus becoming a Europe of Nine; then, in 1981, came Greece; Spain and Portugal joined in 1986, with three more countries –Finland, Sweden and Austria – acceding in 1995. Finally, we now have a Community of 25. Hand in hand with this, the Community has always gained in depth, with the EEC and Euratom being created in 1957, the Single European Act in 1986, and the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, in connection with which we must recall the great achievements of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President François Mitterrand and Commission President Jacques Delors, whose work was successfully continued by Jacques Santer. We then had Amsterdam in 1995, followed by Nice, which may well not have been that much of a success, but it was there that we adopted the resolution that we would conclude accession negotiations with the candidate countries in time for the European elections. If we were to sum up all the changes that have taken place over these years, we would have to come to the conclusion that this is a great continent, one that has always, even when faced with great difficulties, gone forward in the right direction. It is now a matter of our great good fortune that Ireland holds the Presidency – Mr Roche, their Minister for Europe and our President-in-Office of the Council, is with us today – and is conducting its affairs with a combination of vision, pragmatism and goodwill, the latter quite crucial if there is to be any progress. Let me thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for the work you have done to date. If we deserve a European Constitution, it is because of your efforts and Europe’s. I would also like to express gratitude to Commissioner Vitorino, who, jointly with his fellow-Commissioner Mr Barnier presided over the work done by our colleagues in the Convention. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would welcome it if the Irish presidency were yet to succeed in getting a reference made in the preamble to our Judaeo-Christian heritage. It is because this embodies our values that we regard it as important, but it is also important that you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, should not agree to any curtailment of Parliament’s budgetary prerogatives. Commissioner Vitorino also made reference to that. Such a thing must not be permitted. It is one of the prerogatives of the European Parliament, and indeed of any other, to be able to determine what is done with the Budget, and we will not be able accept any curtailment of our rights in that respect. The European Constitution is a great step forward, in that it strengthens Europe as a Community. It represents progress in that it strengthens European democracy and parliamentary government. The European Constitution is a step forward in that subsidiarity is reinforced, and in that it makes reference, for the first time, to local governance. Municipalities, cities, communities, that is to say the places we call home, are given the right to manage their own affairs. The national parliaments are also given the right to appeal in the event of their rights under the subsidiarity principle being infringed. Europe is becoming more efficient, Europe is becoming more democratic, and what we want to achieve is unity for this Europe of ours in all its diversity. The Constitution is a means to that end. When considering the future, we have to answer the question as to who can yet become a member of the European Union. With whom do we want to co-exist as good neighbours? We want to co-exist as good neighbours with everyone, especially with our Arab and Muslim neighbours, so that our continent may be a continent of peace, founded upon law and with a constitution of its own. We wish the Irish Presidency every success in achieving that for us. (Applause)

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President de Palacio, Commissioner Verheugen, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to start by saying something personal. It is my privilege to have been a Member of this House ever since 1979, when it was, for the first time, directly elected. If, during the 1979 election campaign, somebody had said that, on 1 May 2004, the European Union’s Member States would include three nations occupied by the Soviet Union – those being Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Warsaw Pact states of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, part of Communist Yugoslavia, not to mention Malta and Cyprus – the latter of which will, we hope, one not too distant day be a united country – then, in 1979, when the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our answer would probably have been that this was a lovely vision, a wonderful dream, and a great hope, but that we feared that this dream, this vision, this hope – much though we desired it – would not become reality in our lifetime. That dream has become reality. The fact that we are able, today, to welcome 162 Members of this Parliament from these 10 countries makes this a great day for democracy, and a great deal for parliamentarianism. Let us rejoice that we can welcome as colleagues our new Members today! (Applause)
 Let us not forget that it was our House, with every political group playing its part, that insisted that we would be negotiating not merely with five countries but with 12, and that those who were not yet ready would be given the opportunity to catch up. The fact that ten countries have joined the European Union today is attributable to our demand, in this House, that the negotiations should include Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and they have made it. We should congratulate them all. (Applause)
 Let us not forget that, as we know, the reports on the European Parliament in the media do not always reflect the decisions taken in it. It was our House that demanded a timetable for the negotiations – which the Commission and the Nice Summit accepted – so that they could be completed in time, enabling the countries capable of doing so, and their people, to take part in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament. It was our House that did that! That is what we should be telling people, and it is something of which we can be proud, for it helps to make democracy real in Europe and to give the people of the ten countries the opportunity to send freely-elected representatives to the European Parliament. Let us rejoice in that! (Applause)
 Everyday life will soon catch up with us, and, necessary though great speeches are, it is not by them that Europe is maintained. Today is a wonderful day, as 1 May was, but everyday life will soon overtake us; we will discuss things, we will argue about things too, but we, the people of the European Union, must remind ourselves of what is new and represents a great opportunity; that the great thing about this European Union is that our discussions and arguments are now carried on with words, no longer by force and weaponry. That is a great step forward for our continent of Europe in the twenty-first century. (Applause)
 My dear friends … perhaps my addressing you as ‘dear friends’ was a slip of the tongue, and I apologise, but we do somehow belong to one another through our shared ideal of European unity. At the impressive ceremony outdoors, Mr President, we heard not only from you, with your impressive speech, but from Lech Walesa. He embodies solidarity, and solidarity must mean for all of us a future in which we of course have to respect the national interests of individual countries, such as those of the Baltic States with their minorities, whilst not jeopardising those countries’ independence, an obligation that is reciprocal. Anything else, therefore, we have to speak out against, as Commissioner Verheugen has done, and I would like to thank him for making the important point that this Europe of ours in founded upon solidarity. That will benefit all of us. For the first time in its long millennia of history, this continent has the opportunity to face the future in peace and partnership. This is our continent, an ancient continent endlessly renewing itself, and nobody will succeed in dividing us. Side by side, we walk into the future together; this is a great day for us all! (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two things I want to say. We spent a great deal of time yesterday considering the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, which has been a matter of some controversy. I would like to say that we regard the refusal by the President of Parliament to permit the amendments as lacking any legal justification and we are therefore contesting his decision. We will also be considering legal action to test whether the rights of Members of this House can be set aside by sweeping aside all the amendments, as was done in this instance. It is because we regard this as a very serious course of action that our group will not be taking part in today’s vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, thereby recording our protest and our inability to accept this decision. There is a second matter that I would like to address, and it has to do with what Mr Barón Crespo said in the plenary yesterday. The first question that has to be dealt with has to do with the background to Mr Barón Crespo’s assertion that documents had disappeared from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for, if that is indeed the case, then it follows that it could affect all the procedural issues connected with the Boogerd-Quaak report. I would, however, ask Mr Barón Crespo to withdraw the allegations he made in the plenary yesterday, which are, unfortunately, not recorded in the Minutes. Yesterday, I heard the remarks that Mr Barón Crespo addressed to Mr Tajani, and they are recorded on the House’s official tapes, but not in the Minutes. Yesterday, Mr Barón Crespo said to Mr Tajani, for whom we all have high regard: ‘Calla, desgraciado’
, which, when translated, means ‘shut up, you wretch!’ I think it unworthy for one Member of this House to describe another in these terms, and I ask Mr Barón Crespo to withdraw this remark. Something else was said, and I regret that. I had never thought I would have to say something like this in this House. There is, though, something that binds us together no matter what disputes we may have with each other, and that is our mutual respect. That is something that our group, at any rate, stands for, and such language should not be used to anyone. I will add that Mr Barón Crespo also said something that I will read out, which was taken down for me from the tape. I am reading it in Spanish, a language that I, unfortunately, do not speak, and so I apologise if I am not getting it quite right: ‘pediría a los jabalíes que andan sueltos por ahí que tengan tranquilidad.
’ Translated, that means: ‘I would ask the wild boar running loose in this Chamber to calm themselves!’ Such, ladies and gentlemen, is not the language that should be used here in the European Parliament, and I ask Mr Barón Crespo to put right the remarks he made yesterday. (Applause)

 In fact, I had not intended to rise, but I must respond to what Mr Watson, the Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, has just said. He urges our group to withdraw its amendments. Let me point out to Mr Watson that there are 338 amendments, 157 of which have been tabled by our group. That means that 181 come from other groups. It is unfair to imply that our group is solely responsible for all the amendments. A great many Members are unsatisfied with this report, and that is why 181 amendments have been tabled by other groups. I would urge you, Mr President, to ensure that speakers do not only refer to amendments from our group.

 Mr President, I have every sympathy for Mr Barón Crespo, but I am not clear about his conclusion. You asked a question and Mr Barón Crespo provided an explanation, but he failed to arrive at any conclusion. That is why I have risen in order to say that I will gladly endorse your proposal to hold the vote tomorrow. We are in a difficult situation with 338 amendments which are multiplying as a result of procedural issues. I think it is important, ladies and gentlemen, to underline this point, and I make it calmly and objectively. We have already discussed this issue this morning when the sitting opened at 9 a.m. The Chairman of one of the groups claimed that the amendments come from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I would like to point out that there are 338 amendments, and that not all of these amendments come from our group. We have tabled 157, which means that 181 amendments come from other people. I would ask for this fact to be noted. I shall refrain from commenting on the quality of the report at this point as I do not wish to exacerbate the situation, but I would ask everyone to work together to achieve some kind of resolution to this difficult issue. Mr President, we know you to be a fair and objective President of this House, and if you propose that we vote on the report tomorrow at 12 noon in accordance with the procedure that you suggest, you have our support.

 Mr President, I am very surprised about the statement by Mr Barón Crespo, for whom I otherwise have the highest regard, in which he mentions our group in the same breath as the no-confidence motion against the Commission. I would like here to state that I am severely critical of the fact that Commission President Romano Prodi is obviously too involved in Italian domestic politics to bother with his tasks as President of the Commission. (Applause)
 This is still no reason, however, for us now to consider a vote of no confidence, precisely because we have such excellent members of the Commission as the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, who is here today. (Applause)
 So our group has absolutely nothing to do with the no-confidence motion, Mr Barón Crespo. I really ask that you forget about the elections for a bit (Laughter)
 and not look for arguments that are simply not there. That is the first point. Secondly, Mr Barón Crespo – and I would like once again to express my high regard for him – has said that we should not deliberate or vote on Eurostat and a dismissal. The Parliament decided to do so yesterday. Mr Barón Crespo, we jointly have that right, that is the basis of our work, of the European Union, and for that reason I recommend that we proceed in the way that we decided to yesterday. (Applause)

 Mr President, we have, over many weeks and months, been devoting our attention to Eurostat, and you will be well aware that a substantial number of us here in this House even wanted to go as far as to state that it had no confidence in the Commission. Although I have always been opposed to a vote of no confidence in the Commission, this House does have a legitimate interest in hearing what the Commission has to say on the subject and how it assesses what went on at Eurostat. Our listening to the Commission’s statement, and our discussion of it, is a sign of fairness, openness and transparency.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels Summit had as its focus and main subject the terrible events of March 11, 2004 in Madrid, and it was good that it drew from them the necessary conclusions. As one who can still well remember how the US President John F. Kennedy in 1963 said in a divided Berlin: ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’, I think that, as Europeans, we must adopt a similar attitude towards our Spanish partners and friends. We must say that this attack in Madrid was not only an attack on Spain, but an attack on Europe as a whole, on the entire Western world, the entire world. So it is in sympathy and solidarity with Spain that we must commit ourselves to action and to clear and decisive promotion of the European Union and the unity of Europe. This must be our answer to terrorism. I would like to thank you at this point very much, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for your leadership, which has made it possible for this signal to be sent out from Brussels. Europe is now to act! Europe wants to be united, and Europe wants to find its way to the future together! It is right that the summit has accepted the solidarity clause in the version of the Constitution. This is a solidarity clause against terrorism. However, Europe must show solidarity in general, when faced with external attacks, and, now more than ever, we know that domestic and foreign policy form an integrated whole and that the one cannot be separated from the other. We also welcome the appointment of a coordinator for matters of internal security, and, in Mr Gijs de Vries, a former Member of this House, we have found an excellent candidate for this position. I look forward to collaborating with the Coordinator for Internal Security! Let me also say, however, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – and this intervention will certainly not be the last word – that we would have welcomed it if the office of the security coordinator had been established not in the area of foreign policy and intergovernmental collaboration but, as the Commission wanted, in the area of the Community institutions, so that it would also be subject to Parliamentary and legal control. I think this is important for the future, and, whilst I would not wish to put a question mark against the creation of this position, it will also be necessary for us not to treat it simply as an alibi in order to be able to say that we have done enough in this area. What is now needed is a very specific policy for us to implement in internal security. For this reason, I very much regret that the European arrest warrant is not yet in place, and we urge the five Member States who have not yet ratified to do so. We must also build up Europol, which would be much more effective if these difficult financial negotiations did not have to be conducted between the Member States of the European Union whenever we want to give it money. Why do we not make Europol, too, subject to the Community method, so that it can be financed from the Community budget? That would make everything much easier. I also think we should accept the Community method in this area, too. I believe that the most important thing, in discussions of internal security and terrorism, is that we should tell the Arab world that we do not identify terrorism with them or with Islam. Let me say this now – permit me to say this as a German – I remember the discussions after 1945, when there was talk of the collective guilt of the Germans. That was rejected, and rightly, because not everybody was responsible for the crimes of National Socialism. In just the same way, we should not today make the mistake of equating terrorism with the Arab and Islamic world as a whole. We want cooperation; we want collaboration with the Arab and Islamic world. For this reason too, I emphatically agree with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who has said – as you also have done, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – that peace in the Middle East with security and dignity for all people in Israel and Palestine is absolutely crucial in terms of peace in the world and peaceful relations between Europe and the Middle East and the Arab world as a whole. We must counter contempt for humanity with the dignity of man, asserting our principles of life against their principles of death, and, in place of hatred, our desire for collaboration. The message must now be – and I must thank you warmly for it – that we are gaining a Constitution, of which our group is very decidedly in favour, and the entire European People’s Party has declared it to be the topmost priority. We would like to say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that it would be a magnificent achievement if, under your presidency – we would like to see it before the European elections – you were to be able to bring the Constitution to a successful conclusion. We wish you every success. We support you. The right answer to give the world is that Europe is determined and united. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin with a few words to the President-in-Office on behalf of my group to express our sincere appreciation and admiration of the way in which the Irish Government is conducting its presidency of the Council. It is working with goodwill, a strong sense of purpose, discretion and efficiency. I believe this is a good example of the way in which even our less populous countries can achieve major political progress. Mr President-in-Office, I emphatically welcome your statement that, if it were a matter for the Irish presidency, you would bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion during your tenure. This confirms our impression that your presidency is giving of its best. Let me say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that we warmly welcome the fact that things have started to move and that this movement extends to unresolved issues, particularly that of the double majority. For my own part, I have always urged the Government of Germany to be flexible and move forward. Since this is now happening, I must clearly acknowledge it. But these efforts by the German Government must be accompanied by similar efforts on the part of other governments. This is not the time or place to be apportioning blame for mistakes or for obstructive rigidity; the time has come for all governments to make compromises, and we call on them to do so. The stakes are high; the President of the Council spoke of dangers – that is how his words were translated into my language – and so it is important that we remind ourselves again of what we seek to achieve through this constitution. Our European values are described in the preamble, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The functions and responsibilities of the European Parliament are described in the draft constitution. Its provisions represent a huge leap forward for the European Parliament, democracy and parliamentarianism in Europe. The legislative activity of the Council of Ministers is to become more transparent, even though we will not get the legislative council we have asked for. Under the Convention’s proposals, the Commission will be appointed in such a way, with the President of the Commission being proposed by the Heads of State or Government, that its composition will reflect the results of the European elections. This is truly great progress, because it would enable the people of the European Union to influence the nature of the Commission through the ballot box. While we are well aware that this is not yet applicable law, we advocate the introduction of such an arrangement in time for this year’s European elections. This would mean that, in proposing a President of the Commission, the Heads of State or Government would take account of the result of the European elections. This accords with democratic principles; it is a fair solution; it is not motivated by party-political considerations but is a matter of principle. Mr President-in-Office, when the nomination of a President of the Commission is discussed under your presidency, we urge you to take the outcome of the European elections into account in your deliberations. We do need to call to mind the strenuous efforts that were made before the Convention’s proposal materialised. I should like to reiterate my thanks to the two representatives of Parliament, Klaus Hänsch and Elmar Brok, for their great work and, of course, to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing for his chairmanship of the Convention as well as to all those from our Parliament and from the national parliaments and governments who contributed to the final draft. This whole effort must not be allowed to end in failure now. I remember very well how the President of the French Republic, as President of the European Council, explained the Treaty of Nice to us in December 2000 and how, in his response to our criticism of the outcome of the Nice Summit, he made a declaration of intent. The first step towards the creation of the Convention on the Future of Europe was taken when the French President agreed that there was a need to think about introducing a new method of reforming the EU, and the next was the Laeken decision and the work with which we are all familiar. That work must not be in vain. From the first of May, we shall be a Community of 455 million people. We need clear and sound legal foundations for the European Union of the future, so that this whole structure can be held together. At the heart of the constitution are the means by which we can agree on common methods and peacefully resolve conflicts of interest and disputes. In short, the constitution is all about a peaceful future for our continent, and it is a project that must not be allowed to fail. Mr President-in-Office, I wish you every success and hope that you will harvest the fruits of these efforts before the end of your presidency. (Applause)

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of his concern that people in today’s European Union countries are not well enough informed. I share that concern, but I would like to ask what the alternative would be. The alternative – and we must tell people that – would be continuing lack of freedom, the continuation of a totalitarian regime. That is why we should be glad and grateful that the nations of Central Europe – and of course Cyprus and Malta – are joining our union of values under different circumstances, on the basis of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the market economy. We wish the nations of Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus a warm welcome. It is an occasion for joy. Our group and the entire Parliament have always supported it. We will be having the first free elections in Europe. In the accession countries, our political friends and the people there refer to these European elections as Europe’s first free elections. That is why we must reject the call, from the prime minister of one of the accession countries, for there to be a single list. No, ladies and gentlemen; elections are a political competition and we should be glad that such competition is now possible in the countries of Central Europe, too. (Applause)
 The enlargement of the European Union is, however, not just a material question. In essence, it is a question of values, a spiritual question. We should also be saying to our new partners in Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus: do not ask what you can get out of the European Union, but let us all in the present and future European Union ask ourselves what we can do for Europe together to make this Europe strong, to make this Europe democratic and to make this Europe carry weight in the world. I have great admiration for what the accession countries have already achieved. After more than 50 years of communism, these nations have had to make a tremendous effort. There is still a lot to be done, however. Commissioner Verheugen, Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs have already drawn our attention to that. I believe we will do it, however. We should put across to the people of the European Union that our experience with enlargement when Spain and Portugal joined shows that in the end everyone will gain, materially and economically too. Tremendous challenges remain in the area of internal security. I have just been talking to an expert on internal security from Europol. Of course we must secure the external borders. But that expert explained to me that the drugs mafia, which is already making trouble in the European Union, will also expand its activities to the accession countries. That means we must strengthen Europol and police cooperation as a whole. One final remark. Commissioner, you and this Commission still have to give an assessment of Turkey. Opinions in our Group differ over whether Turkey should become a member or not. I will not go into that now. However, we expect the Commission, we expect you, to make your assessment on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria and not to make a politically opportunistic recommendation, but to comply with the law. The Commission is bound to do so as guardian of the Treaties, and we will judge you by that yardstick. We will meet and discuss this matter again. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Secretary-General Annan, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr High Representative, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is a significant day in the history of the European Parliament, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, extends a very warm welcome to you, Mr Annan. When, in the Conference of Presidents and in this House, we voted that you should receive the Sakharov Prize for 2003, we did so gladly and not merely as a matter of political judgment. Now, as we offer you our heartfelt gratitude, we remember Sérgio Vieira de Mello and the many who were killed by a murderous terrorist act in Baghdad, we remember the many who have laid down their lives in the service of the United Nations, and, to those members of their families who are here today, we extend our sympathy and express our solidarity. Those who work for the United Nations dedicate themselves to human rights and democracy, and so it is only right that the Sakharov Prize should be awarded to the United Nations. Today, we remember Andrei Sakharov, whose great intellectual and moral strength can be felt to this day by those who visit his simple grave in the Novodevichy cemetery outside Moscow, and our desire is that the Russian people may follow his example; that, in Russia and around the world, people may bring to life the ideals of Andrei Sakharov, that great physicist, philosopher and campaigner for human rights. Today, our thoughts are also with his widow, Yelena Bonner, who shared decades of exile with him and to whom our group awarded the Schuman Medal, and today we greet her in her simple and modest home in Moscow’s Ulitsa Skalova. We would have been glad of the presence of the Sakharov Prize laureates Leyla Zana und Oswaldo José Paya Sardiñas, who, along with others, are unable to be with us today. (Applause)
 Andrei Sakharov once said that the most important voice is the one that cannot be heard, and my hope for the people of Cuba is that they may be enabled to speak clearly. Although, Mr Secretary-General, there is much that could be said about immigration, which involves integration, we share the same values of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, so, all things considered, we are taking the same road, and I hope that you will, as Secretary-General, see the day when the European Union, with a seat of its own, can defend these values in the Security Council and in the United Nations. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if Mr Hänsch is listening, let me say that, although Brussels is a cold place at the moment, those of us who are motivated by the Christian faith are in any case always animated by hope and optimism, and that is why nobody can hamper our work on a European constitution; we too want the sun to shine. (Interjection by Mr Schulz: And it is deepest red!)
  That it may well be for you lot; red is a fine colour, but not only by its associations with the European Socialists ... (Applause, laughter)
 ... that is a misuse of the colour. Let us be serious; let us get back to 2004, which is, as we all know, a crucial year. On 1 May, ten countries will be acceding to the European Union, in which there will then be 450 million people – far more than in the USA and Russia combined, and that figure itself shows by its magnitude how necessary it is that we should have a basis on which these 25 States – and later more – with their 450 million inhabitants may be held together. It is important that we should be able, on 10 and 13 June, to present the voters with a constitution that will show us the way to get through this twenty-first century in peaceful cooperation, as our continent is peacefully integrated. Let me say, on behalf of the European People’s Party element in our shared group, that we see the constitution as the priority above all others. It was the experience of Nice that prompted us to set up the Convention. It was Parliament – I do not want to claim credit solely for our own group – that called for the Convention. I can tell you that if the Convention had been able to take decisions on its own, we would have a constitution today. What was proposed was, in principle, a right and proper project, and that is why we declare that the failure of the Brussels Summit must not mean the failure of the European Constitution and that everyone concerned should now learn from the Brussels experience. Apportioning blame will get us nowhere, and not only politics but also human experience teach us that blame is never, or almost never, to be attached to one person alone, but that it is always shared by many. We therefore urge everyone to seek out opportunities for compromise and to muster their capacity for it, for there is above all a psychological basis for success, namely that we should respect each other and that the small countries should be treated with the same respect as the large ones. A country may well be large, but that does not mean that it is on the right track. (Applause)
 There are, then, no first and second-class Members of the European Union. One does hear some preposterous arguments used against the constitution; there are those who say that a constitution amounts to centralism and a European superstate, and the very same people who reject a constitution scorn Europe as being, in their eyes, nothing more than a bureaucracy. That is why we say that a constitution is our chosen means of making democracy and parliamentarianism realities in the European Union. (Applause)
 (Interruption by Mr Schulz: Name names!)
 Indeed, Mr Schulz, there are many that I have in mind, but I do not want to make you more famous than you already are. The constitution will strengthen not only this House, but also the national parliaments, which will be able to appeal, on the grounds of subsidiarity, even against legislation planned by the European Union, and it needs to be pointed out to the constitution’s detractors that it, for the first time, puts local government on a legal footing. In the event of any dispute as to whether, in accordance with the allocation of European competences, it is Europe or the nation-states that are competent, or if regional and local self-government is impaired, it is not merely politically but also legally of vast significance that the European Court of Justice can refer to the article that lays down how local communities govern themselves. There has been talk of ‘core Europe’ and multiple speeds, and I want to say how much I agree with what both Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch have said. Both have been Members of this House for a long time, so the slight differences of opinion that remain between them despite their intensive cooperation in the Convention can be overcome, and, should they be in need of conciliation, they will find plenty of members of our group ready and available. (Laughter)
 There is one goal in Europe towards which we must strive. We have one goal in common, and we want to reach it together. Those who talk in terms of a ‘core Europe’ basically want to revert to intergovernmental cooperation, and I can tell you that our group will not stand for it; we will counter it with determined resistance. Where there is a will there is a way ... (Applause)
 ... and we need to respect each other; more than anything else, we need to trust each other. We have confidence in you, Mr President-in-Office, in your government, in your Taoiseach, in the President of the European Council, in your foreign minister, in you personally and in Commissioner Barnier too – that is all I want to say about the Commission today – and, if we take this path together ... (Laughter)
 ... and with determination, defending the Community of Europe, then, I am convinced, we will eventually be successful. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, just before Christmas the political group chairmen had an opportunity to speak to the then-incoming Irish Presidency: with the Taoiseach, Foreign Minister Brian Cowen and the Minister for Europe, Dick Roche. I can tell you that the meeting was professional, efficient and amicable. I think this bodes very well for a successful Irish Presidency and by happy coincidence we have an Irish President of the European Parliament. I would also like to mention Gerard Collins, the co-chairman of an important group here in the European Parliament, who we first met when he was still Foreign Minister. The Irish Presidency of the time performed excellently, and I wish you every success in the coming six months as well. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the Constitution. For my group, for the European People’s Party section of it, the Constitution is the number one priority. The Constitution project cannot be allowed to fail simply because the Brussels Summit was unsuccessful. You will have our full support if you manage to resolve matters during the Irish Presidency. (Applause)
 Everyone needs to move into action now. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats may support the principle of double majority for decision-making in the Council of Ministers, but it cannot now be considered a fundamental principle whereby we say that if it is not accepted, the whole Constitution project will fail – certainly not. The Constitution is so important a subject that we must move towards one another. A compromise must be found, and we need everyone to work together to that end. (Applause)
 Then there is the discussion about ‘core Europe’ or a two-speed Europe. I would advise against any such discussion. It is inherently wrong. How would a core group work? How would a two-speed Europe work? It is the wrong approach, but it is also seen as a threat to make certain governments move in a particular direction. Let us stop talking about a two-speed Europe, let us create this Constitution and move forward together. (Applause)
 Mr President-in-Office, the elections for the European Parliament fall during your Presidency. The Convention’s draft Constitution says – although of course it is not yet in force – that the results of the European Parliament elections will be taken into account when the Commission President is appointed. I do not know whether your Presidency will actually make a proposal for the office of Commission President at the end of June, after the elections. I can only encourage and ask you to respect the results of the European Parliament elections if you do. It is a question of principle. Our group is not willing to repeat the events of 1999, when one side won the elections and the other side took up offices in the Commission. This time the results of the European elections must be taken into account. The Commission as a whole must be balanced. As President of the Commission – you are laughing, and I am always pleased to see you happy –you are already being asked for your opinion, even now, on the subject of appointing the ten Commissioners from the accession countries. Please ensure that there is a cross-party political balance when you appoint the Commissioners. (Loud applause)
 Mr President-in-Office, you went on to speak about our relationship with the United States of America. Let me underline everything you said. We do not want to be the United States’ lackeys, but neither are we her rivals. We want to be partners with the United States, with equal rights, speaking on an equal footing with our American friends, and on many issues we share common goals. Anyone who believes that Europe has to be defined by contrast with the United States not only has it wrong in treating the United States, as it were, as an enemy, but would also split Europe itself, because we have different views on how we should structure our relationship with the United States. Consequently, I can only advise that we consider ourselves partners and equals of the United States. It is up to us to establish that equality. Rather than constantly criticising American dominance, we should do our utmost to ensure we, as Europeans, are united, and then we will be on an equal footing with the United States. This does not mean that we ought not to criticise our American friends at all. For example, I consider the current situation in Guantanamo Bay unacceptable. No one on this earth – no terrorist, no one – should be without rights. Everyone in the world is subject to a system of law. We should tell our American friends so. Please include it in all documents we exchange with them. (Applause)
 The same holds true for Chechnya. We are always told: yes, yes, we have talked to the Russian President about Chechnya. We would like to see it in black and white: a statement that Chechnya will also be dealt with, that we will intervene to uphold human rights and that we also have the courage to address world leaders – or those who consider themselves as such – on such matters. So my request to you is: give human rights a chance, again by referring to them in documents and agreements. This applies both to Guantanamo Bay and to Chechnya. Let us respect one another: the small respecting the large, the large respecting the small, the majority respecting minorities. Europe can only work if we understand others, and if we respect one another. There should be no domination, and I thought it would be good to ask, in all modesty, everyone to do their bit. That is exactly what we need. Everyone needs to do their bit for a united Europe. Our group will stand alongside you. We wish you every success.

 Mr President, the agenda for this afternoon includes Mr Pex’s report on sanctions for pollution offences at sea. Mr Pex is well, as are Mr Doorn and others, and I am telling you that so that you are not dismayed by what I also have to tell you, which is that they have been in an aircraft accident. It would appear from what I have been told that the aircraft ran off the runway, but all of them are all right. Mr Pex has asked that his report should be taken today rather than being adjourned, and that it should be presented by Mr Bremmer, who, although he is not a member of the committee, is well-informed about the issue. I was more than willing to convey this request to you.

 Mr President, I did not actually want to make a statement, but, as a number of Members have spoken, I will do so after all. It must be absolutely plain to us in this House that we will not allow anyone – be they terrorists, anarchists or anyone else – to bring pressure to bear on us. We affirm that European integration is a labour of peace, of understanding and of reconciliation, from which nobody in Europe or anywhere in the world will succeed in diverting us. We should therefore consider how we can improve our security, but should also be utterly determined to press on with our labour of peace in uniting Europe. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say – speaking on behalf of the Members belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – that 13 December 2003 was not a good day for Europe. We are disappointed, but, in our disappointment, in the darkness, a light shines, for it was on 13 December 2003 that we got the news that the Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen had been awarded to the President of the European Parliament and thus to Parliament itself, which shows that we have allies in the cause of a strong, democratic, and active Europe. Mr President, we congratulate you on this distinction. (Applause)
 That the Intergovernmental Conference has failed must not mean that the Constitution has failed. Let me say, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that there must be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution, that we declare our determination that there should be one, and that we are striving to have one as soon as possible, because without a constitution, Europe has no future in the twenty-first century. (Applause)
 We want a European constitution, because, in a community of 450 million people – and perhaps eventually even more – it is the only foundation for our peaceful progress through the twenty-first century. We need a constitution so that the problems that arise in our society can be resolved on the basis of law. We need a European constitution in order to be able to defend our European values in the world. Let there be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution founded upon Community law. We will stubbornly resist any attempt to take us back to mere intergovernmental cooperation or to the formation on our continent of axes squaring up to each other. (Applause)
 I would like to thank the Italian Presidency and the President of the European Council for having managed to get agreement – as you said – on 82 points. My appeal to all those in positions of leadership is this: let us not again unwrap this package; let us instead focus on the few contentious issues that remain. No one European government is in the right, and nor will we get caught up in apportioning blame, for once started on that, we will soon come to recognise that almost all of us bear a large part of the responsibility for Brussels having been inconclusive. Rather than holding just one, two or three countries responsible, we now need the good will of all. We need a compromise; our willingness to compromise has always been a distinctive characteristic of Europe, for compromise is an expression of our shared goodwill, of our mutual trust, and of our desire to go forward into the future together. Let me make it perfectly clear that if a government thinks – and I am putting this in very abstract terms – that it can get out of European solidarity and defend only its own national interests, then such a government will, if that is how it behaves in future, be excluding itself from European solidarity. Solidarity is not a one-way street; it is binding upon all, and so it is that the practice of solidarity is in the national interest, because those nations that withdraw from European solidarity will end up having no part to play in Europe. (Loud applause)
 Today, we hear people pondering the idea of a ‘core Europe’, but how is that meant to work? A ‘core Europe’ is no solution, for the problems on which the few agree are always different ones. One group will agree on monetary issues; another on defence matters, and yet another on questions relating to the environment. It is for that reason that a ‘core Europe’ is no solution. We must walk together; together we must take the road that leads to Europe’s future. (Applause)
 I urge everyone to join in seeking out this road. People’s questions to me betray their concern; this very morning, a renowned European journalist asked me whether the euro would still be there in ten years’ time. Let us defend what we have achieved in Europe rather than jeopardising it. Certainly, what we need right now is a moment to pause and to consolidate, but let me tell you that we should now be thinking about Europe’s need for clear foundations in the shape of a constitution. We should not already be talking about further enlargements of the European Union that could put the whole concept of European integration even more at risk. (Applause)
 I would like to conclude by reiterating my gratitude to the Italian Presidency for its goodwill. We know how difficult things are in Europe, but Europe will indeed suffer harm if we now lack the will to keep on working on the basis of what the Convention produced. Next Thursday and Friday, we will be in Dublin, and I hope that the Irish Presidency will do everything in its power, starting by sounding out the individual governments as to their positions, so that the foreign ministers can then achieve a result that will enable, in due time, a summit of the European Union to be held, at which the European Constitution can be adopted. In this responsibility we all share. This is not a day for apportioning blame, but a day in which, despite the difficult situation in Europe, to have faith and to keep working on Europe – with patience, but also with the passion that the task demands. Our group is determined that this Europe should be a success, and for it to be that, we need a European constitution. (Loud applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, the decisions taken by the Ecofin Council on 25 November 2003 meant that it was not a good day for Europe. It was not a good day for European law. It was not a good day for the European Monetary Union. It was not a good day for relations between the smaller countries and the larger ones, and it was not a good day for the forthcoming enlargement. Those who, in the nineties, put the case for the Stability and Growth Pact now bear responsibility for the damage done to it, as do those who helped do the damage. We, in our group, are fundamentally convinced that we cannot be opportunistic in the way we use European law. So long as there is European regulation, so long as there is European law, it must be adhered to rather than bent. We do not believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is dead; it would be wrong to say that it were, for that would enable all those who break it to evade responsibility, both now and in the future. The Stability and Growth Pact has, however, been seriously damaged. Speaking very generally, what we need in politics is trust; Europe’s currency, this young European currency, needs a very special kind of trust, and that trust has been damaged. To you, Commissioner Solbes, I would like to express our group’s gratitude and appreciation for the way you fought right up to the end. You may well not have got a majority for what you wanted, but we are convinced that you are right. Losing can sometimes be an honourable thing, but you have won your case. (Applause)
 We also give our backing to the European Central Bank, and we wish its President, Mr Trichet, every success in continuing in future to be effective in contending for the stability of the European currency. We have now heard one finance minister in particular coming out with preposterous arguments to justify why this deficit is necessary right now in order for us to achieve growth. This argument is utterly false. Today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes. What we owe today we will take away from people tomorrow. (Applause)
 Those who run up excessive debts today are behaving exactly like those who are today despoiling our environment, for today’s younger generation and generations yet to come will have to pay the price for it. We therefore demand sustainability not only of a moderate finance and budget policy, but also in environment policy, and these things all belong together. Debts lead to higher interest rates, and these lead to higher inflation. We therefore end up without the money for low-interest loans enabling business and small enterprises to invest, and then no jobs are created for lack of finance at reasonable rates. At the end of the day it will be those on low incomes, it will be what we always used to call the man in the street, who will end up picking up the bill, and so a policy of running up debt is, in essence, anti-social, because it affects most those who have least. Such a policy also damages relations between the countries within the European Union. We have seen how Portugal and Ireland were required to adopt stability measures – quite rightly, as it turned out – and if these countries do it and other countries do it, but some think that they are big enough not to have to take these steps, then the ones who adhere to the criteria end up paying the bill for those who do not. That is why the policy is wrong. I would appreciate it if you were to listen; I ask you to hear me out.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following European Union enlargement on 1 May 2004 we will have an additional frontier with Russia, not only through Finland, but also through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and our relations with Russia will be even more important. We are very clear when we say that we want to seek a strategic partnership with Russia, because we know that relations between the European Union and Russia are crucial for peace and stability on our continent in the twenty-first century. I would like to thank my fellow Member Arie Oostlander most sincerely for negotiating a text with the other groups. We have here a text from six groups that reflects our opinion. We expressly recognise the progress that Russia has made on the road to democracy, but it is also a sign of partnership that the deficits we see are addressed openly. The President-in-Office has spoken of the elections in Russia, and elections can only take place if society is free from fear. Elections can only take place if people have enough information. Elections can only take place if the political system is fair. Elections can only take place where there is the rule of law. That is where there are deficits. We have reports that Russian citizens are afraid to protest when they find the state behaving wrongly. In our legal order, it is taken for granted that we can protest against any administrative act, at whatever level. That is why it is important for democratic development in Russia and for stability in Russia – stability is unthinkable without freedom, without democracy – that Russia should make progress in making democracy and the rule of law a reality. Chechnya is an open wound in Europe, not just in Russia. We must insist that the Chechen people are not equated with terrorists or bandits, but that the Chechen people are granted autonomy within the Russian Federation, as is the case with Tatarstan, for example. It would be a tragedy if, in the necessary fight against terrorism in the world – and we are resolutely for the fight against terrorism –, the Chechen people were ultimately to pay the price of terrorism. I say quite calmly, but my words are addressed to the Council and the Commission, that if we hold a summit with Russia and issue a declaration, then the most important topical issue cannot be left out of the official document. (Applause)
 My plea for the future is therefore that we do this, and I expressly acknowledge that the Council Presidency said something about it in its statement of 8 October. However, it is also important that we agree on a common policy and therefore on a formulation when meeting with the Russian president. We support the inclusion of Russia in the Bologna process. We need scientific and cultural exchange with Russia to prevent Russia turning away from Europe as it has often done in its history. We want partnership, we want a Russia that is turned towards Europe, and we must include young people in particular here. We urge Russia finally to sign and ratify the border agreement with Estonia and Latvia and we promise our future Member States Estonia and Latvia support in that, because their concerns are our concerns, the concerns of the European Union. We call upon Russia finally to take the necessary steps. We want to be Russia’s partner, and if we criticise one thing or another, we do so because we want to see democracy made a reality in Russia and because we want to live in peace, friendship and partnership with the Russian people.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish to express our sense of grief for the murdered Italian soldiers and carabinieri
 and also the Iraqi citizens who fell victim to this hideous crime. We also wish to voice our outrage at the criminals in Istanbul and convey our respects and sympathy to the families and survivors there. There are situations in political life when one would gladly avoid making certain statements or adopting a particular type of speech. Unfortunately, however, I have no choice but to make my views plain, and I do so calmly and objectively, as I do not wish to create even more waves in Italy’s public debate after the events of last week. Mr Prodi, you deemed it appropriate to launch a political manifesto in Italy last week. This manifesto, Mr Prodi, is not our problem, although it could be argued that if you present a comprehensive policy programme, this should not be in response to a country’s domestic political situation; the place for this would have been the European Parliament. That also needs to be said, ... (Heckling, sustained applause)
 ... but that is not my main point. Mr Cohn-Bendit, you will undoubtedly have an opportunity to express your views. As a democrat, kindly let me express mine. My main point of criticism, Mr Prodi, is that you have engaged in party politics. You have called on a specific political movement, namely the Italian left, to join forces, thus creating ... (Applause)
 ... the impression that there are on the one side people who are pro-reform and pro-Europe, while on the other side there are those who are not pro-Europe. Let me say, on behalf of my group, that every single member of our group shares the passion for Europe, and we should not drive a wedge between Europeans, neither in Italy nor in Europe. (Applause)
 Nor can it be claimed that this was a declaration made in a private capacity, for it comes from the President of the Commission. Anyone who is the Commission President always acts on behalf of all Europeans. I share the view of our fellow MEP Mr Barón Crespo: if the Commission President heads the list for the European elections, he must resign from office. In fact, Mr President, my comments in Corriere della Sera
 prompted you, ... (Applause
 ... finally to make it clear that you will remain in office until the end of your term on 1 November 2004. We welcome this clarification, but even members of your Commission were still saying last week that there were rumours you might be standing as a list candidate in the European elections. Thankfully, you have now clarified your position. Nonetheless, this state of affairs – this rumour mill – has also harmed the Commission and I mention it here because it needs to be mentioned. (Applause)
 Anyone who holds high office in the European Union should always bear in mind that every time they speak, they do so for the European Union as a whole. Indeed, if Corriere della Sera
 had called me to ask me about the statements made by the President of the European Council on Chechnya, I would still have said that I did not agree with the sort of declaration you have issued. We are trying to be objective. We want to serve Europe, and that is why we must not divide Europe. (Applause)
 Mr Prodi, let me remind you that on 15 September 1999, you were appointed with the support and trust of our group, even though you do not belong to our political family. We gave your Commission our trust, even though the majority of your Commissioners – contrary to the outcome of the elections – do not belong to our political family. I welcome the fact that the constitutional draft states that in future, the outcome of the European elections will be taken into account when a candidate is proposed for the office of Commission President. (Applause)
 Commissioner Solbes, I hope to hear a word or two on the stability of the European currency. I believe this is an issue which you will also be addressing today, Mr Prodi. I would like to give encouragement to your Commission and thank Commissioner Solbes in particular – whom we regard as the guarantor of European currency stability – for maintaining this course, not only towards the small countries but also the large countries in the European Union. (Applause)
 Mr Antonione, I particularly appreciate the fact that the representative of the Council is here today. This should be taken as read, but this was not the case in the past. I welcome the fact that you are here today, and I would like to give you our encouragement and call on you, at the Intergovernmental Conference, not to endorse the ideas floating around in some finance ministers’ minds, namely to reduce the rights of this House on budgetary issues, which we will resist resolutely. I would ask you to make it plain that you side with the European Parliament on this issue and that we want equality between this House and the Council of Ministers on the European Union budget. (Applause)
 Let me conclude with comments which I make with a great deal of personal regard, as the Commission President is aware, although personal affinity and political issues must be kept separate; criticism cannot be brushed under the carpet out of a sense of personal regard. It is essential to speak the truth. Mr Prodi, you are the President of all the Europeans. You hold the highest office in the European Union. Give us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the opportunity to give you our trust until the end of your term in office on 1 November 2004. If you prove that you can earn it, you will have our support. (Applause)

President Prodi, what I am going to say to you I say as a personal ally, as one who shares many of your European ideals, and I say it with regret that you have not gone over the bridge that I have built for you. It is not the manifesto that is at issue, and it is tendentious to reiterate that I, when I gave the interview to ‘Corriere della Sera’ last Monday evening, had not yet read the manifesto. I based my criticisms on an agency report, according to which you had given a recommendation to a party political list in Italy, and that is not compatible with your role as President of the European Commission! (Vigorous applause, heckling)
 Let me make it perfectly clear – and Mr Barón Crespo’s statement shows that I cannot be wrong in this – that the office of President of the European Commission is not compatible with being on a list of candidates in the European elections, and that this ought to result in your resignation. This comment, though, hung in the air. There was the question in your own college of whether you would carry on with your mandate until 1 November 2004. Thank God you clarified that, but the mere fact that these rumours could surface is not something for which we can applaud you. Mr President, I say this to you very much as a friend, but also in all earnest and also in restrained language: you need the support not only of one side of this House. If you carry on like this, we will, in future, no longer be able to support you. (Vigorous applause, heckling)
 We need a Commission – this is not party polemics, but my profound conviction ... (Laughter)
 ... we need a Commission at a difficult time, when we face enlargement, at a difficult time in which we have a constitution, and we need neither a Commission nor a Commission President who constantly meddles in the internal political debates in his own country, a country, let it be added, which still holds the Presidency of the European Union. (Vigorous applause, heckling)
 President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether the confidence of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats ... (Heckling)
 ... and you call yourselves democrats, when you do not even listen to what is being said? We always listen when your group chairman speaks, and that is good democratic practice. I will therefore conclude by saying this: President Prodi, it is for you alone to decide whether you want us, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to be alongside you. We want you to succeed because we all share in your success, but you yourself must be prepared to cross this bridge. If you are not prepared to cross this bridge, then you yourself must bear responsibility for the consequences. (Sustained applause and heckling)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all rejoice that we have got as far as we have, and for that I want to extend warm thanks to the Commission, to its President Mr Prodi, and to Commissioner Verheugen. Having said that, I intend to keep it brief. You mentioned the material that has been published. I find it intolerable that certain things should get into the press without Parliament having the documents in question. Commissioner Verheugen, to what do you attribute this state of affairs? (Applause)
 Now for my second question. Whilst I would encourage you to work towards the candidate countries actually implementing what has been agreed, I would also ask you whether it is not the case that we have to set them a good example, for example in matters of stability policy? Do we not also, for our part, have to do everything possible to adhere to the Treaties, in order to give a good example to our future partners in the European Union? My third point has to do with Turkey. We are all very glad that Turkey has chosen this particular way forward. The Turks are our friends and partners, but do we not also have to distinguish between that which is theoretical and what is put into practice? Where Turkey’s membership is concerned, I ask you to consider the possibility of another form of relationship, for example by way of a privileged partnership. The majority in our group favours good, strong and neighbourly relations founded upon a privileged partnership. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference was at the heart of the Brussels Summit, and our group welcomes the Italian Presidency’s determination and goodwill in intending to come up with a result in time for the Summit on 12/13 December. We wish to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in your endeavours to bring this about, for, if the Intergovernmental Conference drags itself out into 2004, there is an even greater risk of further chapters being opened, with the result that we will not come to a conclusion. We therefore urge you to do everything to enable a result to be achieved under your presidency. We are alongside you in doing so. As regards the institutional issues, we urge that any solution to the problem of the Commission’s composition should be satisfactory to both the large and small countries. We warn against the mere acknowledgement that the larger countries have claims, for the smaller ones, too, are entitled to appropriate representation, and this is an issue I wish you much success in resolving. If you manage to do so, then it will also be possible to resolve the issue of the European Council’s Presidency and of its composition. As regards the voting in the Council of Ministers, the overwhelming majority in our group is not of one mind; there are one or two exceptions, but the overwhelming majority favours the dual-majority principle as proposed by the Convention. We take the view that the Convent has put before us a proposal that is in line with the Community method, and one that we should allow to succeed. Turning to the Legislative Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we insist that transparency and continuity be introduced into the legislative work of the European Council of Ministers. This is an area in which we must not revert to old-style secret diplomacy, with it not being known what goes on behind the doors of the Council of Ministers. (Applause)
 One problem that we must resolve is the Maastricht issue, that of price stability. Although price stability is a constituent element in the Constitution, nowhere do we see the 3% deficit limit being kept to, and general requirement to maintain price stability is of little use if it lacks an explicit basis. We therefore ask that it be ensured that clear and quantifiable bases, with reference to protocols, are in place in order that price stability should not exist merely in theory, but may, in practical terms too, remain a central element in our common policy. If I may comment on the external borders, it is with great joy that I have heard that Mr Berlusconi, the President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, have come to an agreement on immigration matters. We in the European Union do, of course, need our external borders to be protected, but our concern is that protection of the external borders resolves only part of the problem, which is a profoundly human one. The sight of wretched, hungry, thirsty people, including children – such as we have seen on the shores of the island of Lampedusa – shows that this is not just about the protection of our external borders, but about these pitiable people being given a chance in their own countries and not needing to get in their boats. That is why it is important that border controls should be carried out within the countries from which these people emigrate and that developments in them should be brought to completion so as to make it possible for young people to look forward to a proper, good, and decent future in their own homeland. To that end, we, the European Union, have our own contribution to make in the Mediterranean region. The word ‘Guantanamo’ featured in my notes – with which I can now dispense – even before we heard of Mr Watson’s symbolic and expressive action in the Chamber. We take the view that major problems are adequately addressed by the use of persuasion. Our concern is not only with the twenty-six Europeans, but also with all those who are detained in Guantanamo. Whilst we are all in favour of combating terrorism, our Christian conception of man teaches us that every human being, even the worst of criminals, has the right to be tried in accordance with the law. (Applause)
 We therefore appeal to our American friends to abide by the principles of human rights. Consider, if you will, that these 600 detainees include five or six who have done nothing. What harm is being done to these people, and how unjustly they are being treated! That is the actual crux of our European attitude to the death penalty. Even if only one person is wrongly executed, that is sufficient reason to deny the death penalty any justification whatever. (Applause)
 What I say to the Americans I say as one who thinks of himself as one of their friends, urging them to understand our position, which is founded on the rule of law and on human dignity, that every human being is of equal worth, whatever the colour of their skin, their gender, or their nationality. Let me turn, for my final comments, to the subject of European defence. I speak as one who had the pleasure of serving for ten years as chairman of Parliament’s security and disarmament subcommittee, when we always supported Europe’s strong defence capacity as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance. We want the North Atlantic Alliance to be founded on the twin pillars of Europe and the USA, and we would ask our American friends to understand why we are reinforcing Europe’s defences. Far from this being in opposition to the US, we seek to complement each other, and want to be strong together. At the heart of this is our joining in defending our common values. It is on that foundation that any common European defence policy must rest. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we face a very tragic situation in the Middle East. We all thought that after the Iraq War, more intensive efforts would be made to find a solution to this apparently unending Middle East conflict. Unfortunately, this hope has not become reality. We appear to be in a situation of hopelessness, and the spiral of violence is continuing to escalate. On behalf of our group, I would like to state very clearly that every suicide bombing is a crime against the young people who carry it out and a crime against the Israelis whom they take with them into death. This must be made very clear. We also say, however, that the ‘selective murder’ response, as Mr Solana has said – the policy of ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’ – does not help to make peace possible. I would like to thank Commissioner Monti for what he said about the wall, for his great ability – we know he has other abilities as well – but I would particularly like to thank him for saying what he did, and for the way he said it. I would like to thank him very warmly for that. If you would permit me to make a personal remark, I can trace my political commitment back to when, at the start of 1962, I saw a wall in my own country. That is something that profoundly affects people’s hearts and spirits. I am profoundly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that the construction of this wall is a very great tragedy. It is a tragedy for Israel too, because it will simply lead to more hatred and revulsion. It is not a measure that will genuinely promote peace, and in my view, the wall will not increase Israel’s security either. It must also be said that the illegal settlements are an ongoing factor preventing a peaceful solution. Let me say, not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of my parliamentary group, that if a wall is constructed which leads to more hatred and more humiliation, this is a further argument, to my mind, for having an international peacekeeping force to keep the two hostile parties apart. I hope that a debate will begin, for once, about whether an international peacekeeping force … (Applause)
 … involving Europeans would be a way forward. From our point of view, it is clear that the aim must be for Israel to exist in secure borders. The aim must also be a Palestinian state in secure borders. We call on the key actors – Prime Minister Sharon, President Arafat, and the new Prime Minister Abu Ala – to give peace a chance and to overcome what are perhaps personal dislikes. Dialogue is essential, and Mr Solana, I would like to thank you particularly for what you are doing. I believe you really are doing what you have described, and that you are working day and night and talking to the key actors. Now, of course, the development must continue. As desperate as the situation may appear, human and political life is never entirely hopeless, for if it were, we would have to give up our efforts altogether. For this reason, a further effort is required from the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia to ensure that the actors on both sides start talking to each other again. Perhaps we have an even greater responsibility than our American friends. After all, we always demand a great deal from the Americans. We criticise them when they do something and we criticise them when they do not. As Europeans, we should now, for once, take the initiative, especially since our American friends have other concerns with the start of the presidential election campaign – and we know how important are the groups in America whose support a candidate needs in order to be elected. We Europeans should therefore launch a genuine initiative here. Let me conclude by saying something that especially concerns the issue of human dignity. There are no second-class people. Everyone is equal, and everyone is equal in human dignity. This applies to the Europeans, it applies to the Americans, it applies to the Palestinians, it applies to the Israelis, and it applies to the Chechens and to everyone in the world. In the European Union, we are currently in the process of adopting a constitution, and this constitution is a process underpinned by values. I think we would do well to make people the focal point, and that is why we must adopt initiatives at this time to ensure that the dignity of the Palestinians is respected and the dignity of the Israelis is respected and that both nations have the chance to move into the future together in peace, in a democratic system. We should play a strong and pro-active role in this context. I would like to thank Mr Solana very warmly for all that he has contributed to date, and I hope that we will be more successful in future than we have been so far. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is starting much later than planned, and I would like to apologise because as soon as I finish speaking I will leave to attend another important engagement. This is something I have never done before. I know we all have other commitments, and I was engaged to be elsewhere at 5 p.m. I hope that there will be no repetition of today’s delays. The summit of Heads of State or Government in the spring of 2002 did expressly set itself a very ambitious objective, namely to create the most competitive economy in the world. This claim always reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Soviet Union wanted to outdo the US. We know how that ended. Slightly more moderate language would make our present situation – namely the lack of progress – a little easier. At the same time, we have to ensure that Europe’s economy becomes more competitive. In order for that to happen, two key conditions must first be met. One is the reform of our social system, and the other is greater flexibility in labour markets. Happily, people are living longer, but this also presents a massive challenge to our social system. Our group feels very strongly that we have to introduce more independence and self-sufficiency into our social systems. We need to make the labour market more flexible, because if the labour market stays as it is, if we maintain the status quo
, people out of work will be hit particularly hard, and these are the very people we want to see return to work. Our group would therefore like to encourage governments which are undertaking a tough reform process to address this issue to keep going, in order to provide us with answers for the future that offer genuine, viable solutions for today’s younger generation. The best policy approach for jobs, companies, and particularly for medium-sized companies, is a moderate taxation policy. The less taxes companies have to pay, the more they will be willing to invest in Europe. Today, we know that it is because our current economic system is so bureaucratic and often has very high taxation, that our companies invest outside the European Union. We can therefore only encourage policies which offer the best for medium-sized companies, with maximum transparency in taxation, to show that investment within the European Union is worthwhile, rather than forcing companies, as is increasingly the case, to invest outside the European Union. My colleague Mr Karas, our economic policy coordinator, whom I see here, spoke, about Basel II a few weeks ago. We also have to ensure that Basel II does not make it harder for medium-sized companies to invest. Instead we need to conclude worldwide agreements and organise Basel II in such a way that it is possible for medium-sized companies to take out loans and pay them back under reasonable conditions. Then there is the question of European bureaucracy and the self-inflicted tangles of red tape. Here I am addressing the President of the Commission. We are eagerly awaiting the Commission proposals for chemicals legislation. But if this legislation on chemicals results in European companies again investing outside the European Union because of the thousands of regulations imposed upon them and leaving the European market, then it will lead to further job losses and consequently a less competitive Europe. We would therefore caution against tying the European economy up in more red tape through national or European legislation. Let me comment briefly on the question of the stability of the euro. There are some people who believe we now ought to go well beyond the 3% figure established under Maastricht for new borrowings. I can only advise against such a step. If we enter into new borrowings now, those loans will have to be repaid, and the money used to make the repayments will then not be available for investment. It is investment that creates jobs. For this reason the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats recognises the need to uphold the stability criteria, although obviously we do acknowledge the difficulties that national governments are facing. The President of the Commission and, I believe, the President-in-Office of the Council, have talked about how important it is to do something for education and research. We cannot continue to allow ever more young scientists to go to the United States and thus be lost to us. This represents a loss not only of human potential, but also of the future potential of Europe. The issue must therefore be addressed more directly. To close, I would like to make a couple of brief remarks about Europe’s borders and the protection of them. It is a very important topic, but I wonder whether it is necessary to create a new border management agency, as set out in the European Council paper. Can we not tackle the problems using existing structures? I am just airing the question now. Let me also encourage the Presidency not to limit discussions at the conference on the Mediterranean dialogue in December to the very important question of borders. Rather, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to also consider how we can help countries to help themselves, particularly those Mediterranean countries which are not members of the European Union, in order to prevent people climbing into boats in order to reach the borders of the European Union, resulting in the tragedies that we keep seeing in the Mediterranean. My last words are a request to the President-in-Office of the Council, and one I think he will follow up. I would like to encourage the President-in-Office to do his utmost to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference comes to agreement by the end of the year. Please do not allow every page of the Convention’s proposals to be completely renegotiated. Concentrate on the three or four key points. We will support you in your efforts to achieve a result, because we need a European constitution. A European constitution is the basis on which this European Union, which will soon comprise twenty-five Member States and 450 million people, will be able to make the decisions it needs to make, will be able to act, to be democratic, and to uphold parliamentary principles. So let me encourage you to concentrate your efforts during the presidency on the constitution. It is the top priority for these six months. (Applause)

I find it regrettable that the majority in the European Parliament has not supported the amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats aimed at incorporating especial reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots in the draft Constitution. Even in its present form, however, the Constitution contains elements that are important in terms of Europe’s Christian heritage, in that the preamble refers to Europe’s religious inheritance, and the Christian conception of mankind becomes one of the Constitution’s important foundations through the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 51 of the draft Treaty, moreover, gives explicit recognition to the status of the churches and non-confessional organisations. So the Constitution includes important features relating to Europe’s religious heritage. By means of its amendment, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sought to add another important dimension to these elements. It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference, and hence for the Member States, to take on board this proposal and add it to the draft Constitution.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East appears to be hopeless. After the removal of the Iraqi dictator, we had all hoped for a new and peaceful order in the Middle East. This hope proved to be false, and it appears as if all efforts for peace, and the roadmap, have come to nothing. Mahmud Abbas has been replaced by Ahmed Kurei after only four months in power. Personalities are of course important, and we also know that the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat are the decision-makers, but, in essence, this is about the people of these countries. Prime Minister Sharon is democratically elected; so is President Arafat. I do not know whether his election meets all the democratic criteria, but he is elected. He is also a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, something that should perhaps spur the Israeli Government and the Palestinians to get back to the common ground that President Arafat once shared with the Israeli Prime Minister Rabin. We are all familiar with the enormous problems that we face. In our group, we are perfectly clear in our own minds that we can in no way justify the suicide attacks, which hold human life in contempt. They constitute an abuse of the young people to whom promises of paradise are made, and they involve the murder of other innocent people. They bring about a vicious circle of violence; another result of them is Israel’s death lists, which we can in no way approve of, since – as Commissioner Lamy and Mr Antonione have said – it is not only the hunted criminals, or those assumed to be such, but also a very large number of innocent people who end up being killed. A policy of ‘an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’ will bring no resolution. Just as we hear Hamas and Islamic Jihad speaking the language of hatred, we also see the deeds of hatred, and all this leads to further escalations. There are also Israel’s illegal settlements in Western Jordan, which are a constant provocation for the people in Palestine. Let me quote this from the 8 September issue of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
: ‘The symbolic removal of a few containers in illegal settlements west of the Jordan was too little for it to have been capable of becoming an encouraging experience of success for the Palestinians.’ The building of a wall rams home the deep sense of constant humiliation felt in Palestine. We must seek to enable both Israel and Palestine to live within secure borders, and we declare that all the people of that region – Israelis and Palestinians alike – are endowed with the same dignity. That is why, despite the apparent hopelessness, there is no alternative to pressing on with the efforts towards peace. I am speaking personally rather than on behalf of my group when I say that I do not believe that a peaceful solution will be possible without an international military peacekeeping force. Unless an international military peacekeeping force is used to keep the two sides off each other, I do not believe that a solution will be possible. Nor can we expect the Americans to do everything – their elections mean, in any case, that they are less capable of acting in this area. I rejoice at the common purpose that is apparent here, and it is as the European Union that we should persist in our efforts together with the USA, with the UN, and with Russia. We must persist in our efforts, for it is the people of the Middle East who are at stake.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our commitment to Europe has as its goal an active, democratic and transparent European Union, one that is founded on values, principles and rules. This proposal for a European constitution sees us taking a decisive step closer to that goal, and it is a great joy to be able to welcome President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, a former member of our group, to this House as President of the Convention. I do not want to repeat what the Liberals have had to say on the subject. President Giscard, I have a clear recollection of how, in January 1992, when Egon Klepsch, the chairman of our group, was elected President of the European Parliament, I stood behind you as we together – you first, with me following modestly behind – cast our votes for Leo Tindemans as group chairman. If, back in 1992, somebody had said that Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would, in September 2003, put before the European Parliament a constitutional treaty, a constitution for Europe, I would have said that was wonderful, that it was a dream, a vision! That this dream has become reality is something in which we can rejoice with all our hearts. To you, President Giscard d’Estaing, I want to address a special word of gratitude and appreciation. I might add that I have never doubted that the outcome would be a good one, for you met in our group’s chamber, although I will readily concede that it was once home to another group. I would also like to express warm thanks to our members of the Praesidium, Mr Iñigo Méndez de Vigo, Mr Klaus Hänsch, and, representing all our Members in the Convention, their chairman, Mr Elmar Brok, and our colleagues in the Convention. You will all have the opportunity to take the floor at our second September sitting, when we will be discussing the reports by Mr Gil-Robles and Mr Tsatsos. The Convention’s methodology has turned out to be the right one, as, post-Nice, we had said in the presence of the President of the European Council that we needed another methodology, and our group has always put the case for a Convention. It is no secret that, within our group, which is a large one, the PPE component has priorities that differ from those of the DE element, which is made up of our British friends, but what I can say, on behalf of our group as a whole, is that it is the allocation of competences within Europe that is vital. Our goal is an active Europe, not a centralist Europe. Where common action by Europeans is called for, Europe must be able to act. Not everything that calls for action in Europe calls for action by Europe, but, where Europe is required to act, Europe must be strong. We are now defining what the areas for European action are. It is now for the nation states to say where they have to act, what are the regions’ areas for action, and where action has to be by the municipalities. It is very much to be welcomed that this constitutional treaty guarantees the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and the right of appeal for all national parliaments, and that there is an elaborate network of balances interconnecting the different levels of the European Union. We especially welcome the way in which a place has also been found in the constitution for local self-government. I do not know the exact percentage, but Parliament will have equal rights of codecision on over 90% of legislation, and transparency is at last introduced into the Council of Ministers, which must no longer legislate behind closed doors. It is on the basis of the elections to the European Parliament that the President of the Commission must be nominated. Even now, I call upon the Heads of State or Government to take into account the results of the 2004 European parliamentary elections – no matter what the result; my concern is with the principle – when nominating the President of the Commission, even if the constitution is not yet in force by the time the elections are held. (Applause)
 We have, as a group, seen it as very important that the Foreign Minister, too, should be subject to approval by vote of the European Parliament. We have not, of course, got everything we wanted, nor could we have done. We would have liked the constitution to incorporate a reference to our Judaeo-Christian heritage. We would have liked decisions in foreign and security policy to be based on the principle of majority voting, and we are well aware of the difficulties involved in working out the votes in the Council. I believe that most of us will agree with me when I warn, in the strongest terms, against now undoing this elaborate compromise. Mr Fini, Mr Frattini, we want the European Parliament to have representatives – I am deliberately avoiding the term ‘observers’ – at the Intergovernmental Conference, who will have every facility afforded them to play their part in its work. That is what I have to ask of you. Let me conclude by saying that the project on the table before us is a great one. At this Intergovernmental Conference, great responsibilities will rest upon your shoulders. There are vast opportunities involved, but also immense dangers, and, on behalf of all of us, I wish you every success, for what this is about is our having, in the twenty-first century, a legal basis on which to peacefully resolve the differences and conflicts of interest that we in Europe have, so that peace may be secured by law, and I wish you great success at the Intergovernmental Conference!

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Berlusconi, you received loud applause for your speech here in the European Parliament. I hope that will be indicative of the success of the Italian Presidency that we all expect and hope for. I would like to make a request to everyone, no matter what side of the House you are on, that certain debates taking place in all the Member States of the European Union should not be escalated to European level, and in that way prevent us from achieving our objectives at that level. We must now achieve the great and ambitious objectives before us. (Applause from the right)
 Let me spell this out clearly: my group will be monitoring the Italian Presidency objectively, fairly and in a spirit of constructive criticism, just as it does with every presidency. Sometimes people have no sense of symbolism. However, I am very aware of all the competent people representing Italy not just here in Parliament, but also in the European Council and on the Commission: you yourself, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Fini, who has represented you in the Convention and played an important part in its work, Mr Frattini, Italy's Foreign Minister, Mr Buttiglione, Italy's Minister for Europe, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and last but not least the Italian Commissioner Mario Monti. I was very pleased that your own comments and those of the Commission President were in agreement. Just at the moment we cannot help thinking about 25 March 1957, when the Rome Treaties were signed on the Capitol in Rome. You now have the fantastic task – some might see it as a burden, but it really is a splendid opportunity – of making your own contribution by means of specific actions, so that at the end of this year we will be able to say that we have the European Constitution of Rome, which will then be signed in Rome, on the Capitol perhaps, by when the ten new countries from central and southern Europe, that is Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus and their citizens will belong to the European Union. What a great moment in history! I do not know if I should offer your Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, my condolences or congratulations on the fact that in the coming weeks and months he will have the enormous task, reporting to you, Mr President-in-Office, of carrying out the practical work needed to achieve that goal. Let me reassure the Italian Presidency and all our friends in Italy that my group will do its utmost to ensure that this will be a great success and that we will be able to achieve a European Constitution. (Applause from the right)
 Mr President-in-Office, I would specifically like to thank you for repeating here today – and I think that this involved a departure from your written text – what you said last week in Rome to the Conference of Presidents. You said that you would ensure that, when Heads of State and Government meet, then our own President will of course also be present, and that representatives of the European Parliament will also be present when the foreign ministers meet to discuss the constitution. I would like to thank you for that assurance, but we will be watching to make sure that this actually happens. I would like to repeat the sincere thanks I addressed yesterday to our representatives in the Praesidium of the Convention, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo and Klaus Hänsch, for the excellent work they have done. My thanks to them also go to all the Members of this House who have participated in the Convention, including the chairman of our group in the Convention, Elmar Brok. We trust that, with Parliament’s support, it will now be possible to achieve a result by the end of the year. Mr President-in-Office, you talked about strong European institutions. Yesterday, in the presence of the President of the Italian Parliament, Ferdinando Casini, of Helmut Kohl, Honorary Citizen of Europe, of the French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and of many others, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of our group, and it was made clear once again that we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, stand for a Community of Europe, because we know that a return to mere cooperation between governments would be a step backwards. That is why Europe's institutions need to be strong, and in the final analysis that must be the outcome of the debate on the constitution. We know at the same time that we Europeans have our roots in our home countries, in our own regions, and that our European citizenship flows from our nationalities and the countries from which we come. A strong European Union does not therefore conflict with our home countries – it complements them. Unfortunately I do not have as much speaking time as the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. (Laughter and heckling)
 I therefore wish to limit myself to just one more point. Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned infrastructure projects. We will be looking at that very carefully. But we will also be asking ourselves this question: will the stability of the euro, which also needs to be represented abroad – and I particularly agree with you about that, Mr Prodi – be undermined by this? We do not want that to happen. We want to defend a strong euro and the stability of our new European currency. In conclusion I would like to say, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that we wish both you personally and your much-loved country, Italy, a resounding success. We also and above all wish that success for the sake of the European Union. I am delighted that my Socialist friends agree – if you can continue along those lines we will be able to talk about a shared success. If we can achieve that, it will for evermore be written in our history books that on 16 April 2003, 10 countries in Central and Southern Europe signed the accession treaties, and we will then have a European Constitution, signed in Rome, with effect from 1 May 2004. I wish you every success with that, and my group will continue to follow you along that path in a spirit of constructive criticism. (Applause from the right)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the PPE part of which is today celebrating its fiftieth birthday, has consistently provided very positive support to the Greek Presidency, in close cooperation with our Greek colleagues under the chairmanship of Antonios Trakatellis, but also with our friends in Greece, Nea Demokratia under the leadership of Konstantinos Karamanlis. This is what we promised you in Athens, Prime Minister, and we have kept our word because we know that your success is our shared success. The highlight of the Greek Presidency – and you were able to build on the good preparatory work done by the Danish Presidency and also on the European Parliament's decision of 9 April – was unquestionably the signature of the accession treaties on 16 April in the Stoa Attalou. When we alighted from the bus – and I should particularly like to thank you for inviting the group chairmen to this event, something that should set a precedent for other ceremonial occasions in the European Union – I had the good fortune to be able to accompany the first freely elected prime minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, down the steps at the side of the Acropolis to the Stoa Attalou, and we talked about the great change in Europe and the desire of the people of Central and Eastern Europe to live in freedom. The fact that the end of this process was marked as it were with the signature of the treaties in Athens is something that will never be forgotten, and we are grateful that we now have 162 observers with us from the accession countries. Unfortunately, however, your presidency has not just been a presidency of high points. As you mentioned yourself, your presidency has been overshadowed by the war in Iraq. I do not wish to look back in anger today either: I prefer to look to the future, and we must learn the lessons from the mistakes that we have made. Our first conclusion is that if national positions are to be adopted on an issue of foreign policy or if two or three countries wish to take a stance, then they are obliged first to consult all of their European Union partners and to resolve the issues together. We must act together and Europe, the European Union, must not go into these difficult decisions when it is already divided into two, three or four camps. Europeans must act together! The second point concerns the Convention. On certain issues, including our foreign and security policy, we must have the courage to decide by majorities, albeit by large, qualified majorities. If we keep unanimity we will not be able to reach common positions and this is one of our demands. My third point is that clearly partnerships are not easy, particularly when one partner is a superpower. But it is precisely if we in Europe want to be on an equal footing with our American friends that this European Security and Defence Policy needs to be formulated in such a way that it does not see America as an opponent, but as a partner, a country together with which we wish to solve problems on this earth. You referred quite rightly, Mr President-in-Office, to the difficult issues of asylum and immigration, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, whom I should also like to thank very warmly for his work, mentioned the joint administration of external borders. This is an important matter: we need to reach agreements with those countries from which these really pitiful people come, from which they set out in their boats, agreements in which they undertake to secure their borders. But I would insist that this is not solely a law enforcement issue, a task for the police. It is a problem that needs to be resolved above all in the countries of the Mediterranean and in North Africa, and that is why we need European Union assistance for these countries, and these countries have to reform so that the young people in them have a genuine future and do not put their lives in danger by setting off on their travels. We see this problem of immigration not only as a policing problem, but also as a fundamentally human problem and the key is to give people the chance of a future in their home countries. A further point is the Convention. I should particularly like to thank its President, Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, for his work, but also the two Members in the Convention Praesidium, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo from our group and Klaus Hänsch from the Socialist Group, as well as our group spokesman, Elmar Brok. We must now call for this draft constitution to form the basis for the work in the Convention and for the decision to be made in the Convention now on the basis of this draft constitution. We very much hope – and I will be saying this again tomorrow to the future President of the Council – that we can reach a result by the end of this year, so that swift and speedy progress can be made, and we also hope that the European Parliament will enjoy appropriate and effective representation. When the Heads of State and Government meet, the President of Parliament must be present; when the foreign ministers act, our parliamentary representatives should be there and not be as it were consigned to the level of administrators. The task before us is immense, but I believe that we can achieve it. I should like to thank you in particular, Mr President-in-Office, for your contribution to the Statute for European political parties. Admittedly this still needs to be formally adopted under the Italian Presidency, but the approach adopted was, I believe, the right one. As far as the Members' Statute is concerned, I hope that it will be possible here too to make further progress in the next few weeks and months. Finally, may I say that this presidency has had its highs and lows: I did not envy your position as President during the Iraq crisis and all that went with it. I was pleased for you on 16 April; you did your duty, as we would expect from a presidency, and I should like to thank you very much for this. Our group has provided you with fair, objective and positive support; I hope that you share this impression, because this is our shared Europe and a success for Europe is a success for us all.

 Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I should like to make the following comments about the Oostlander report. We have agreed to this report, because it would be a way of bringing Turkey closer to European standards. However, we attach importance to the conclusion that this report should not automatically be the start of anything. With regard to Turkey’s possible accession to the European Union, many members of our group do not share the view that it should join the European Union, although naturally we would like to have close and friendly relations with it as a partner. To that extent we believe it is important to state, having given our agreement to the Oostlander report, that, if and when it comes to a decision on Turkey’s membership of the European Union, it will be up to individuals to decide freely, that any such decision lies in the future, and that our agreement to the Oostlander report in no way forms a preliminary decision anticipating any such decision that may be taken in the future.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the President of the Commission received such warm applause, because he has really earned it. He deserved that warm applause for his comments, which were based on the Community method, and I too would like to focus my contribution on the Convention. I would first like to thank all our representatives to the Convention and its Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, very sincerely for all the work they have done up to now, although we have not reached our goal yet. If such clear progress had not been made over the past week, we might have found ourselves concerned about the risk of failure today. But I no longer have any such fears. Nevertheless, we need to make still further progress. My group firmly believes that there should be an agreed and definitive draft for the constitution, without any options. We do not want a proposal to emerge from the Convention that could be reopened by the Intergovernmental Conference. No, we want a final draft, a definitive programme, which we hope will then meet with the agreement of the governments. And there is one thing that we want above all: the preamble refers to our Greek and Roman heritage and to the Enlightenment, but we must insist that our Christian heritage is also referred to in the preamble of the European constitution, forming as it does part of our identity today. (Applause
) We as the European Parliament demand equal rights in framing all European legislation, and we also demand that we should share budget rights with the Council, including medium-term financial planning. As regards the Commission, we want a strong Commission, and we welcome the suggestion that the President should be proposed by the Heads of State and Government on the basis of the election results, and that Parliament should then choose the President of the Commission. We want a strong Commission, because it, together with Parliament, and of course with the European Court of Justice, forms the heart of the European Community. We are also calling for the Convention to find a solution as regards the size of the Commission, a solution that ensures that the Commission is able to act, but one that also ensures that all the Member States of the European Union are represented in the Commission. I say that because all Member States, large and small, want a place at the Commission table. It is quite possible to think of mechanisms, including both rotation and junior Commissioners, that allow not only the large Member States but also the small ones to have a place at the Commission table. This is of great psychological importance for our common European project. We are also calling for the European Foreign Minister, who is at the same time to be the Vice-President of the Commission, to be subject – together with the entire Commission – to a vote of approval by Parliament. A situation in which the Foreign Minister has no link with Parliament is not acceptable. He too needs to have Parliament’s approval and confidence, and that is why we want him to be linked into the Commission as a whole, which will then have to be approved by us. As far as the Council is concerned, I can very largely agree with what the President of the Commission and of course with what the President-in-Office of the Council has said, not in every detail, but in their broad thrust. In instances where the Council is acting as the legislature, we need genuine transparency, and, as a legislature, the Council must as a matter of principle take decisions by majority vote. That brings us to the issue of the presidency of the European Council. The Convention Praesidium's proposal contains a formula according to which the President of the European Council should not belong to another institution. This is just a personal opinion, but I believe it would be a good thing if this sentence were to be deleted. We need to keep open the option that one day, if we can reach that point, the President of the European Commission can also be the President of the European Council. That is why I hope that this sentence, which still figures in the proposal, will finally be deleted. (Applause)
 I am happy to give my full support to the proposals for the European Court of Justice, for which I would specifically like to thank you, Mr Prodi. All or virtually all actions of the European Union must be subject to European law, because only if they are subject to court rulings will European actions be based on law rather than political opportunism. That is why it is so important that most areas of common European action, with very few exceptions, should be based on law and subject to control by the European Court of Justice. Only in that way will we become a genuine community of law. The same should apply to home affairs. I would like to thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for saying that the Greek Presidency will endeavour to achieve a result as regards the Statute for Members of the European Parliament. Mr President-in-Office, if we cannot achieve a result in the Council, then I fear that there will never be a Statute for Members. I think that we have now been wrestling with the issue of the Statute for Members for 15 years, and by finally reaching a decision yesterday, by reaching a decision today, we will have fulfilled our parliamentary obligations. I hope that you will manage to fulfil your own obligations. If you should fail, the Council will bear a great burden of responsibility. I therefore wish you every success in adopting the Statute for Members. I hope that you will also manage to adopt the European party statute, because it is very important indeed for all Europe's party political families, large and small, that we should have a party statute that ensures transparency and an ability to act, and I would very much encourage you to take this to heart. In conclusion I would like to make a comment about foreign policy, which will have a major role to play. Yesterday we had the President of Algeria, Mr Bouteflika, here with us. These days we naturally tend to look towards Eastern Europe. This weekend, this Saturday and Sunday, we are encouraging our Polish partners to vote ‘Yes’ to Europe in their referendum, to say ‘Yes’ to membership of the European Union. I had a wonderful experience last Sunday in Warsaw during a pro-accession demonstration, when we were shouting out: Tak dla Polski!
 ‘Yes’ for Polish membership of the European Union! It is now time, however, not only to look towards the east, but also towards the south, towards the Mediterranean area. We should really be injecting some substance into the Mediterranean dialogue, because up to now it has largely consisted of rhetoric. We should not lose sight of the Mediterranean area, because if we are concerned about border security – and we need to be, both in relation to countries in the east as well as countries in the south – we do not want to erect a new wall. No, we need to help the countries of the Mediterranean area, in North Africa, so that people there, and particularly young people, have opportunities in life. That is why we need to redouble our efforts. I wish you every success at the Thessaloniki Summit. If you take this decision, you will have my group's support. I wish you, the Greek Presidency and all of us in the European Union good luck! (Applause

 Mr President, I wish to raise another matter, although I leave it to your wise judgement as to whether, if it gains majority support in this House, it should be dealt with on Wednesday or during the short sitting on Thursday. I refer to the need for information from the Commission concerning the events surrounding Eurostat. These cases of fraud – which I will describe as matters of suspicion – have not yet been considered by the Members of this House, although they are receiving blanket coverage in Europe’s media. Our group requests that we should have a communication from the Commission, on the basis of which we could discuss the Eurostat problem, either on Wednesday, or during the short sitting on Thursday. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having considered this matter, our group supports this proposal. We would very much have appreciated it if the resolution of the Conference of Presidents, which was – as I recall it – unanimous, could have been acted on this week, and if the Chairman of the Convention could have visited Parliament this week. I do not know why this has not been done. The reasons for this remain to be clarified, but I would very much welcome it if the Chairman of the Convention were to join us for our short sitting.

 Mr President, let me just reiterate the point that, as I recall it, the Conference of Presidents resolved unanimously – something it very rarely does – to ask the Chairman of the Convention to join us for this part-session. I do not know whether an official summons or invitation was issued, or whether it was declined. That may well be the case, but I would like clarification – which we are not going to get right now – as to whether, if the Conference of Presidents’ resolution was unanimous, that resolution was implemented as regards our procedure, and I would be obliged if we could be given more precise information on the subject on Thursday morning. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Tuesday night some 90 people died in a brutal terrorist attack in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The victims included both Saudis and Europeans – as far as we know, French, British, German, one Swiss – and Australians. This shows once again that the challenges posed by terrorism do not just affect the Americans, they affect us all, and the lesson we should learn from this appalling terrorist attack in Riyadh should be that we need to join together to fight terrorism resolutely throughout the world. The President-in-Office was right to refer to Chechnya. The European Parliament – well my group at least, but I think this also applies to the other groups – will be considering very carefully what further progress can be made towards a peaceful solution in Chechnya. Following the Iraq war, we Europeans need to decide what lessons we can learn from experiences which have been painful for Europe as well, and we must make it clear that there is no cause for defeatism. During this unhappy period of lack of European unity I have often heard it said this makes nonsense of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. No, we must treat this crisis as an opportunity to be seized and make sure that in future we do better than with the Iraq crisis and the Iraq war. Above all, we need to make sure that before one Member State or a number of Member States adopt a national position and then go public, we should discuss our respective standpoints within the European Union so that we can arrive at a common position. (Applause)
 This demand is also aimed at the two European members of the United Nations Security Council. The Maastricht Treaty already stipulates that before Member States who are members of the Security Council vote, they should first consult with their partners in the European Union, and that is the lesson we should learn from the past few weeks. I would also like to add – and this concerns our relations with the United States – that those people who think that a united Europe should be created in opposition to the United States are on shaky ground, because if we build up Europe in opposition to the United States, then at least half, if not more, of all Europeans would turn their back on a united Europe, so there is in fact no alternative to creating a Europe that does not oppose the United States, but is an equal partner of the USA. Let me add a further point. One voice in America suggested that Europe could be divided into New Europe and Old Europe. On a recent visit to Warsaw I realised that they are not happy with that suggestion there. Warsaw – Poland – is part of the Old Europe and shares our roots, and we should not allow anyone to divide Europe into two halves. No, it is up to us to act in unison. Now let me turn to Iraq. We are bound to have a strong interest in civil order being swiftly re-established, and when we are talking about the relationship between the European Union and the Arab Islamic states we often say that there cannot and must not be any clash of civilisation, and the same of course applies to order in Iraq. Iraq’s population includes Shiites, Sunnis and Christians, Arabs and Kurds, and I believe that one area where we really may be able to help – and if we can help, then we should – is to ensure that peace and order prevail in Iraq, and that there is no conflict between the various religious or ethnic groups. I believe that the European Union has an important role to play here, and on behalf of my group I welcome the fact that you have been to Iraq, Commissioner Nielson. It is of course very difficult to say at this point here in the European Parliament whether the United Nations is to be given an exclusive role, and what role we as the European Union and others are to play – NATO perhaps, and the United States and the United Kingdom as the two powers that intervened there. That is hard to say, but what we can say is that we call on everyone involved there – and particularly the Europeans, including our Polish partners and friends – for we Europeans to take whatever action we take in concert, once we have agreed on a common position. There are enormous humanitarian challenges in Iraq, and I believe that we can make a contribution to security there, to the establishment of a police force, to water supply, to healthcare and to a new political order in general. In conclusion, let me say this: we do of course have questions for our American friends and partners. So far, no weapons of mass destruction have been found. I recommend that the search for them should be continued, as that was the basis for intervention, and its political credibility is dependent on that, which is why we need to take that question very seriously indeed. (Applause)
 What we need to achieve now is a peaceful solution in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, and that was indeed our great hope following the Kuwait crisis in 1991, when I was very much in favour of the liberation of Kuwait and the firm action against Saddam Hussein that it involved. We must seize this opportunity now. The credibility of our policy will also depend on our success in achieving a peaceful solution there, and I call on all of us to make a united and decisive contribution as Europeans. (Applause)

 Thank you, Mr President, for handling matters in this way. Let me say this in all seriousness to all the staff and officials of this House: where your legitimate interests are at stake, we are on your side, but do not use this historic day, when the admission of ten countries to the European Union is at stake, as the occasion for enforcing interests that may or may not be legitimate. We have to do proper work today, we have to vote, and I ask you to discharge your great responsibility so that we may be able to do our duty. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous and historic day, a day of great joy and of profound gratitude. Let me speak personally; it is my privilege to have been a Member of this Parliament since 1979. If, when Parliament was first directly elected, someone had told me: ‘On 9 April 2003, you will decide whether the three Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Warsaw Pact states Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia, and then also Malta and Cyprus, will join the European Union’, I would have said in reply, ‘That is a tremendous dream, that is a fantastic vision.’ Yet this dream, this vision, is now becoming reality, and let us be deeply grateful for it and rejoice! (Applause)
 We also think back over Europe's history, for we cannot shape the future unless we know the past. Our thoughts go back to the terrible, criminal years of National Socialism from 1933 to 1945. We think back to 17 June 1953, to the Soviet tanks in Budapest in 1956 and in Prague in 1968, and cast our minds back to the great freedom movements of the 1980s, remembering Solidarity, the popular desire for freedom in Central and Eastern Europe, and 9 November 1989, the day when the wall came down. Robert Schuman – whose name our Chamber bears – said, as long ago as the 1960s: ‘One day, all Europeans will belong to the European Community, to the European Union, in freedom and in peace.’ Our group has always had that as its objective. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all those who have played their part in this, above all to Mr Brok for his work as rapporteur, but also to the Committee on Budgets' rapporteurs, Mr Böge and Mr Colom i Naval, and also to all in the Commission, whom you, Commissioner Verheugen, represent. The candidate countries can now look back on the massive efforts they have accomplished, but there are still more massive efforts ahead of them. Above all else, we must bring Europe together and reconcile it, both morally and intellectually. It is for that reason that we would have very much welcomed it if the Czech Government under their great President Vaclav Havel and his successor Vaclav Klaus, had had the strength and the courage to utter even one word of regret and sorrow about the people who were expelled. We have to use truth to bring about reconciliation, and now we all have to look to the future together. To those who believe that our European home is not yet finished and that they should therefore not give their approval to enlargement, I say this: we have succeeded in bringing the Convention into being, and we will work hard to get us a European constitution soon, and to set all Europeans on their shared journey into the future on the basis of law. A quite overwhelming majority in our group – it is almost unanimous – says ‘yes’ to every one of these countries, bidding them welcome to the European Union, to our community of values. Let us, together, take into the future this old Europe, which keeps on renewing itself! That is what we want for our continent. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with a word of thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency of the Council, and also, Mr Simitis, to you personally. This time of grave crisis is one in which, rather than dividing Europe, it needs to be brought together, and it is evident that that is what is in your mind. As this Europe of ours does not belong to any one party family alone, but is our common possession, what I desire for you and for us all, gathered here, is that, in the remaining weeks of your Presidency, you will be successful in guiding this European Union in the right direction for the future! (Applause from the right)
 At this time, we think of the coalition troops in Iraq, some 30 000 of them from a Member State of the European Union. Human dignity being indivisible, though, we think also of the Iraqi soldiers who are being misused by a criminal regime. I hope that what was so well expressed in the Conclusions of the summit here in Brussels will indeed come to pass, and that all Iraqis will very soon be allowed to live in freedom, dignity and prosperity under a representative government that will be at peace with its neighbours and an active member of the international community. That must be our objective, and we Europeans must not opt out at this stage but, together, united and with determination, must make our own effective contribution to giving peace in the Middle East a chance. Although there are differences of opinion in our group, as there were before the war, the great majority of us take the view that there is one thing we should be saying to our American friends. It is that, whilst international institutions such as the United Nations, NATO, and, of course, this integrated European structure, the European Union, may have their faults, because they are manned by human beings, we do agree that they have a vision for the future, and, no matter what the imperfections of these structures of peace, we will not allow anyone to jeopardise these institutions, the basis of whose existence is beyond question! Richard Perle has said that both the UN and NATO had lost their contemporary relevance and were meaningless in the twenty-first century. I would like to respond to that by saying that, if we ourselves put a question mark against the North Atlantic Alliance, what are we actually saying to the peoples of central Europe, to the Poles, and to the Slovenes, who have just held their referendum? That is where they are seeking security in the face of threats! That is why we have to give some thought to how to improve these institutions, but we must not question their existence. (Applause from the right)
 We do, of course, need proper trans-Atlantic relations and a trans-Atlantic partnership. Nobody is in any doubt about my position on the Iraq issue, and that is why I tell our American friends that the European Union is also in the American interest. Americans should not see relations with Europe solely in terms of relations between the USA and France, the USA and Great Britain, the USA and Germany, the USA and Greece, the USA and all the others. We will soon be meeting them again in the forum of the World Trade Organisation, where the European Union must – and will – present a united front. Hence my plea to our American friends that they take the European Union seriously. It is our way of strengthening our influence in the world; it is our way of living at peace with one another and maintaining good, well-ordered, relations with the United States of America on the basis of partnership! (Applause from the right)
 The President of the Commission has praised the Belgian initiative on defence policy. I spent ten years as chairman of this Parliament's security and disarmament sub-committee, so I know what I am talking about when I say that I very much support what they are trying to do, but am not sure that having a meeting of the few here in Belgium is the right way to go about it. We were highly critical when the British Prime Minister sent out invitations to dinner at No 10 Downing Street, with some being invited and others not. If that sort of thing catches on even in the Benelux states, then my great fear is that we will end up with new communities forming in the south, in the east, in the west, communities of Social Democrats, communities of Christian Democrats, some of them overlapping. We must make use of the Community institutions and work together in them! (Applause from the right)
 Let me make a few comments on the Lisbon process; while I am grateful to the President of the European Council for mentioning this topic, we have for some time regarded as excessively bombastic the statement that we are to become a best economic area in the world. It always reminds us a bit of Nikita Khrushchev, who, in the 1960s, always wanted to overtake the USA, and we know what the result was! The goal is the right one, but what now matters is that the instruments be brought into play, and this is where a number of Member States are not doing what has to be done. I would have liked more to have been said about monetary stability. A lot is being said about the Stability Pact's flexibility. Let us just consider what the Euro is worth to us today. Let us imagine what things would be like if it did not exist – how then would our currencies be valued in relation to each other today? It is for that reason that we must defend the common European currency, and we need it to be a stable one. What is of pre-eminent importance is globalisation, which is often decried – sometimes rightly, sometimes wrongly. Big businesses are able to seek out for themselves a business location where taxes are at their lowest, which small and medium-sized enterprises cannot do. It follows that structural reforms must be of such a nature as to enable small and medium-sized firms to invest, taxes to be cut and jobs to be thereby created. This is where governments must take some action at last! Please allow me to make two comments by way of conclusion. I hope that a statute for European political parties will come about before the end of the Greek Presidency, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I urge you to ensure that we achieve a result on the issue of the financial package with the prospect of enlargement. We will not accept any curtailment of Parliament's rights as regards the Budget, but nor do we want to delay enlargement; we want to keep to the timetable. We wish you success in your efforts to do this. To the President of the Commission, too, I make the plea that we should now do everything possible to maintain Parliament's rights and prevent discrimination against the candidate countries. For these things we will continue to campaign, and we ask that you put them into practice. Then, success will be ours under the Greek Presidency of the Council, a success that I wish, not only for you, but also for us all, and from the bottom of my heart. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when issues of war and peace are at stake, they have a profound effect on us – on our minds, our intellects, our hearts and our emotions. What I ask of all of us is that we conduct this difficult debate with an attitude of mutual respect, taking the approach that – even when our opinions differ – we are all men and women of goodwill. The reason why I say this with such emphasis is that, here in the European Parliament, when fundamental issues concerning Europe's future were at stake, we have always eventually managed to reach a common position. While there is dispute concerning the crisis in Iraq, we must not allow ourselves to be divided on fundamental issues here in this European Parliament; on the contrary, where those fundamental issues are concerned, the road into the future is one on which we must journey together. (Applause from the right)
 Ladies and gentlemen, when we, in our present situation, consider what is happening tonight, we have to get to the root causes of it. Let me repeat: what is happening tonight, and what will be happening over the coming days and weeks, would not be happening were it not for Saddam Hussein's criminal regime, with its torture, its secret service, its murders and assassinations. It is Saddam Hussein who is responsible for the developments that are going on around us. (Applause from the right)
 We regret the fact that the UN Security Council was not able to agree on the attitude to take to the disarmament of Iraq. (Interruption: And why was that?)
 We really do regret that most deeply. Pope John Paul II ... (Heckling)
 Yes, he is indeed, on this issue, closer to some than to those who would criticise me for quoting him – Pope John Paul II has said through his spokesman: ‘Those who decide that all peaceful means made available by international law are exhausted assume a grave responsibility before God, before their conscience, and before history.’ The American President, George Bush – having had the experience of 11 September, which, in terms of American psychology, means that America is at war – does indeed assume that responsibility, and, above all, assumes it together with others. President Bush has said tonight: ‘We have no ambition in Iraq except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people.’ If this is to be the objective, then our group is right behind him; this is something about which one cannot be neutral. (Applause from the right)
 Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cause for anti-Americanism. Although I am speaking here as a European, that is something I can say as a German. We would have wanted action to be taken via the United Nations, but at a time when we face the threat of anti-Americanism, we must not forget that it was the Americans who liberated the people who remained in the Nazi’s concentration camps. (Applause from the right)
 Today, we recall how it was an American President, Ronald Reagan, who, in the mid-Eighties, said: ‘Mr. Gorbachev, break the wall down!’ – and was patronised for it. At the time, that struck many people as ridiculous, as a mirage, yet without the Americans – and of course without Gorbachev – this transformation in Europe would not have been possible. It is that that we must remember today. (Applause from the right)
 I can tell you, though, ladies and gentlemen, in all seriousness, there is much about a global power such as America that is worthy of criticism, and there is much, too, with which we do not agree. We would not think it right for there to be only one great power left in the world, with the others no longer capable of bringing any influence to bear. That is why, in these difficult hours, what is required of us Europeans ourselves is that we criticise the Americans less, but ask ourselves, as Europeans, more what we can do in order to be united, strong and capable of influencing our American friends. That is the responsibility that we ourselves bear today. (Applause from the right)
 I unreservedly endorse what Mr Papandreou and Commissioner Patten have said, that we must now urge our American friends not to let a peace settlement in the Middle East be only a matter of words. Israel has the right to live within secure borders, but the Palestinian people, too, have the right to live within secure borders, and with dignity, and we – Europeans and Americans together – must now do our part to bring that about. (Applause from the right)
 Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by referring to the European Union's great achievement, which is the reason why I appeal for us not to allow ourselves to be divided, whatever our disagreements about the matter in hand. This Europe, this European Union, lives in peace today because, in our European Union, it is the law that holds sway, and not the law of the strong. Let us in future do everything possible to prevent axes from being again established between capitals, with one city ranged against the other; instead, we Europeans must act as a Community. That is what we must require of ourselves at the present time. (Applause from the right)

 Mr President, we rejoice at the presence among us today of the President-in-Office of the Council, and hope that we will be able to rejoice in welcoming him here on many more occasions during the Greek Presidency. Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, when issues of war and peace are at stake, we conduct our debates not only with our minds, but also, self-evidently, with all the passion we have, and must work on the assumption that we will, eventually, avert the threat and, it is to be hoped, secure peace at the same time. We must introduce our analysis of the situation by describing the actual facts in clear terms. We would not be having this debate, and the Security Council would not be giving its attention to the same issue that we are discussing, were it not for Saddam Hussein's criminal regime in Baghdad. We have to declare in explicit language that Saddam Hussein's regime depends for its existence upon a secret service, upon violence, murder and terror. I am very much in agreement with the President-in-Office of the Council when he says that our goal must be Iraq's complete disarmament. My dear friends, before we fix our gaze on America – about which I will be saying something in a moment – and before we criticise the Americans, the first point we have to make is that Saddam Hussein must disarm completely. That is at the heart of the problem. (Applause)
 Ladies and gentlemen, let us now take a look at America. It is with great disquiet that I see America put in the dock – around the world, not just in Europe – and so what I ask of us all is that we discuss these things in a right and proper way with our American partners and friends. I remember very well our debate in Brussels on the day after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. Let us remind ourselves of those hours on 11 September 2001, those few hours in which it seemed as if the nerve centre of the USA – not only the Pentagon, but also the White House and the Capitol – might be hit, in which event the United States would have been incapacitated. It is because such a thing would have been a vision of horror that we say that it is a good thing that the United States of America exists. We are America's friends and partners. That is true of our group. (Applause)
 It is because of this as much as because we acknowledge America's great historic achievements – in the face of the twentieth century's National Socialism and Communism – that I ask that, when talking about America today, we be constantly aware that America is a democracy, and that the Americans have always resolved difficult situations by their own democratic means. The same will be true now. Let us also remind ourselves that, although Saddam Hussein is now starting to disarm, to start ridding himself of weapons he has always maintained he did not even possess, such as the El-Samud 2 rockets, perhaps the nerve gas and the anthrax pathogens, he is willing to progressively dispose of these weapons only because there are 260 000 American soldiers in the region. It would be a great achievement for President George W. Bush if the presence of these troops were to succeed – by peaceful means – in bringing about Iraq's total disarmament. (Applause)
 This is something we have to make utterly clear. Whilst there will of course be differences of opinion on an issue as important as this one, I speak for the whole of my group when I say that we are united in the belief that our moral strength lies in the respect we accord to the law. So, just as Commissioner Patten and Mr Papandreou have done, we declare that any eventual action against Iraq must be taken by the international community and under international law. It is for that reason that we hope that the United Nations will succeed in using peaceful means to steer Iraq towards disarmament. Now it is time for us Europeans to look at ourselves. We always make a big thing of criticising America, but it is not that there is too much of America – there is not enough of Europe. Where Iraq is the issue, it is not a good sign when one government after the other goes its own way without consulting with the others beforehand. (Applause)
 Right now, I do not want to criticise individual governments, but Europe's underlying bane is that everyone thinks they have to go their own way in isolation from everyone else. If we carry on like that, we will not get anywhere in the world, nor will we be able to influence our American friends, but will have to ask ourselves how we Europeans can become capable of contending for our values on the world stage, as the President-in-Office of the Council very rightly said. Let me just make two additional observations. We must endeavour by all peaceful means to prevent this confrontation with Iraq's criminal regime from becoming a confrontation with the Arab world. Mr President, I would be very much in favour of an invitation to President Bouteflika of Algeria or to President Mubarak of Egypt to address plenary being sent out as soon as possible, for this would enable us to express our desire for partnership and – if at all possible – friendship with the Islamic and Arab world. We welcome the visit to Algeria by the French President, which has met with great success. He has stated that we have to step up the Mediterranean dialogue, and I hope for all our sakes that we can ensure that these words are not only that, but that they will be followed up by actions – actions not only in terms of political cooperation, but also in the sense of helping the countries of North Africa to help themselves, thus giving their people a future and preventing them from being led astray into violence of whatever kind. Partnership and friendship with the Arab world! Let me conclude by saying that Israel has a new government. What we ask of Prime Minister Sharon is that he should now use his power to draw one step closer to the Palestinians in order to achieve a genuine peace settlement, with the State of Israel within secure borders, as well as a Palestinian state in which Palestinians can live with dignity. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, if we redouble our efforts towards this end – which will involve common action rather than each country of the European Union going its own way – we will be able, on the global stage, to achieve something for our values of freedom, democracy, and peace. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I always admire the commitment that the esteemed Mr Cohn-Bendit brings to what he has to say here, I have to ask that we stick to logic and bear in mind the way this issue has historically developed in this House. After all, Wednesday's debate, which will be a thorough one, will not be the first we have had on the terrible way the Iraq crisis is developing, and our group has always taken a stand in favour of action within the bounds set by the international community. I say this so that this may not be in doubt. Mr Cohn-Bendit, though, knows as well as any other Member of this House that we voted on this in December. There is now no occasion for us to have a new vote every time we meet here in order to introduce new emphases; on the contrary, Parliament's position is unambiguous, as is that of our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, and I believe that the other groups – most of them, at any rate – want this House's position, once decided upon, to be binding, and for us not to have to make much ado about exchanging views every time. On Wednesday, everyone will have the opportunity to give an opinion, and I recommend that we do so with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that this crisis merits. That is why we oppose a new resolution. (Applause)

 Mr President, on behalf of our group, I wish to make a declaration of vote on the Caveri report. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regrets the fact that, eight years after Austria's accession to the European Union, no solution satisfactory to all parties – on economic as much as on ecological grounds – has yet been found to the problem of goods transport through the Austrian Alps. In the hope of a speedy solution and of greater planning security, acknowledging the positive efforts of the Danish and Greek Council presidencies, we call upon the Council to act upon the mandate of the Laeken and Copenhagen European Councils by promptly presenting a Common Position that will speed up the decision-making process involved in the joint enactment by the Council and Parliament of a solution accepted by all the parties involved. I wish to thank the interpreters for their excellent translation of what was far from being a straightforward text.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance face the prospect of their unity being shattered. Even though Europe is a sad sight to behold, there is an opportunity in every crisis, and so we should not be saying that a common European foreign and security policy makes no sense, or that it has failed; rather, we have to redouble our efforts in order that our foreign and security policy may indeed be shared by all of us. Any such policy must be founded on clear analysis, that analysis being that it is Saddam Hussein who is the problem, at the head of a regime of terror founded upon crime, terror and murder. Commissioner, Iraq is in fact a rich country, but its dictator has plundered it. So anyone who sees the USA as the problem is confusing cause and effect. It is the Iraqi dictator who is the problem. (Applause)
 Our group is of the very decided opinion that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein are a menace to the region and imperil the peace of the world. It is under the UN's aegis that disarmament must take place; it must be peaceful if at all possible, and, if that proves impossible, military means must be employed. Responsibility for whether it happens peacefully or by military force lies solely with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. (Applause)
 Let us just remind ourselves of the chronology of events. At the heart of disunity within Europe and across the Atlantic is the self-isolation of the Federal Republic of Germany, for which its present Chancellor must bear responsibility. (Applause from the right, heckling)
 The German Federal Chancellor, by isolating Germany – whatever reasons he may have had for doing so – during a federal election campaign, in which he said, ‘No matter what the UN does, we will never take part in it!’, took the pressure off Saddam Hussein; he acted in an anti-European way, for one needs to speak first to the Europeans before coming out with utterances with such implications at public election rallies. He gave a complete repeat performance in the elections to provincial assemblies, but it brought him no success in terms of votes. We then come to the second chronological element, the Franco-German declaration at the celebrations of the Elysée Treaty. Speaking in terms of political psychology – and I do so for the benefit of our French friends in particular – this gave the false impression of the French position now being identical to the German one. The French were always much more sophisticated, but that was the political impression that was given. Then came the statement by the eight states. I am speaking for our group when I tell you that we regret this way of going about things, which bypasses the Community process, and that we cannot endorse it. In essence, the statement does meet with our approval, however. It was also necessary in order that we might send out a signal of friendship to our American partners. (Applause from the centre and from the right)
 We are now faced with the question of what is to happen next. I recommend that we give thought to how we understand our relationship with America. If we understand European unity in terms of opposition to the United States of America, then we are building Europe upon sand. Rather than that, we want a partnership between the European Union and the United States of America, a partnership founded on cooperation between equals and on multilateral partnership. There are also, of course, things that we demand of our American partners. We do not think it right that the American administration under President Bush tends to see the USA's relationship with Europe in bilateral terms, in other words, Washington and Paris, Washington and London, Washington and Rome, Washington and Madrid, Washington and Berlin and so on. We have to define the relationship between the USA and Europe in such a way that Europeans can take common action and also in such a way that the European institutions are the American administration's partner in negotiations. (Applause)
 For if we do not build this partnership of equals with America, that also goes against America's interests, as we now see, as European disunity has consequences for the North Atlantic Alliance. The American administration and President Bush should also recognise the value of European unity, which is also in the interests of the United States of America. If we in Europe were to revert to forming axes as we once did, then both our group and I would consider this a perilous road to go down. Just imagine – and I will not use the word ‘axis’ – that there were to be, as seems at present to be taking shape, something like two common positions, with Paris, Berlin and Moscow on the one side and London, Rome, Madrid and Washington on the other. If Europe were to present itself thus to the world, it would be a nightmarish sight. That is why we have to act within the framework of the Community. All the things we are doing now have to be done on a Community basis. That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is why our group supports your decision to call a summit meeting of the Heads of State and of Government. Let me say just a word or two on the subject of Turkey. If our Turkish partners ask us to involve them in planning and to supply them with weapons for their defence, I do not believe that we can refuse such a request, such an entreaty. I hope that we will also achieve a result on this issue. (Applause)
 My wish for the Presidency of the Council next Monday is for three things to be achieved: a European common position, the bridging of the deep gulf between us and the United States, and the sending of a signal to the Iraqi dictator that he must disarm. It is to be hoped he will be brought to do this by peaceful means and under the guidance of the United Nations! (Loud applause)

 Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to decide between war and peace, we must conduct our debate with the greatest seriousness, but also with confidence in ourselves. The wisdom of old Europe, this continent of ours, lies in its capacity for repeated renewal, and we should be telling all those who cast doubt on our credentials, that the policy of uniting Europe is the greatest peace movement on the European continent – old, yet ever renewing itself – and that perhaps other regions in the world will find it an example of peaceful coexistence. What I ask, ladies and gentlemen, is that we should respect each other's points of view. It is certain that we will come to different conclusions on one thing or another, but each of us expresses opinions founded on his or her own convictions, and then we have to see to it that we take the right path. It is quite clear to us in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats that we have to make every conceivable effort and attempt to secure world peace and peace in the Middle East – in so far as this is the nub of the problem. That must be our concern; it is that for which we must work, and the United Nations is the framework within which we must do it. Ladies and gentlemen, even if the use of force in the form of warfare may never be more than the last resort, and though our endeavours must be guided by peace, we have to deal with the facts as they are presented to us. What we have to deal with in Iraq is a criminal system under a dictator and tyrant alleged to have weapons of mass destruction at his disposal – and that is the problem. He is a mass murderer and a war criminal, who, as Commissioner Patten has mentioned, has, in particular, used chemical weapons against his own people, against the Kurds. In 1980, he declared war on Iran, and in 1990 he invaded Kuwait. I take a thoroughly critical line on the United States too, but, ladies and gentlemen, if the United States had not, at that time, led the coalition that liberated Kuwait, might this same dictator not have been able to include the other Arab countries in his expansionist designs? That, too, is something we must bear in mind today. His regime uses its secret services to oppress his own people with violence, murder and terror. Ladies and gentlemen, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein and his regime are a menace to the region as a whole and to the international community. Whatever the need to be frank when talking to our American friends, it has to be said that the heart of the problem is not the USA, but Saddam Hussein's criminal regime in Baghdad. (Applause from the centre and the right)
 Ladies, gentlemen, friends, because Iraq, with which we find ourselves dealing in the present situation, is an Arab country, we are also saying loud and clear to the Arab and Muslim world that we want cooperation, we want partnership, and we want friendship – if at all possible – with all Arab and Muslim states, and this must be one of the key fundamentals of European Union policy. I wish to extend warm thanks not only to Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, but also to all those who are working hard in these difficult days and weeks, and I wish to thank the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, for facilitating yesterday's discussion with Hans Blix, from which I learned a very great deal. We agreed that this discussion would be confidential – it could scarcely have taken place had we not done so – but I agree, and our group agrees, that many years have passed since 1990, in which the international community has taken no real action against Saddam Hussein, and so, if we are to achieve the peaceful solution for which we hope, we have to keep up the pressure of recent months, which he is now coming to feel. This has to be a window for peace; it must also mean – and it is to be hoped that it does – that our American partners and friends have not yet decided on military action against Iraq. We have to be open to a truly peaceful solution, which must be reached through the United Nations. Ladies and gentlemen, we must also, however, keep reminding ourselves of the logic involved. The discussion we had with Dr Blix yesterday touched on this. Logic cannot require the inspectors to travel the length and breadth of Iraq to look to see where something might be. It is far more logical for the Iraqi regime to do as Resolution 1441 requires and actually open the gates, so that Dr Blix and his team do not have to virtually grope their way through Iraq with a glimmering lamp. On the contrary, as Mr Solana has said and as is stated in Resolution 1441, what is required is genuinely active cooperation by the regime in Baghdad. That is what we have to insist on, ladies and gentlemen. We hear the President's White House spokesman saying, ‘either he disarms or he will be disarmed’, and so we urge Saddam Hussein to delay no longer in playing his part in this. Let me quote Hans Blix, who said, on one occasion, that ‘it does not, to date, appear that Iraq has really accepted the demand for disarmament’, and on another, that paragraph 9 of Resolution 1441 requires that cooperation be ‘active’. Simply opening doors is not enough. There are questions that Hans Blix has raised, and which we also have to put before the public: what about the anthrax, which is a biological weapon? What became of the 8 500 litres of it? What about the VX, a toxic chemical weapon on which further development work has been done? If Iraq really has disarmed as it claims to have done, it would have been right and proper and in line with international law for this to have been done under UN supervision, as prescribed by the documents and the resolutions. I hope that Iraq will be more cooperative over the coming days and weeks. Ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council of European Union Foreign Ministers decided, quite rightly, to call for complete disarmament, but we have to take the middle way – and everyone knows the difficult position Europeans are in. Our slogan cannot be ‘right or wrong, always America!’ 
That is a road down which we cannot go, but neither can we go down the road of saying that, no matter what Iraq's response may be, the Iraqi dictator will go unpunished, and that we will not play our part! (Applause)
 To do so would be like saying to someone bent upon murder, ‘please don't commit murder, but if you do, there will be no criminal proceedings anyway’. That is why we have to keep up the pressure! What we demand of the US Government is that, if our American partners and friends have intelligence derived from secret service operations, this must also be laid out to public view in the Security Council, so that we may really be in full possession of the facts. People have to be informed, and so we are very decidedly of the opinion that Iraq must dispose of any weapons of mass destruction that it possesses. We want to achieve this through the United Nations, and we want to achieve it by peaceful means! (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, wishes the Greek Presidency every success ... Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: No, I said you were the bourgeois party ...
 Look, whenever Mr Cohn-Bendit butts in, we lose time for debate. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wish you every success, and you will find in us a very fair partner. I want to make it clear that I say this with the agreement of our Greek friends, and Mr Trakatellis will speak immediately after me. We think it is particularly splendid that the treaty with the countries that are to join the EU should be signed, on 16 April, in front of the Acropolis or in its immediate vicinity, that being a symbolic expression of the fact that it is at the site of democracy's foundation, Athens, that we are giving the green light to the membership of the Central European countries that have achieved democracy after the horrors of the Communist era, and before that, the years under National Socialism. Mr President, we are of one mind with you as far as a peaceful solution to Cyprus is concerned, and also as regards the pre-accession strategy for Bulgaria and Romania, and we have an urgent request to make of you in connection with the Balkans. Whilst sharing your belief that these countries must have the prospect of joining the European Union, we must always affirm – and you yourself used the word ‘later’ – the long-term nature of that prospect. For the people of the European Union will first have to cope with the accession of ten countries, to which they will have to adjust, and we may not demand too much of them, nor must we give the impression that the Balkan countries are to be added to them overnight; hence our constant reiteration that this is a long-term process. We wish to strongly encourage you to seize the initiative in relation to the Mediterranean region and the Barcelona process. I am horrified by the sight, repeated week after week, of boats sailing from Morocco in the hope of reaching the Spanish coast, capsizing under stormy conditions, and the people on them being killed. I regard this as unacceptable, and we have to give the countries where these people live a chance of development – not only in the context of immigration policy, but as part of helping the countries of the Mediterranean to help themselves. Governments themselves must also help, of course. Any initiative by you in this area would meet with our full support. Turning to the Convention, Mr Papandreou, as Foreign Minister, will of course be one of its members, and I am sure – and I hope – that we will, if he follows the examples set by others, see and hear much of him in Parliament. Speaking on behalf of the PPE half of our group, I can say that we want a European constitution. We want a European constitution, we want European democracy, we want Europe to have capacity to act, and we want it to be transparent. And such a Europe must rest on the foundations of the Community Europe. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are sure that you support that too. We want the Convention to complete its work by the end of June and to be followed by a brief Intergovernmental Conference, so that the Italian Presidency will find us gaining a constitution for Europe. Let me move on to the Lisbon process. There is much truth in what has been said about this, but, Mr President of the Commission, we agree that we will only get qualified scientists to stay in Europe if we actually manage to reform our tax systems in such a way that it is again worthwhile to make investments, in such a way that Europe is a place where achievement is worth the effort, if we are willing to reform our labour laws and make them more flexible, and if we are able to change our social security systems so that they are characterised by greater self-reliance, so that subsidiarity and solidarity are intertwined. Such a Europe must become more competitive, and so working in it must again be made worth the effort. We need to encourage people to take the initiative, and, above all else, we must not make the citizen promises that the European Union is unable to keep. So let your coordinating efforts be directed towards tax cuts for businesses, reform of the labour market, and reform of our social security systems. There are two important foreign policy issues, Mr President-in-Office of the Council; Iraq is one of them. We must see that weapons of mass destruction are a menace and that, when they threaten us or regions of the globe, those who have them at their disposal, must relinquish them, but what we do and have to do, we do within the framework of the United Nations. We support your efforts towards a common European position on this issue, on the basis of action by the United Nations. It is not acceptable for a European government to say, ‘Leave us out; no matter what the United Nations decide, we're not taking part’, or for another government to give the impression of saying, ‘Whatever happens, we stand alongside the United States’. No, any European policy must be a responsible one, and I would encourage you, and us, to go about it as Europeans, and together. (Applause)
 Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned cooperation with Russia, and in May of this year you will be travelling to a meeting in St Petersburg. Appalling things are currently happening in Chechnya. The Russian Government's unwillingness to extend the OSCE mandate in Chechnya violates the humanitarian principles that we share. I urge you and beg you to raise these things not only when you are in St Petersburg, that beautiful city, which is Russia's window on the world, but make it clear to the Russian Government even before you get there that we expect the OSCE mandate to be extended, that we expect this Parliament's ad hoc delegation to Chechnya, which we have decided on, to actually be allowed to travel to that country. Mr President, I welcome the way you have often encouraged us by referring to our values, but we will gain credibility only if we lay hold of these values not merely for ourselves in this wonderful European Union, which, taking everything into account, is democratic and in a good position both economically and in terms of human rights, but also for the people on our doorstep and throughout the world. That is why we have to speak in a loud voice, and I would encourage you to do just that in St Petersburg. (Applause)

 Mr President, our group has just been discussing this issue, and it is our opinion that the topicality and urgency of developments in North Korea make it imperative that this issue be dealt with this week.

As Mr Barón Crespo has already expressed his opposition to the deletion of Chechnya from the agenda, I will not speak further on the subject. I am very much in favour of our also discussing Chechnya. Speaking on behalf of my group, though, I wish to associate myself with Mr Barón Crespo's proposal that we should – in view of the Liberals' inability to gain a majority on the subject – mandate the President to issue a statement in which, without risking our position being misunderstood, and without the statement being tinged with any sort of anti-Americanism, we express our opposition to capital punishment. Whilst being friendly towards America, we very definitely oppose the death penalty. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my unreserved approval, appreciation and profound gratitude to the Danes for their presidency, which has been a truly excellent one. I would also like to name some names and thank first the President of the European Council, Mr Fogh Rasmussen, and also his Minister for Europe, Bertel Haarder, who was formerly a Member of this House, the deputy prime minister, Ben Bendtsen, who has achieved much for the energy market, and, of course, also the Foreign Minister, Per Stig Møller. I would also like to mention something that is not immediately apparent, namely that my counterpart in the Folketing, 
Mr Knud 
Kirkegaard, working in close consultation with Mr Christian Rovsing and myself, masterminded a conference in Brussels of the group presidents and the national party leaders, at which we too did preparatory work on these Copenhagen issues. It is important that we should build up a network of contacts in the national parliaments, and for this I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to our counterparts in the Danish parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Danish people, as represented by their government, can take pride in what they have done for Europe over the past six months. I hope that the Danish people will demonstrate the same determination when it comes to joining the common European currency, in which respect I wish you, Mr Fogh Rasmussen, much success. (Applause)
 I am no longer speaking for myself alone when I say that your presidency also demonstrates that countries that are not that large – this presidency's great achievements make me disinclined to describe Denmark as a small country – can also do great things. In the current discussions in the Convention, however, where the issue is what we might replace the six-month presidency with, we must be very careful in bearing in mind that the arguments in favour of any change would have to be very good ones, as your presidency is proof – as others have been – that, when a country has the presidency, what it has to contribute is not only ambition, but also commitment to Europe. (Applause)
 Again, if we want any future Secretary-General of the Council to no longer be, at the same time, High Representative – and this is no criticism of Mr Solana, my appreciation for whom I would like to put on the record – but a visible Secretary-General, then I recommend to our colleagues in the Convention that they should give very earnest consideration to these questions. Mr President of the European Council, you spoke about a dream coming true, and we cannot but agree with you entirely. A dream has come true, but this great and historic decision in Copenhagen has also made it clear that the countries that are to join the European Union have already almost achieved normal EU standards. Taking that into consideration – and when it was financial issues that were at stake, we urged you to be flexible – the Poles and the others have almost reached the state of debate with which we are familiar in the European Union of today. One major European newspaper has talked in terms of a terribly nice European family, and that is what Europe is like. We look forward to the day when the treaties are signed, when we will have observers here in Parliament, and when, above all else – in accordance with our group's proposal, which has thankfully been accepted – the 2004 European elections will be the guidance framework for the enlargement process as a whole, and that is how things will now work out. Mr Prodi and Mr Verheugen, I would also, however, like to say a word of heartfelt thanks to the Commission. Rather than everything the Commission does being spectacular, every day is an effort. Copenhagen's success, and its great commitment, was possible only because the Commission, and we in this House, had been supporting the process for many years, and hence we are passionate advocates of the necessity of the Community method being at the heart of the Convention's work, so that the new Europe follows the right method, not only as regards its geographical expansion, but also in core areas. Let me make a comment on Turkey. We would greatly welcome it if Turkey were enabled to meet the political criteria by the autumn of 2004. That would be a gigantic success for both Turkey and Europe, but we are both unequivocal and determined in saying that there must be no political opportunism when deciding whether Turkey fulfils the political criteria, but that decision must be guided by the law. If, following the European elections, we have that responsibility, we will insist that the Commission, represented by its President and by Commissioner Verheugen, shall be strict in ensuring that evaluation is not founded on what is politically desirable, but in fact on the law and the criteria – and I have no doubt that they will do so, this being indeed the greatest challenge to face the present Commission. We will be with them as they go down this road. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are not lacking in solidarity, and I will be quite frank in saying to our American friends that we will always stand alongside the United States of America, but will of course not do it unthinkingly or in ways that are not justifiable. For that reason, though, we will also declare our refusal to be amenable to any pressure from the United States or anywhere else as far as the law is concerned, since the law is the foundation of our European community of values. (Applause)
 Mr President of the European Council, let me make a final comment. Whilst this is not to diminish your work, we would have liked there also to have been a comment on Chechnya in the Copenhagen conclusions. You referred to human rights, and I think it a real duty and obligation upon us not merely to concern ourselves with our own affairs but also to defend human rights in the European Union's geographical environment and around the world. With this in mind, it is my plea that we should respect human rights rather than grovel to anybody. This is a task for us all in the future. Congratulations on what you have done at Copenhagen! You can be proud of what you have achieved, and we have been happy to be your companions on the road. (Applause)

 Mr President, that is something I wish to oppose. As recently as last month, we drafted a resolution on this very important topic, and a form of words relating to this terrible accident was to have been incorporated in the declaration adopted in Copenhagen. We do not consider any further, supplementary resolution on this topic to be appropriate; rather, the whole issue would be given even more weight, in our view, if something were to be framed to form part of the Copenhagen declaration. We therefore oppose the Socialist Group's motion.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we warmly applauded the President of the Commission just now. I am pleased for him personally, but I am also pleased about the case he has been making. We cannot always applaud the President of the Commission so enthusiastically. Mr Prodi, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats wishes to sincerely thank you and the whole Commission for the work you have done. I would also like to add that our group very much supports the Commission as regards the future of the European Union and its institutions. That does not mean that there will not be differences of opinion between us on points of detail, and today's debate is one which forms part of a process in which we need to exchange views, and a process in which others are also involved, such as governments, with whom we ultimately need to achieve a result as well. I believe that the most important thing in the debate over the coming months will be for the Commission and Parliament to ensure in no uncertain terms that the outcome of the Convention is underpinned by the Community method. The Community method means the institutions of the European Union acting together and it particularly means that we must very firmly reject the intergovernmental method. I want to make this point crystal clear, and in the full public gaze: if at the end of the Convention the intergovernmental method wins the day, we could not support that. In that respect, we are totally at one with the Commission. (Applause)
 We want a democratic Europe, and as far as we are concerned a democratic Europe means a representative democracy at EU level. That means the European Parliament being closely involved in all legislative issues, as a 100% co-legislator, as Mr Romano Prodi said. However, a democratic Europe based on representative democracy also means that we recognise the principle of subsidiarity. If we do not want a chamber at EU level consisting of national Members of Parliament, then we also need to strive to define what tasks are European tasks. All other tasks are tasks for the Member States of the European Union and it is the job of the Member States of the European Union to define what are national matters, what are regional matters and what are matters for local authorities. The principle of representative democracy must apply at all four of these levels – local authorities, regions, nations and the European Union. That implies that we need to link the Community method at EU level with the principle of subsidiarity. We need Europe to be effective – let me emphasise that point – and to be clearer and easier to understand. As far as we are concerned, a key issue and one linked with the Community method is that the Europe we are building should be a legal Community. Because if it is not a legal Community it will be an intergovernmental Europe, and that would be opening the way to political opportunism, and history has shown that to be a very bad thing for Europe. It is not possible for me to talk very much about the many points of detail in the four minutes I have at my disposal, but I urge us all to consistently be guided by the issue of method when we have individual decisions to make. My request to the members of the Convention, and let me repeat it here, is this: make sure that the Convention achieves results. If we do not manage to achieve any results in the Convention, and transfer this task to the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of that conference will owe less to the Community method than what we can achieve in the Convention. That is why I am calling for our work in the Convention to be completed and for a willingness to compromise to be demonstrated in that forum, so that by the end of June 2003 we will be able to present a reasonable proposal for a European constitution. (Applause)

 Mr President, you thought you were right to follow the procedure you adopted. On behalf of my group, I would like to say that we did not agree with your decision, but I do not want to dwell on that. I asked to speak because Mr Watson did. However, I certainly cannot accept that anyone – be it a member of my own group or one of the other groups – should take the moral high ground and accuse others of having unworthy intentions! (Loud, prolonged applause, heckling)
 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reaction in this Chamber, the enormous support for what I have just said, is enough. I do not need to add anything else! (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking for your indulgence, as I am going to do something I have never done before and leave the Chamber immediately after my speech. The reason for this is that, contrary to what it had agreed with me, Turkish television has announced that Mr Watson and I will be available for a discussion starting at 5 p.m.. Not wishing to give the wrong political impression, I will go and do it, although I do not otherwise comply with requests of this sort if they have not been agreed in advance. Let us turn, though, to Copenhagen: from Copenhagen to Copenhagen! I wish the summit of Heads of State and Government under Danish presidency great success, in order that we may tackle the issues that remain to be resolved. This summit in Copenhagen must become a summit for enlargement. We must not end up in a situation in which Turkey is the sole topic for discussion. Turkey may well be important, but Copenhagen must send out a signal that the peoples of Central Europe, plus Malta and Cyprus, are joining the community of values that is the European Union. That must stand centre-stage. Copenhagen must consummate the historic process of the 1980s and 1990s, and, to that end, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we wish you much success! I can endorse wholeheartedly what has been said on behalf of the Commission, both by President Prodi and by Commissioner Verheugen, both of whom, as well as the President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to thank for the work they have done. Speaking on behalf of our group, I would also like to remind you that, even if the Danish proposal is accepted, we still have EUR 2.391 billion in hand, on the assumption that the figure, to which Commissioner Verheugen referred, is correct. We should be counting every euro, and, as President Prodi will be aware, I am very much in favour of stability, but the outcome of Copenhagen must not be that the whole enlargement project is deferred for lack of agreement on the financial issues. We therefore call on the governments to achieve a result in Copenhagen. I would think it a tragedy, ladies and gentlemen, if we ended up without an agreement with Poland, a country that was at the heart of change in Europe – I do not want to recapitulate the historical circumstances all over again; I have done it often enough – and if we ended up without an agreement with Poland, the country to which, along with others of course, we owe the great change in Europe. Hence the demand that the Heads of State and Government should do something now and make a result possible. And now for Turkey. Ladies and gentlemen, the European Court of Justice is fifty years old today; at any rate, it was fifty years ago that it was convened for the first time, on 4 December 1952. The law matters to us. There are criteria for accession, and they include such things as the law. We cannot, then, take certain things – all of which are important but have nothing to do with the criteria as such – as reasons for now naming a date for negotiations with Turkey, even though the criteria have in no way been met! We firmly reject the idea that Copenhagen should name a date for negotiations! Ladies and gentlemen, I say this in full awareness of the fact – which I do not conceal and have never sought to conceal – that there are within our group widely divergent views on whether or not Turkey should be a member. Some are very strongly in favour of Turkish membership, while others advocate a strategic or privileged partnership. This is indeed normal in a large group, and I am sure that other groups differ but little. We are not talking only about Turkey, however, when we agree, absolutely and 100%, that it would breach our own requirements and be in contravention of them, if we were now to throw overboard what we have defined as conditions for the commencement of negotiations. What will be the image of the European Union if pressure is exerted over the Cyprus issue, if we are told that, if there is no date right now, the Cyprus issue will not be resolved? We are becoming susceptible to extortion! I therefore recommend that we rely on the firm foundations of European law and criteria. The Commission has pointed us in the right direction; we are not opening any negotiations right now, because the criteria have not been fulfilled, and, on this, our group has no reservations whatever in following the Commission's lead. What I expect of the Council Presidency, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is that you too take your stand on the basis of the criteria and of what has hitherto been agreed in the Community of Fifteen. If you take a different line, our assessment of the Danish Presidency's achievements will be less favourable than it has been so far. Nor do we accept the way in which the United States of America is trying to exert influence; whilst they have the right to bring influence to bear, it is influence and pressure to which we shall not yield! Now, I am also aware that there are countries in the European Union that lag behind others; in particular, that there is a major EU country that needs to make up for lost time in its solidarity with America, and this country is therefore susceptible to pressure. For us, as a friend and partner of America, the pressure of no consequence whatever, as we are following our own principles, and so what we say to our American partners and friends is this: You can make recommendations to us, but we will act in accordance with our own convictions! We now hear from Turkey that the Cyprus issue will not be resolved if they are not given a date. We had a clear basis, to which the President-in-Office of the Council referred: if the Cyprus issue is not resolved within the framework of a federation of both parts of the island, then what had previously been resolved by the European Union will apply, and the whole island – but in reality only its Greek part – will become a member. I have one further comment to make to the Commission on the post-1 May 2004 order. Our recommendation to the Council and to the Commission is that no decision, whether anticipatory or otherwise, should be taken without reference to Parliament. We are prepared to be flexible in any way that will be appropriate, but what you can depend on is that we will always defend Parliament's rights. It is on this basis that we seek good cooperation with all the institutions of the European Union. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group advocates a stronger strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia, because we are convinced that peace in our continent is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain a strong and effective European Union and an effective and democratic Russian Federation. We also recognise the progress that Russia has made in recent years in overcoming the legacy of the Communist era. We are, however, amazed at some of the circumstances surrounding the Brussels Summit. This negative view really needs to be aired here. It concerns both Chechnya and Kaliningrad. With regard to Chechnya, I would like to say that we are constitutional states and Denmark is also a constitutional state. It is the indisputable right of the Chechens to hold a peaceful conference in Copenhagen if it is their wish to do so. I do not wish to criticise the presidency for the fact that the summit ended up being held in Brussels. But I believe that we need to be courageous and not always give in when our partners in talks put pressure on us and demand concessions. On the contrary, we need to stand firm. We are in favour of resolutely fighting terrorism, because terrorism is an obstacle to the peaceful coexistence of peoples. We very much declare war on any form of terrorism. However, we also believe that the war on terrorism should not be deprived of its legitimacy by surrendering human rights in its name. That is why we are demanding that the war on terror should go hand in hand with a global ethic based on human rights. What this means in practice is that the human rights of the Chechen people should not be sacrificed at the altar of the war on terror, necessary though that war may be. I was extremely surprised by what I read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
 of 13 November. Russia's President Putin was reported as having responded to a journalist that ‘if you want to become Islamic radicals and are therefore willing to be circumcised, than I invite you to come to Moscow. We are a country of many different faiths, and we have excellent doctors. We would recommend carrying out the operation in such a way that nothing grows again’. That is typical of the way human rights are breached in Chechnya. I would be very pleased, Mr President, if in future the issue of Chechnya could be addressed in writing in the communiqués issued following these summits. I have not been able to find a single word about this in the communiqué, even though reporters told me that Mr Rasmussen championed this cause, and Commissioner Patten also informed the Committee on Development and Cooperation about this. However, this should also be included in the conclusions of a summit of this kind. Now let me turn to Kaliningrad. I read today in my local paper, the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung
, a well-written article entitled ‘Russia offers little hope. People of Kaliningrad expect much from EU, but little from Moscow.’ I naturally welcome the fact that the thorny issue of visas has been resolved. However, the people in the Kaliningrad region or ‘oblast
’ – and this is the heart of the matter – look far more towards the West than they do towards Russia. Igor Rudnikov, the managing editor of the courageous newspaper Novye Kolyosa
, which means ‘New Wheels’, has said that the rhetoric and fuss issuing from the Russian Federation on the subject of Kaliningrad has only damaged its cause. They look towards the capitals of Europe – to Paris, to Warsaw and to Berlin. The central issue is that the Kaliningrad region should be developed so that it does not become a no-man's-land in Europe, but becomes part of a development axis running through Poland and into the Baltic states. It would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda, so that these human problems can be solved. I would like to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office, and the Commission, to act with this in mind. If you do that, you will have our support too. (Applause)

 Mr President, on a point of order: I was somewhat astonished, at 1 p.m. this lunchtime, to learn of the existence of this application by the Greens. We are a democratic group, in which decisions are never taken by the chairman acting alone. I immediately sent an e-mail to the bureau and to the two co-ordinators, Philippe Morillon and Arie Oostlander, to the effect that we would support this application by the Greens subject to no objection being expressed to me. My dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, I would, however, ask you to ensure that, in future, our groups have the time to discuss such an issue in a democratic manner. In the absence of any objection from the bureau and the co-ordinators, our group is in favour of taking this topic and Mr Solana's statement together. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, seldom can there have been an issue and a resolution of problems on which the Presidency of the Council, the Council of Ministers as a whole, the Commission and we in Parliament can have acted with such unanimity and common purpose. As far as the membership of the central European countries is concerned – theirs especially because of their Communist past, although Malta and Cyprus are also involved – they have earned the right to have this great and historic unanimity demonstrated by us here today. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I was very favourably struck by the way that you put your remarks in this historic context, and I believe that this is what we have to do. I also want to add, however, that Europe will have successfully completed its probation only as and when the outcome of the Convention on a European constitutional treaty is greeted with the same unanimity by the governments, the Commission and by Parliament, so that Europe may, in the twenty-first century, have stable institutional structures, and the Council of Ministers' principal and greatest task will be to support a Community model, so that this enlarged community of twenty-five – and later even more – States will also have a solid foundation. That is what, right now, I urge you to do. (Applause)
 We very much welcome the fact that the way is now open for ten Central European states plus Malta and Cyprus, that the mandate is on the table, and that now the Commission's and the governments' hard work can be continued, enabling us, Mr President-in-Office, to actually achieve that of which you spoke: ‘From Copenhagen to Copenhagen!’ It will also enable you to say, on the 12 and 13 of December: ‘The Treaties are ready for signature.’ That is what I wish you; that is what I wish for all of us for the sake of Europe's future. We wish to encourage Bulgaria and Romania to persevere with their efforts. Our group currently maintains close contacts with both countries, but they have a long distance still to cover. As regards Turkey, I will be quite frank in saying that there are different positions in our group concerning its membership in the European Union, for our group is a very democratic one – Christian Democrats and Conservatives could not be anything else – but I will tell you very clearly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council that there is one thing we do agree on, and that is that we do not believe that the time is right to specify a date for the commencement of negotiations in December and in Copenhagen. Of course we welcome the way that both the parties that have won the elections in Turkey are oriented towards Europe, but we also cannot but take note of a democratic deficit, in that 45% of Turkey's voters are not represented in its parliament at all. Let me remind you that the leader of the Justice and Development Party, Mr Erdogan, cannot become prime minister as he is facing charges that make it impossible for him to be the party's chairman. This is an absurd situation. I would also like to remind you of something that is a matter of European concern, even though it affects my own country, namely that political foundations from the Federal Republic of Germany, not only our own party's, but the ones associated with the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Liberals, are accused of espionage in Turkey. This is an absurd way of going about things, and I ask you to note this as an example of how much more Turkey has to develop. (Applause)
 Mr Schulz, I am delighted that the Social Democrats are showing increasing agreement with what I have to say about Turkey, ... (Interruptions)
 ... and, I hope, also with what I have to say on other subjects. Mr Cohn-Bendit, I will return to the subject of how we took up common positions on the subject of Chechnya, and if our group is in reality to be taken as occupying the middle ground in Parliament on these issues, then that is something that we welcome. We did not understand why it was necessary to put the whole agricultural issue on the table in Brussels. Now, thank God, we have to some extent got things right, but we did not understand why a major Member State of the European Union chose that occasion to put the agriculture issue central stage, and I sometimes get the impression – and Mr Daul and Mr Goepel will have more to say on these points – that we do not actually know what was decided there. I hope that will eventually emerge, so that what was actually decided will be known after the event. I would like to call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Council itself – the Commission, of which we sometimes have criticisms that are not the point at issue today, is on our side in these matters – to involve Parliament in dealing with all the financial consequences for the current financial perspective – on which James Elles is our expert – and also for future financial perspectives, and to do so in such a way that the institutional preparations can be made in this area as well. Turning to Kaliningrad, it is my urgent recommendation, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we do not give Lithuania in particular the impression that we would make concessions to a large European country, one that does not belong to the European Union, on the back of this rather small future Member State, Lithuania. Lithuania's sovereignty is also at stake, and that is something we should always consider. My final point is this: We will shortly be debating Chechnya with Mr Solana. It really is depressing to read in major European newspapers that Sergei Kovalev, President Yeltsin's former representative on human rights, said yesterday in one of them that the barbaric behaviour of the Russian army continues in Chechnya today just as it did a number of years ago. We decisively reject any form of terrorism, even in Moscow, but we may not treat terror and terrorists and the people in Chechnya as one and the same thing! We urge you to have real courage at the summit that is to be held – not, unfortunately, in Copenhagen but in Brussels, because Russia wanted it that way – you may well have given in to pressure, but it is the substance that matters; real courage to find clear language in which to say that we have to negotiate in Chechnya, and that people there have a future within the Russian Federation without losing their identity. What I would like to see here is not only diplomatic talk from the Heads of State and of Government, but also a tough approach to this matter, because we, being a democratic Union, are under the obligation to stand up for human rights in Europe and throughout the world. I wish you much success in this. Quite apart from anything else, the Danish Presidency of the Council has so far done its job extraordinarily well, which also demonstrates that you do not have to be a big country to be a success in Europe.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we unreservedly support the political objectives set out here both by the Council and by the Commission in the persons of President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen, but we must also point out that the European Union is in a very grave situation. What we have heard indicates that the prospects for the summit now being held in Brussels are not very rosy. On behalf of our group, I would again like to make very clear that we had always envisaged a timetable according to which negotiations would be concluded by the end of 2002, with the treaties then being signed in March or April and the accessions formalised in 2004, so that the candidate countries would be able to take part in the 2004 European elections. Now, Commissioner Verheugen has just made reference to Germany and France. I agree on the importance of these two countries coming to an understanding, but, along with our group, I consider it a serious political error now to attach new conditions to the completion of the negotiations out of the desire for a new financial framework for the post-2006 period and perhaps even sooner. Mr Böge, who is an expert on Budget matters, has confirmed to me, and I would like to point out, that Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, and hence the allocation of the funds that enlargement will require between 2004 and 2006, can be decided on only on a proposal from the Commission and by a qualified majority in the Council as well as an absolute majority of members and three-fifths of the votes cast in Parliament. This, then, is where Parliament also has a part to play. I very much hope that an agreement can now successfully be reached in Brussels, as both Mr Haarder and Mr Verheugen have said. For if no success is forthcoming from Brussels, negotiations will be held up. I have to say, speaking for my group, that we regard delaying the negotiations in such a way as irresponsible if it means that they cannot be concluded by the end of this year. That is why the appearance of these new conditions at this juncture is a grave political error. It would have been possible to discuss them at a much earlier stage. It would be a tragedy if the candidate countries were to end up losing out because insufficient agreement had been reached within the European Union. I agree wholeheartedly with what Commissioner Verheugen said about the candidate countries having done their duty over recent years, but it is the fault of certain of our Member States that we in the European Union have failed to do what had to be done. We would be in breach of the trust placed in us by the candidate countries if we were to fail to come to an agreement in Brussels now. I call upon all the parties involved to unite in Brussels and make the task of the Danish Council Presidency easier, enabling us to conclude the negotiations in time for Copenhagen. Reference has been made to public information, and I can emphatically underline what both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have had to say on the subject. Commissioner Verheugen, Parliament also needs to hear what is actually being done with the funds that the Commission has allocated to information work, in order to give better information on the use made of these funds to our voters, whom we of course have to take with us along this road. Mr Haarder also mentioned how Kaliningrad will be a topic of discussion in Brussels. Whatever the necessity of resolving the problems Russia has with transit – and there is no doubt that Russia has a major interest in this – it is important for us that we make sure that Lithuania does not get the impression that we in the European Union are now making decisions over its head. On the contrary, Lithuania must be strengthened in its sense of its own sovereignty, and whatever is eventually decided must, of course, be subject to its agreement. The Schengen criteria must also be adhered to. It is on this basis, and also in relation to security, that we of course counsel flexibility in resolving matters with Russia. The issue, however, is not only access to the Kaliningrad region, for beyond it, of course, lies Greater Russia. There are other problems with borders. Take, for example, the small amount of cross-border traffic between Poland and the Ukraine or that between Slovakia, Hungary and the Ukraine. I urge this House to bear in mind the need to, on the one hand, guarantee security, and, on the other, to use flexible solutions to make it possible for people on either side of the border to meet each other. In Brussels, you will hear a report from Valéry Giscard D’Estaing, the President of the Convention. Our group and also our party – the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – is, as we have now confirmed at our congress, quite clear about the timeframe involved. We want the Convention to produce a result by the end of June 2003, with, after that, a short Intergovernmental Conference, so that, under the Italian Presidency, we may achieve a Treaty of Rome or a constitution of Rome, a basic treaty for the European Union by the end of 2003. This, therefore, is our call to all the parties involved: let us be ambitious, so that we may, adhering to this timeframe, bring into being the historic project, not only of enlargement, but also of a European constitution within the time allotted us. This is our collective duty if our European continent is to have a good future. (Applause)

You have had an incredible fight, with the support of many Members of this House, to all of whom I would like to express my gratitude. I would also like to thank the Irish members of my group and of Fine Gael, which is in Opposition, and whose sense of responsibility to Europe led them to decide unequivocally in favour of a Yes vote.

 Life brings situations about which it is no pleasure to have to speak. Today is one of them. Whilst wishing to place on record my personal regard and fondness for Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, as a person, I have to add that we are dealing here, not with relationships between people, but with the acceptance of responsibility. That is why an overwhelming majority in my group is of the definite opinion that something has happened that must not be allowed to repeat itself in the same way. (Applause)
 Last Friday, the President of the Commission had this to say to Le Monde
:
Poettering (PPE-DE

 – (DE) 
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate since it concerns the greatest challenge facing the European Union, namely the accession of ten countries in a first round of enlargement. I therefore find it especially regrettable that the substance of today's debate was revealed in the European press some days ago, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to ensure that in future, Parliament is informed first, and then the European public. I think this is the right way round if a debate like this is to be meaningful. (Applause)
 Notwithstanding this criticism, however, which is meant very seriously, I would like to say a word of thanks to the Commission: to its President, Romano Prodi, to the Commissioner responsible, Günter Verheugen, but also to the previous Commission under Jacques Santer, together with Commissioner Hans van den Broek, for after all, the present Commission did not start from scratch; it built on the work begun by the Santer Commission. I would like to voice my warm thanks to all concerned for their great work. (Applause)
 We are in broad agreement with the conclusions and also with the listing of the ten countries recommended for accession by the Commission, but there is a massive amount of work ahead of us. The accession countries – as has been stated, and for which we express our great respect – after 50 years of communism, communist mismanagement, communist tyranny and dictatorship, have made massive efforts, and this deserves the greatest credit and our greatest respect. However, there is still a massive amount of work to be done, not only by the accession candidates but also by the European Union itself. I think that what is important now is to ensure that we do not shatter the confidence vested in us by the accession countries. Anyone who now sets new accession conditions for the Central European countries, Malta and Cyprus – for example, by demanding reform of the European agricultural policy first of all – anyone who demands this is sinning against the accession countries, because it undermines their confidence in the European Union and its pledges. This is why we must now honour the confidence vested in us by the accession countries and not impose any new conditions. Poland is without doubt the most important accession country, for its population – almost 39 million – is larger than in the other nine candidate countries. We must also remember today that this great transformation in Europe would not have been possible without Poland, without Solidarity – and let me also say this, lest we forget – without the great intellectual power of the Pole who occupies the papal throne, John Paul II, who told the Polish people: 'Don't be afraid!' This was the basis of Europe's intellectual and political transformation. (Applause from the right)
 We must never forget this! It was also the basis on which Germany could be united twelve years ago. Without Poland, this would not have been possible. We therefore hope that at the negotiations, Poland will be able – also in the coming weeks and months – to master the difficult problems still arising in the accession process, and we support the Commission with its proposals on direct payments. There are several unresolved questions to which we would welcome answers from the Czech Government. What is the Czech Government's position on the question whether, for example, legislation still exists in the Czech Republic which does not treat all persons in the European Union equally? Is there discrimination here? It would be helpful if the Czech Government provided an answer to this question. We hope that Bulgaria and Romania, which are not part of this enlargement round, will continue to make progress so that we can close negotiations with these two countries within a foreseeable timeframe as well. We endorse the Commission's position in declining to give Turkey a date for the start of negotiations. On behalf of our group, I would like to point out that we have divergent views on the issue of Turkish membership of the European Union. It is important to state this clearly, and it is the same in other groups. However, we are united in our view that Turkey is a key strategic partner for us, and that we must always maintain our links with that country in a close and well-functioning partnership. There is the problem with Kaliningrad, and I recommend, as a matter of urgency, that in overcoming this difficult problem, we prioritise the issue of security, and also Lithuania's sovereignty, which we must not call into question. On this basis, flexible arrangements with Russia must be found. I also warn against the creation of a new Iron Curtain, for example between Poland and Ukraine; in the region around Lviv in Poland and in other areas, there are close regional and family ties with Ukraine and we must arrive at flexible arrangements which guarantee security but also enable people to meet. The President of the Commission referred to the Mediterranean region. I have just visited Morocco, and there is great concern there that as a result of enlargement, we Europeans will forget about the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean region is our neighbour just as much as the accession countries in the heart of Europe, and I recommend that we take our cooperation with the Mediterranean as seriously as we take our relations with Eastern Europe. (Applause)
 If twenty years ago, someone had asked: 'We are offering you the chance for Poland and other countries to join the European Union – what are you prepared to pay for this?' We would have been willing to pay any financial price at all, and so I say to you: Let us all be happy that today, the accession of Poland and the other countries to the European Union, to our community of values, to democracy, the rule of law and a social market economy is possible, and let us welcome our colleagues warmly when, as we hope, they are elected to this House at the next European elections in 2004. This is a great day for Europe, for we have a shared and, it is to be hoped, a good future ahead for our European continent. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr Møller, Commissioner Patten, Mr Yiannitsis, ladies and gentlemen, a debate such as today's is an occasion on which to take stock of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, highlighting its positive aspects, whilst not omitting those that merit criticism. I would like first to extend my very warm thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Titley, for the excellent reports that they have produced. (Interruption)
 Mr Swoboda, we can talk about that some other time. I would have had no objections to the two rapporteurs presenting their reports, but that was not my decision, nor do I have any reason to question the President's rulings, so that is not a question for me, and I am therefore not going to comment on it. The positive elements of European foreign policy include a topic that we have not yet mentioned at all, that is, the accession of the central European countries to the European Union. That is, indeed, at present still a foreign policy matter, and when these countries join the European Union, it will be a matter for internal affairs. That we will soon – we hope, by the end of year – be concluding negotiations with what are obviously ten European countries, is in fact a great success story. It is one of the great European political successes. Reference has been made to the Balkans, and that is also a positive development. There, the European Union is playing a positive part in the interests of stability, security and democracy. Afghanistan has been mentioned, and here too Europeans have been active; 13 of the 15 EU States are involved in Afghanistan, whether militarily or in other ways. What is actually astonishing is that, although we – by which I mean the European Union and its Member States – are the greatest donors of funds, this actually goes almost without being noticed. When the Americans donate a million dollars somewhere or other, then the whole world gets to know about it. When we donate a billion euro, I sometimes get the impression that it is the best kept of Europe's state secrets. We have to give some thought to how we can make our public relations work even better. Turning to Iraq, we very much support the American President's efforts to involve the United Nations in this issue, and we call on all Member States of the European Union to take up a common position as Europeans together. We see it as irresponsible for one or more Member States to go their own way. Not only does it do damage to that country's relationship with the United States of America, but it also shows a lack of solidarity with Europeans in the European Union, for we can influence American policy and global politics only if we Europeans act together. We now have to require the Iraqi dictator to open up his country to inspections – the British Government produced an important document on the subject yesterday – and, if these inspections on the ground are not feasible, then it is the Iraqi dictator who, at the end of the day, bears the responsibility if military action has to be taken. I can endorse everything that Commissioner Patten said on the subject of the Middle East. Whilst we remain convinced that the escalation of violence must be halted, and that terrorism by suicide commando must come to an end, Israel's responses are quite disproportionate; the Palestinians, too, have their own dignity. I can, then, only encourage the Council and the Commission to stick to their policy of talking to both sides in reasonable terms. There are others who do not do it in this way, and we have an important part to play, as both sides trust us – one perhaps rather more than the other. We Europeans must cooperate with those whose dignity is being violated. What we are saying, with the utmost clarity, is that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, but the Palestinian people also have the right to live in peace and within secure borders. The representatives of the Palestinian people must also be given opportunities to express their views and suggest sensible ways ahead for the future. Mr Yiannitsis, the deputy defence minister of Greece, was right to point out that there is as yet no agreement between the European Union and NATO on access to the North Atlantic Alliance's planning facilities and military capabilities. We hope that we will soon be able to come to an arrangement, and also call upon our Turkish partners to contribute towards finding a solution. I will conclude by observing that Commissioner Patten referred to the need to improve Europe's foreign, security and defence policy instruments. We hope that the Convention will make important proposals on this, and if the European Union is to be able to act and commit itself as it is in Afghanistan, then effective institutions must be the outward expression of this. Our group will therefore do all in its power to make the Convention a success, for on this will depend to a great extent the European Union's success with its Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy. (Applause)

 Madam President, Mr Møller, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to make two preliminary remarks: firstly, I should like to thank my friend and colleague Arie Oostlander very much for agreeing the motion with the other groups so that tomorrow we will hopefully be able to adopt a broad common position. Secondly, we have got into a bit of a muddle with the timetable here and my group's bureau has been meeting since 5.30 p.m. It is advisable for the group chairman to be in attendance, so I would crave your indulgence if I leave immediately after my speech, something that I have never done before. Why did the international community set up this International Criminal Court? It was set up because the Rome Statute of the Court states that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished. That is precisely our group's position. Our values are human dignity, freedom, democracy and the rule of law and no one has the right, except in self-defence, to kill another person or wound their dignity. This dignity is for everyone, for Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, people of no religious persuasion, people from large and small countries, for all the people on this earth. No individual and no country has the right to escape punishment for crimes which concern the international community as a whole. No one, no person and no State, is above the law. That is why we want the International Criminal Court to be effective and capable of acting, and I very much welcome the clear statements made by both President Møller and Commissioner Patten. We expect all EU Member State governments and parliaments to do all they can to ensure that this International Court is able to work properly and effectively. We call in particular on the accession countries not to enter into any agreements before we have agreed on a common position within the European Union, and I hope very much that on 30 September you will succeed in drafting such a common position. I very much regret the fact that Romania, an accession country, has concluded an agreement without first awaiting the European Union's position. It has not acted in solidarity with the European Union. In conclusion allow me to say this: despite the fact that the motion naturally contains a certain amount of criticism of the United States, this is no reason for us now to adopt an anti-American attitude. This is more an example of a case where our opinions differ, and we should discuss this without by so doing ceasing to be partners and friends of the Americans. In a partnership it is usual for differences of opinion to be expressed and in any case we Europeans should act more in unison. We have more reason to ask ourselves questions than to criticise the Americans. This means that here too European unity is actually already part of the answer. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for this debate here and the debate in the international community is Saddam Hussein's dictatorial and criminal regime. The focus of evil is in Iraq, not in the United States. As both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have already pointed out, Saddam Hussein already has a history of using weapons of mass destruction against his own people and against Iraq's neighbours. He invaded Kuwait. If he is still stockpiling and producing weapons of mass destruction, that is a threat both to the Middle East and to the international community as a whole. Anyone who wants to prevent a war must prevent Saddam Hussein from being able to use biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. The way Saddam Hussein is flouting international law is quite unacceptable. He is obliged to permit unconditional and unfettered checks by UN arms inspectors in Iraq. That is what we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are calling for. Saddam Hussein must comply with the demands of the United Nations. That is why we must maintain pressure on this Iraqi dictator. If we in Europe are not united, he will exploit that. That is why it is unacceptable – and I am saying that very calmly – for the Federal Chancellor of Germany to talk about a German approach to this issue. That will only encourage Saddam Hussein and weaken Europe's unity and solidarity. We in the European Union will only have any influence if we act jointly. There can be only one European approach. America's President Bush has promised the allies close consultation. We call on our American friends to share all the information they have with their European allies. The use of force can only be justified if all other means fail. The United Nations should have a monopoly when it comes to making decisions and taking action. Military means should only be used if all other means fail, but even in that case the following questions need to be answered. The first question is whether the coalition against terror that President Bush so impressively assembled after the events of 11 September will survive. The second question is what the plan for the Middle East is after that. I can only emphatically support what Commissioner Patten said when he told us that we need a peace plan between Israel and Palestine, we need a Palestinian state and an Israeli state that can peacefully coexist. The third question is what the consequences are. What consequences would military action have for our relations with the Arab and Islamic world, with whom we want to coexist in partnership and – if possible – in friendship? I know just how important an answer to this question is at the moment, because I have just visited Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Qatar. These questions need to be answered, and on all of them we need to establish a joint position with the United States. People are also wrestling with these questions in America – it is not as if there is only the position of Vice-President Cheney and the position of the Secretary of Defence, Mr Rumsfeld, there is also the position of the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, the position of the former Secretary of State, James Baker, and that of the former Security Advisor to the President's father, Brent Scowcroft. That is why there is absolutely no reason for anti-Americanism in this debate, because exactly the same debate is going on in America as here in Europe. What is important is for the United States and the European Union ultimately to establish a joint position. I want to request and call upon our American friends to resist the temptation of unilateralism and not to act alone. This does not just relate to Iraq, it also relates to how we deal with the International Criminal Court. I also call on all parties, on all the governments of the European Union, not to take unilateral action, but to follow the lead of the European Union as a whole. I also call on our American friends to consistently act in unison with Europe on other issues, such as Kyoto, just as in the present case with Iraq. I have the impression that our American friends see their relations with Europe more in terms of their bilateral relations with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and other states, than in terms of seeing the European Union as a single entity. President Bush made an important speech to the Bundestag in Berlin. We can agree with nearly everything he said, but he did not mention the concept of the European Union once in that speech! That demonstrates how important it is to strengthen our dialogue with the US Government. I would very much welcome it if in the foreseeable future we could also invite the US President to address this House, because if my memory serves me correctly, the last US President to address the European Parliament was President Reagan in 1986. All these things would help to strengthen our relations with America, with our American partners and friends. We need to step up our dialogue with America. We need to act together to avert the threats posed by Saddam Hussein, and above all we in Europe, the Member States of the European Union, and the European Union itself need to act together and in unison. I say that because if we are not united, Europe cannot hope to have any influence. That is why the top priority is for us to act jointly on the world stage through the European Union.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier and the other representatives of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has experienced one of the most catastrophic floods in its history, and we express our sympathy to the families of those who have died in it. Many people are still missing. Not only in two Member States of the European Union – Austria and Germany – have we seen great destruction and devastation, but also in two candidate countries, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Mr Haarder and Commissioner Barnier – representing the Commission – and also our Parliament's representative, have already had occasion to give expression to the present need for European solidarity. Clearing up the flood damage is primarily, of course, a task for the regions and nations, but the events with which we have had to deal here have has such a dramatic impact that people have looked to Europe to give an expression of solidarity, and so, even though Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, is unable to be here today, I would like to express loud and clear my heartfelt gratitude to him for having been to the disaster zones with other representatives of the Commission, and for having represented the European Union there in a way that was right and fitting. (Applause)
 I attached great importance to this. I have not been to the disaster zones and have only been in telephone contact, but many have told me that Mr Prodi's presence – and the humanity he personally embodied – enabled them for once to perceive the Commission and Europe in a quite new way, and not as the distant bureaucracy they had always thought it to be. His quite personal human presence on the spot meant a very great deal to all of us. I kept in touch with President Prodi during this time and, on behalf of our group, told him – he was, I believe, in the Czech Republic at the time – that I supported him in so far as I could, and assured him that any commitments he might make would have our group's support. I want my expression of thanks to include the whole Commission, including Commissioner Barnier, who has just spoken, Commissioner Fischler, Mrs Schreyer, Mr Verheugen and all who have played their part, but also especially to the Danish Presidency of the Council under Mr Haarder, whose government, in its capacity as the Presidency of the Council, has shown such an open-minded attitude to this matter. We are all of course aware that there is a constant tension between solidarity and subsidiarity, but, in this instance, it is solidarity that has had a challenge thrown down to it. If the follow-up measures are now completed as promptly as they should be – and what the Commissioner has said gladdens my heart – then we have done our duty as the European Union. Before turning to a number of somewhat practical matters, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to those who gave assistance on the ground. Mention of, for example, the fire brigade, often raises a smile in our society, as people think that the things fire-fighters handle are toys. In a situation like this one, though, experience teaches us just how important it is to have a fire brigade, how vital are the soldiers who are deployed in a domestic emergency situation, how important the police are, how important civil defence is. At any rate, I have seen, in Germany, the country from which I come, innumerable young people getting stuck in and giving help, and, at a time when anonymity and egoism often seem to be predominant, it is a good sign that it is young people who manifest this solidarity. Turning now to certain aspects of the emergency aid, on which Mr Ferber will also have something to say, we take the view – admittedly in contrast to the Commission – that EUR 1 billion should be allocated to emergency aid. I would like to express my gratitude to the six groups who agreed on this document – Mr Karas and Mr Ferber did so on our group's behalf – for being willing to come to an understanding about a joint text. Aid for agriculture had already been under discussion, then came the Structural Funds' efficiency reserve, followed of course by the disaster fund that now has to be set up for the future, and there will of course have to be a flexible approach to the rules on competition. Commissioner Monti and the Commission as a whole have committed themselves to this. What people now expect of us – and here I am particularly addressing Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Budgets Committee – is that we now implement all this without delay. If we now hesitate and spend weeks disputing among ourselves, we will be throwing away the goodwill that the European Union, especially in the person of Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission, has garnered. I therefore ask that we act with decisiveness and commitment in setting the follow-up measures in motion. Let me make an observation with only indirect relevance to this issue. Deliberations are in progress on the subject of the Stability Pact. Even in a catastrophic situation such as this one, the Stability Pact must not be jeopardised, for this is an issue of confidence in the European currency, of confidence in the ability of the European Union as a whole to deliver the goods. I therefore urge us all – Commission, Council and Parliament – not to shake the foundations of the Stability Pact, but – to return to the catastrophe – to do our duty by the people who have been hard hit. This European Union of ours will then enjoy far more popular acceptance than we often take to be the case. In this spirit I commend cooperation to all the institutions concerned! (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not disagree on the matter in hand, but we do urge that we go about it in another way. On Wednesday, we will be having a truly wide-ranging and very serious debate on Iraq and other important issues, and our group has made very careful preparation for this not only as regards speaking time but also as regards what is to be said. We therefore propose that it is not this week that we should have the debate on the International Criminal Court, but during the second September part-session. That would in any case still precede 30 September and the Council meeting, so we can have a prior debate concluded by a resolution. There is, then, no disagreement about this, but, when it comes to procedure, we favour the second September part-session here in Strasbourg rather than this week.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all congratulate Mr Rasmussen on his great speech. If you achieve all of this in the course of these six months then you will demonstrate once again that it is not just the large countries that can move Europe forward, but precisely a country like yours, that takes up its duties with great ambitions in mind. On behalf of all of us, I wish Denmark every success! (Applause)
 You talked about going from Copenhagen to Copenhagen and spoke in terms of a single Europe. In your speech I also discerned a certain visionary quality, because you are taking responsibility for the fact that we need to seize this opportunity now to reunite Europe. Copenhagen 1993 meant human dignity; it meant the Rule of Law; it meant democracy, the recognition of minorities and market regulation. Making this a reality ten years on by admitting our central European neighbours as Members is a task of truly historic proportions. I fully agree with you that our aim has to be to admit ten countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and, of course, Cyprus and Malta. It has to be clear, however, that if a country does not meet the conditions, then those that have already fulfilled them must not be forced to wait just because the others have not yet done so. I was very glad to hear you say that there must be no new conditions, and I would ask you to resist any pressure, from whichever country, for our side to impose them. (Applause)
 Let me make it clear on behalf of my group that if the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany is now, for electioneering purposes, to link enlargement to the agricultural issue, then we will reject that in the strongest possible terms. I would encourage you to do likewise and firmly reject this approach. (Applause)
 On 10 July, we will hear Commissioner Fischler give us the results of the mid-term review of agricultural policy. Then we will debate them. You said yourself that there will be an opportunity to make decisions at a later stage. I might also recall – and thereby give you some encouragement, Mr President-in-Office – that this Parliament adopted Mr Böge's report on the financial impact of the enlargement of the European Union on the agricultural policy by a large majority, which means that you have the support of the vast majority of this House for your chosen approach. I should like to make a few comments on Turkey. There is of course a reference to Turkey in the Seville Conclusions. We support all attempts to promote good relations between Turkey and the European Union. However, we think that the Danish Presidency is too early to set a date for the beginning of the negotiations. Turkey needs to undertake further reforms – and we should support it in its efforts to do so – but the time has not yet come to set a date for negotiations. I call on the Turkish Government to withdraw its objections to the armed forces of the European Union and NATO carrying out joint missions. As Europeans we have to be capable of taking action and Turkey must make an appropriate contribution to this. The Danish Presidency spoke at length on openness and transparency. It is of course precisely the Nordic countries – Finland, Sweden, but also and in particular Denmark – who lead the way here. I should like to encourage you to implement what was decided in Seville under your presidency. If, for example, the Seville Conclusions state that proposals should be negotiated in public at the beginning and end of the legislative procedure in the Council of Ministers, then you should define the beginning and end of the negotiations as flexibly as possible, so that there is only a short period in the middle when meetings are perhaps not public. We need openness; we need transparency. Access also needs to be given to the television cameras, so that we reach the public at large. In accordance with the Seville Conclusions, before the end of 2002 we will have an interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking. We hope that we will also see results at the political level by the end of 2002. We should also like an agreement – similar to the one that we have on the Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy – on the third pillar, that is Justice and Home Affairs, so that we create more transparency there too. Mr President-in-Office, I should like to thank you for what you have said. In the hope that you will be able to make it a reality, I wish the Danish Presidency every success. The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats stands at your side. Seeing Bertel Haarder, a respected former member of this House, sitting on your right, I am confident that you and your team will also be able to lead the Danish Presidency to a successful conclusion. All our good wishes for the Danish Presidency! (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by recommending that we conduct this debate as we have always done over many years, without allowing it to be interrupted by utterances that are inappropriate at a time such as this. Mr President, I wish, on behalf of our group, to warmly thank the Spanish Presidency and extend my congratulations on a successful term of office, sentiments already expressed by the vigorous applause from the whole House. Mr Aznar, you have come to Parliament on three occasions, thus setting an example to other presidencies, and one that I hope they will follow. A free society can endure only if we determinedly resist every form of terrorism, and you demonstrated exemplary commitment to doing this in the face of ETA terrorism in Spain long before 11 September 2001. On behalf of our group, I would like to tell you that we are ready, willing and alongside you in the defence of freedom and democracy against terrorism. (Applause)
 As you have said, Mr President, you have covered important ground on asylum and immigration policy. We are in favour of our making our borders secure, and we also advocate that border patrols be integrated on European lines, but, as you also said, it is important that we deal firmly with the causes of immigration and counteract them, and the Valencia conference played an important part in building up the Mediterranean dialogue. We in the PPE-DE group are firmly convinced that our relations with the Arab and Islamic world need to be put on a firmer footing. We must not allow ourselves to treat terrorism and the Arab and Islamic world as if they were one and the same thing, and should do everything possible, in North Africa in particular, to create a society in which conditions are such that young people do not emigrate, but have a future in their own homeland. Mr President Aznar, both you and Commission President Prodi spoke about the enlargement of the European Union. I wish to thank you for your active involvement, as a representative of the southern part of the European Union, in the issue of the accession of the countries of Central Europe, and also of course Cyprus and Malta. My group has expressly mandated me to state that we consider it irresponsible for a head of government, in this case the German Federal Chancellor, to make enlargement conditional on the results achieved in negotiations on the agriculture chapter with regard to payments. We consider this irresponsible because it does damage to confidence in the European Union in the candidate countries, the end result being that anti-European feeling in these countries is intensified. We therefore urge you and request you... (Interruption)
 ... no, you do not like hearing that said, but I am telling the truth, and if you were to criticise that, my dear sir, you would make yourself rather more credible than you do by interrupting! (Applause)
 Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you have also committed yourself to contending for the Stability Pact, and we will also say here that it is on stability that confidence in the common European currency is founded. Whether the country concerned is large or small, any violation by it of the Stability and Growth Pact must mean that a warning letter is actually sent and received, and I call on us all to defend the stability of the European currency. You spoke about the Convention. I strongly welcome that, and we advocate Community solutions to be worked out by the Convention. It has been possible, under the Spanish Presidency, to take a great step forward with the Interinstitutional Agreement on Foreign, Security and Defence Policy, yet there are now rumours to the effect that the General Secretariat of the Council is absolutely unwilling to classify certain documents. I hope this will not result in our ending up being denied documents, but rather that what has been agreed will actually be delivered, as the Spanish Presidency has managed to do. We have a great deal of faith in the expected Interinstitutional Agreement, the conclusion of which is being worked on at a high level, not only by experts, but also by politicians, in order to bring about genuinely better lawmaking in the European Union. Mr Aznar, I wish to conclude by congratulating you on the reform of the Council, which is going in the right direction; I believe it is on this basis that we should carry on working in the future. On behalf of our group, I thank you for a successful presidency, and we have confidence in the Spanish government and in Spain's Prime Minister that under the Danish Presidency we will be able to continue along the road on which we have travelled for the past six months. In this spirit, I wish you and all of us great success for the next six months in this European Union in which we share. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the Spanish Presidency has done a good job so far, but the Seville Summit will be the deciding factor in our final judgment of it. Mr President-in-Office, may I make a point of reiterating what the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission just said, that is, that our group expects a high-ranking political working party of all three institutions to be set up in Seville to advise us and reach conclusions as to how we can improve our legislation so that, as the President of the Commission said, we can reach an institutional agreement by the end of this year. Prime Minister and President-in-Office José María Aznar has promised this to Parliament and I really do implore you to pass a resolution for us in Seville setting up this sort of political working party. If you do, our final judgment of the Spanish Presidency will be even more positive than it has been so far. As far as the reform of the Council is concerned, I quite understand your reticence, Mr President-in-Office, and I assume it is because you do not as yet have a brief to discuss it. I am sure I am right in assuming that the Spanish Presidency will do everything in its power to ensure that the Council as a legislative body is distinguished from the Council as an executive body and that, where it acts as legislator, it does so transparently. This is what we expect from Seville. You said that the president of the convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, would be submitting a report. I would be delighted if all the governments of the Member States of the European Union were to follow suit, if their representatives to the convention also reported back to their cabinets and governments in the Member States of the European Union, in order to ensure there is direct feedback, just as we do at parliamentary level. I should like on behalf of our group to make it perfectly clear that the debates in the Council today and at the summit in Seville must be predicated on strengthening the European Community, because we need strong European institutions and must not slip back into intergovernmentalism. I say this in the light of my visit to the United States over the last two days. Unless we act as a European Union, and we are hardly even perceived as a European Union in America; unless we strengthen the European Union, then we shall lose more and more clout internationally, which is why our objective must be to strengthen the European Community. (Applause)
 We acknowledge the Spanish Presidency's determined approach to the fight against terrorism. Our perception in Europe is different from the perception in the United States. The United States feels it is at war, because it is the first time it has been attacked on home territory. We have to understand that and we must do everything we can in Europe to help destroy terrorist networks. But we also have to say that terrorism and the fight against terrorism cannot be used as an excuse to violate human rights, be it in Africa, Chechnya or anywhere else. And we must make a clear distinction between terrorists, on the one hand, and the Arab and Islamic world on the other. That is why it is so important that the European Union continue in its endeavours to help broker peace in the Middle East. That we say to the Israelis, you have the right to live within secure borders and anyone who attacks those secure borders must be prepared to meet decisive resistance. But we must also say to the Palestinians that they have their dignity and the right to live within secure borders in a Palestinian state. We welcome your efforts in the fight against terrorism, we welcome your efforts to set up a common European border police to protect the external borders of the European Union and we hope that Seville will bring results. We recognise that Spain's efforts on the Sixth Research Framework Programme have been a huge success and we also hope – and this will be discussed more thoroughly this afternoon – to confirm the timetable for the enlargement of the European Union. I can only reiterate what President Prodi said: that we, the European Parliament, the European Council, the European Commission, the European institutions, are encouraging the countries of central Europe to conclude negotiations on the basis of the acquis communautaire, so that we can achieve results within the planned time frame and the countries of central Europe which sign accession agreements, together with Malta and – hopefully – Cyprus, can take part in the next European elections. We, the European Parliament, we, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, see ourselves as the champion of the nations seeking to join the European Union and my only request, from the bottom of my heart, is that we all help to keep to this timetable. (Applause)

Mr President, I would have kept my peace, had Mr Schulz refrained from making these comments. I have no wish to make a snap judgment of the conduct of the government referred to by Mr Schulz, let alone the conduct of a member of the Commission. But, my dear Mr Schulz, your comments would have had more credibility had you also criticised the fact that, when it was in line for a blue letter, the German Government put so much pressure on the Council of Ministers that in the end the letter was not sent. (Applause)
 You would have been more credible had you also had something to say when a member of your party in the Commission – I shall not name names because I do not want to open a can of worms – infringed Commission regulations. Please be assured that I have no wish to rake over old ashes. But you are being selective in your complaints and that casts doubt on your credibility, although it does not undermine what may well be well-founded criticism of the conduct of individual governments or Commissioners. That is all I have to say. We agreed that Commissioner Fischler should make a statement today. Commissioner Fischler is most welcome. But we should not make party political capital out of his statement. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr Secretary-General, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first a warm word of thanks to Secretary-General Solana – and of course to the Commissioner – but especially to the Secretary-General, because we generally agree on most points with the Commissioner anyway; a word of thanks for having kick-started the reform process in the Council. Secretary-General Solana, I should also like to offer you a heartfelt word of recognition for the almost superhuman work which you carry out around the world as our High Representative – with particular commitment in the Middle East – and as Secretary-General. It is only because you are such an extraordinary person that you can do this. I do not want to start an institutional debate on your office right now, but I cannot even begin to imagine that there is anyone else out there who could bear the double burden you have to bear and shoulder it so brilliantly. (Applause)
 I should like to offer you my warmest thanks for having tabled these proposals. As Commissioner Barnier said, we have a joint duty to reform our institutions, in this case the Council. The first thing we need to do here is to make a distinction between the General Affairs Council, the Council as legislator – which is, in fact, the most important Council – followed perhaps by the Council that prepares the meetings of the European Council and then of course the Foreign Affairs Council for foreign policy matters. We know – by name – who arrives late at the Foreign Affairs Council, leaves early and, in between, sits looking rather bored while the Council legislates, which is why we feel we need a European Affairs Council for European legislation and a separate Council for foreign policy in general. This European Affairs Council would always be present at legislative work and could also prepare the meetings of the European Council, the most important task of which is, of course, to legislate. The European Affairs Council would, of course, be responsible for appointing the representative to the Council/European Parliament conciliation committee when legislation is on the agenda. We know that at the moment officials – nothing against officials, it is just that they are not politicians – often attend as Council representatives and then consult with the European Parliament on the issues in question. But we need politicians who have the courage to bring about results with Parliament and we expressly support radical reform in this direction. We would also be doing the legislative process a service if the Council of Ministers or, perhaps, the Europe minister representing the presidency also attended Parliament when legislation is on the agenda or even that one or more representatives of the European Parliament – i.e. MEPs – attended the European Affairs Council when it is acting as legislator, so that the Council can ask the European Parliament for its views. There is still a great deal that needs to be debated here. What I should like to ask you to do, Secretary-General, is to discuss the matter again with the relevant committee – its chairman is right here – while you are preparing your paper and before you send your final report to Seville. If, understandably, you cannot do so personally, your representative could consult with the relevant committee. You rightly addressed the question of transparency, which is a matter of particular concern to Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen who, with Mr Poos, drafted the resolution to which our group still has a number of proposed amendments. Mrs Maij-Weggen is not here today because she left for the Netherlands after today's vote in order to take part in the elections, the outcome of which we are all waiting for with bated breath. We want maximum possible transparency, which is why the Council, when it holds legislative meetings, should meet in public once the reform process is completed. The media – including the television – should report on the Council, so that we know exactly how each individual government voted at the end. Please, Secretary-General, once it has finished with the regulation on transparency, let us instruct the interinstitutional working group to draw up guidelines for greater transparency which ensure that we get through to our citizens. Your proposals, what the Commission has said and our contributions basically go in the right direction. If we carry on working with commitment, we shall together achieve a good result for our institutions; and not just for our institutions, but for the European Union as a whole and for the citizens of Europe, and I wish both you and us success in our endeavour. (Applause)

 Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, both on behalf of my group and also on a very personal note I would like to pay homage to Magdalene Hoff for her excellent work in general and for her outstanding work on Kaliningrad. Because of the importance of this occasion, I would also like to thank you, my dear Magdalene – I have never before addressed anyone by their first name in an official speech, this is the first time – for our many years of excellent cooperation both here in this House of course, but also elsewhere, by which I mean Germany's European movement, the Europaunion
. Please accept my very best wishes for a speedy recovery, and many thanks for your marvellous work! (Applause)
 I would like to express my sympathy for the victims of the attack in Kaspiisk in Dagestan, who were murdered on 9 May. There were many children amongst the more than 30 people killed. As Commissioner Patten has already said, terrorism can never be justified. We hope that nothing like this will ever happen again. As Commissioner Patten and Mr de Miguel, the President-in-Office, have said – and I hope that they will raise this at the summit – we call on the Russian Government, should it turn out that these attacks, these acts of violence were committed by Chechens – and in the case of Dagestan that is a supposition for which there is still no proof – not to equate these terrorists, these perpetrators of violence with the Chechen people. No, the civilian population of Chechnya should be protected… (Applause)
 ... and we should use the negotiating process to ensure that Chechnya has a good future. Overall, we believe that our relations with Russia are of a strategic nature. Our relations with the United States are of strategic significance, our relations with the Mediterranean area are of strategic significance and of course the enlargement of the European Union is also of strategic significance, but as I have said, so are our relations with Russia. Our relations need to be founded on democratic principles, on the rule of law, on social and market-economy principles and above all on human rights and human dignity. It is on that basis that we wish to cooperate with Russia politically, economically and in terms of security policy. We also want to emphasise what has already just been mentioned here – a common European economic area and maximising cooperation with Russia. However, I would like to add, because this is occasionally mentioned, that I cannot imagine, and nor can the majority of my group, in fact I think we are as one on this, that Russia could become a member of the European Union, in view of its size. I think that needs saying, in all honesty. However, we do want to extend economic relations, to dismantle trade barriers and to encourage greater investment in Russia. That means overcoming certain obstacles. We wish to cooperate in the area of internal security. Not long ago I visited Finland with the chairman of our group. Finland shares a common border with Russia and has exemplary security controls on that border. We need to create something comparable for all our borders with Russia. I wish to call on the Russian Government to do its part to make sure that we also achieve security in relation to Kaliningrad. As I have already used up my speaking time, I would just like to add that we have every intention of stepping up relations with the Russian Federation, because security in our continent in the twenty-first century is largely dependent on the European Union and Russia being able to act, and on Russia hopefully also being democratic, because together there is a great future for us in the European continent that we share. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the applause just then for Commissioner Patten has made clear that we must never let a situation stop us talking to each other, even when it is highly dramatic and seems almost an expression of desperation. For if we stop talking to each other, it is only the weapons that will be left to speak. That this debate on the Mediterranean dialogue should be held here today, is important, and I would like to express from the heart my gratitude to the Spanish Presidency of the Council for the commitment they have shown. Despite the shocking events in the Middle East, the Mediterranean dialogue has probably never been as necessary as it is today, for we face today the great danger of a real clash of civilisations breaking out. It will do that once our own heads become the places where we wall the cultures off from one another. That is why our task, in these days and in the future, must be to carry on this dialogue between cultures. That must be right at the top of our agenda. What now shocks me is to hear, on the one hand, that it is proposed to establish a foundation for dialogue between cultures, which we welcome, but on the other that the million euro – obviously not a very substantial amount – may well not be made available. If we sign documents that then lose their value, then when we leave the conference, the conferences will have no value either! So I ask the Spanish Presidency and the Commission to ensure that the money required will also be made available, so that we can bring this dialogue about. (Applause)
 In these weeks and months, looking forward to the enlargement of the European Union, our gaze is directed principally towards the East, but it is important that we turn our eyes southwards, as the perils there are probably far greater than our problems in Eastern Europe. If it is the case that the distance from Algeria's capital Algiers to Paris is shorter than that from Paris to Warsaw, then this must make it clear to us in geographical terms that the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East are of great significance to Europeans like us. We advocate a real partnership for us with the Mediterranean, with the countries of North Africa, and with the Middle East – both political and strategic, economic and financial, social and cultural. Of course it is important to combat terrorism, and that is a struggle we all support. We must not, though, reduce our dialogue with the Arab and Islamic world to simply fighting terrorism; it must, rather, be a dialogue that includes all the political, economic, financial and cultural issues. That is why we have so much more to do in those areas than we have done in the past. (Applause)
 Of course it is important that we should have a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly. That is what we have called for. We would, though, be failing in our responsibility as Europeans and as a Parliament if we believed that the creation of such an institution would mean that all our tasks had been completed. On the contrary, what matters is that we make a reality of our solemn declarations. After visiting Israel a number of times, I visited many states in the Arab world, and I have the impression that these countries will be able to live in security, freedom and democracy only if we really do manage to create jobs there. As the Commissioner said, 40 million jobs are needed around the Mediterranean. If they are not created, then the young people will carry on getting into boats, and – as is estimated – 7 000 people from Morocco alone will lose their lives in the attempt to reach Spain or Portugal across the Mediterranean. That is why development in these countries must be a success. Above all, we must help with the privatisation of their economy and help give private enterprises a chance to use that to create jobs. As education is one of the most important prerequisites for human development, and above all for the actualisation of human rights, illiteracy in the states of North Africa must be done away with. Turning to the Middle East, the seriousness and complexity of this area of concern has meant that these issues have been the subject of in-depth discussions in our group as well, but we start by saying that the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth must come to an end. If things carry on like that, there will never be peace in the Middle East. That is why it is so important that the Israeli troops should withdraw now. At the same time, though, we declare it to be criminal to talk young people into strapping self-detonating devices to themselves in order to kill both themselves and others as well. That is why we must make demands equally of both sides, of the Israelis as much as of the Palestinians. We must also not lose sight of the fact that our American friends cannot be peacemakers on their own. The Americans will of course have to make a major contribution, but, for various reasons, the Palestinians trust us Europeans more than they do our American friends. This, then, is another reason – Israel is of course one, but this is another – why we have to take on important responsibilities in the region. Israel does, thank God, also have some very credible representatives. Yesterday in the Conference of Presidents, we had talks with Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset, and I have to tell you that this conversation gave me renewed hope, because Israel also has political figures who put reconciliation first rather than conflict and military action. We urge the parties involved – the Palestinians, the Israelis, the world community – onward to redouble their efforts so that peace may at last reign in the Middle East, so that we Europeans may also have a good future with the countries around the Mediterranean, and so that Israel and Palestine may be able to live within secure borders. That alone will serve the cause of human rights in the Middle East. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we had a very solemn debate here in Parliament about the situation in the Middle East, and I think that the debate on Chechnya deserves the same degree of solemnity. There is an open wound in Europe: in Chechnya, in the Russian Federation. As members of the European People's Party, as European Democrats, we say that security in Europe, on our continent, in the twenty-first century will depend on our having a democratic ... (Applause)
 ... European Union, which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights, and on our having a democratic Russia, which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights, and on both – the European Union and Russia – working together as partners. We want to have a strategic partnership of this kind because it is important for the future of our continent. We must not remain silent, however, when human rights are violated, and of all people, we in the European Parliament must not remain silent. Some observers are saying that more people are dying in Chechnya than in the Middle East. Our group believes that a Chechen life is of equal value to the life of a citizen of the United States or a citizen of the European Union ... (Applause)
 … and that the life of a Muslim in Chechnya is of equal value to the life of a Christian, a Jew, a Palestinian, a Hindu, a Buddhist or a person of no belief. (Applause)
 Human rights – and it is particularly because we are Europeans that this matters to us – are indivisible the world over. (Applause)
 The President of the Russian Federation is currently visiting a Member State of the European Union. Last night I heard his statement on Chechnya on German television. The Russian Ambassador to the European Union, Mr Likhachev, and the President of the Committee for Foreign Affairs in the Duma, Dimitri Rogozin, called to see me last week in Brussels to inform me about the situation. I am pleased that our debate on Chechnya has also provided an opportunity for them to contact our group. Clearly we have to fight terrorism, but we must not do so in such a way that this has a disproportionate impact on the human rights and lives of the people in Chechnya, of civilians who want to live in peace. (Applause)
 If a study from the US State Department dated 4 March, statements from Médecins Sans Frontières
 – an organisation which we esteem greatly because of its commitment – and the organisation Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, all say that the Russian soldiers have hardly any respect for human life, then this has to set the alarm bells ringing. If the Duma representative for Chechnya, Aslambek Aslakhanov, says – and this shows that Russia is also on the road to democracy, and we do of course recognise this – that 80% of the aid which Russia provides for Chechnya is not even reaching the people, then this has to set the alarm bells ringing. If Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, says that the economic, social and cultural situation in Chechnya is very grave, despite some progress – which we have of course also noted – then this has to set the alarm bells ringing. These are descriptions of the situation by organisations and high-profile leaders who know more about what is happening than we do. But it is our duty, as Members of the European Parliament, to debate these massive violations of human rights which are taking place in Russia and therefore in Europe, in Chechnya, for as long as they continue to be a reality. We therefore call for a ceasefire and a political solution. Those Russian soldiers who have no respect for civilian lives, who have scant regard for human dignity and human life, should not only be criticised for their actions in political statements in Moscow; we call for them also to be brought before the courts and for judgment to be passed on them, because if not the violations of human rights will just go on and on. (Applause)
 We also call on Russia to open up Chechnya to observers – to an even greater extent than it has done so far – and also to work with organisations in the European Union. The President-in-Office of the Council and also the Commissioner referred to this and generally speaking we are of the same mind. In addition, we in the European Parliament should ask our delegation and the corresponding delegation in the Duma – and Parliament should as it were give the go-ahead for this – to establish a well-ordered procedure for attending to Chechnya properly on an ongoing basis. Soon – as we of course already decided on 16 March – we should send a European Parliament delegation to Chechnya and that region. For my part I would very much welcome it if you, Commissioner, were personally to travel there to speak to those affected on the ground. (Applause)
 Finally, we need to cooperate closely with Lord Judd of the Council of Europe, who is of course very involved in working on this problem, and overall we need a political solution. Allow me, in conclusion, to say the following: I have visited all of the republics of the former Soviet Union, including Tatarstan. Tatarstan, the capital of which is Kazan, has a high degree of autonomy, indeed the greatest degree of autonomy in the Russian Federation. Why is it not possible for Chechnya to have something comparable? The representatives of Chechnya, who were here two months ago, appeared to have lost all hope; they were depressed and their concern and despair were palpable. It is our duty as the European Parliament to give hope to those who want to live in peace in Chechnya – within the Russian Federation, but with autonomous status of some kind – and to act as an advocate for human rights on this continent and throughout the world, including in Chechnya. (Applause)

 Mr President, on Monday our group made a request for the vote on this motion to be taken tomorrow, because this would have enabled us to take account of the Madrid Summit. (Heckling)
 First listen to what I have to say! After all we are exchanging arguments and each side needs to take the other seriously. You are fighting for human rights, so listen too to what the chairman of the PPE-DE Group has to say! (Applause from the right)
 We proposed voting tomorrow so that we could react to the Madrid Summit. This would also have given us more time to reach agreement on the substance because it does not make much sense for us to vote on the Middle East if the result will not be unanimous. Now, this was objected to on the grounds that we in the European Parliament needed to send another very strong signal to Madrid. The Madrid Summit, at least as far as the Middle East is concerned, is over, and even if there were to be a majority in favour of this motion here today, the European Parliament would no longer be able to send a signal to influence the outcome of Madrid. Your argument for getting this through today is no longer valid. I would ask you to take note of this at least! (Applause from the right)
 On the issue itself, I very much regret to have to tell you that our group cannot endorse the joint motion for a resolution as it stands. Rarely have we debated anything with each other more extensively, at greater length and on such a serious basis, and in this debate political, moral and historical points have been put forward. We are very critical of the policy of the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon. But we ought also to have called in the resolution – and as it stands this is not the case – for, for example, the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yassir Arafat, to address the Palestinians in the Arabic language and call a halt to the terror of the suicide bombings. (Applause and heckling)
 I am only saying what the terms of our discussion were; we also take your arguments seriously, and as far as the moral and political issues are concerned we claim the same arguments for our group. But – and here I turn to the Commission, to Mr Nielson; Commissioner, I would be grateful if you would listen to me – we also have questions about how the money, which the European Union makes available to the Palestinian-controlled areas, is used. Since this does not appear in the motion, but very many other remarks ... (Heckling and violent protests from the left, applause from the right)
 Loud shouts have never yet been an argument powerful enough to win me round, and if that is now the new argument of the left in the European Parliament then my group will not find it very persuasive. (Applause from the right)
 So, in summary, the vast majority of our group will not be voting in favour of this motion as it stands because we deem it to be imbalanced. There are, however, other colleagues who have told me that they have decided on the basis of their own conscience to support this motion, and we respect that. Incidentally, we wish the Secretary of State of the United States, Colin Powell, who is now travelling to Palestine, every success. We hope that he will not only see Mr Sharon, but also Mr Arafat, and that this will contribute to the quest for a peaceful solution in the Middle East. Our group sends its best wishes to the American Secretary of State for his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the proposal to timetable Mr Solana's statement for 5 p.m. tomorrow, and to combine it with a debate, so that the time from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. would then be available for it. Members must also be aware of the fact – which we must view sympathetically – that Mr Solana cannot be here on Wednesday, as he will be on his way to meet the American Secretary of State in Madrid. We in Parliament have to accept this reason for his absence. I have, though, one request, and would be grateful if other groups could join me in making it. I am, in particular, addressing Mr Barón Crespo, as I do not want to place conditions on our agreement to defer the vote on budgetary control. We have, though, accepted your argument, and I ask you to accept, when we prepare a resolution on the Middle East, that the vote be held on Thursday rather than on Wednesday. Our group is not actually in favour of a resolution, but the Conference of Presidents took the contrary view that there should be one. As democrats, we accept that. We will also be joining in the negotiation of a resolution, although we already had a very sound resolution in the last part-session, and will be playing our part as the ground-rules of Parliament require. If, though, negotiations take place on Wednesday in Madrid between the European Union – represented by Mr Solana and Mr Piquet – on the one hand and Secretary of State Powell on the other, it must be possible for the results of their discussions to find their way into the text along with everything else. That will probably not be that straightforward in procedural terms, but the groups here should in any case be able to comment verbally on what comes out of Madrid. It is, then, my urgent request that we should not vote on the text of the resolution on Wednesday – that would in any case be too late for the talks in Madrid – but should vote on Thursday, when the results from Madrid will be known. I should be grateful if you could agree to that, for we too are accommodating when you bring to this House matters in which you have a justifiable interest. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it was with deep revulsion and regret that we learnt of the murder of Marco Biagi, and our sympathy goes to his family. My group has a message for all terrorists, in Europe and throughout the world – we will never give in to terrorism. Giving in to terrorism means undermining the democratic order. We will use every democratic and constitutional means at our disposal to resolutely combat terrorism in Europe and worldwide. I would like to thank the President of Parliament, Pat Cox, very warmly for the very practical and political proposals he presented to the European Council. I believe that they provided a good basis for debate. The President-in-Office of the European Council and the President of the Commission, whom we wish a safe journey to Italy to pay his respects to his murdered friend and his family, have already indicated how indebted we are to Mr Cox for his contribution. However, I would also like to say a special word of thanks to the President-in-Office of the European Council and to pay homage to the fact that he is speaking to us here in the European Parliament three times during the Spanish Presidency. Today is the second time. I hope that this will set a good example for future presidencies. The Barcelona Summit was one which we too in general view positively. But a good many wishes have still of course to be fulfilled. The language used is interesting. Mr President-in-Office, the European Council is calling on us – Parliament and the Council – to open the energy market for supply companies within a specific time frame. We would have been grateful if the European Council had also called upon us to open the European energy market for consumers, because we would have been very happy to do that. The indecisiveness of the Council, which can be attributed to a single Member State – and I know that the President-in-Office of the European Council has made every effort in this respect– and this negative attitude have been obscured by this request to the Council and the European Parliament. We really wanted more than that. We wish to warmly congratulate you on your decision. Mr President-in-Office, I am also aware of the personal commitment that you made to ensuring that the Galileo Programme now has a future, which is of strategic importance for Europe. I am pleased that it has been possible to overcome both the political and financial obstacles. We are also delighted to see you declaring your belief in stability and calling for a near-balanced budget for all the Member States of the European Union by 2004. But we would have been a great deal happier if the Barcelona European Council could have said that it welcomed the Commission's approach in wishing to send two Member States of the European Union a warning letter, which, as we all know, was ultimately blocked by the finance ministers because of the specific attitude of one Member State. We hope that this positive statement about a near-balanced budget will also be implemented in practice in future, with the Commission receiving support for its efforts to achieve stability in its relations with the Member States of the European Union. It would also lend credibility to the European Council if the finance ministers were also to take appropriate and concrete measures. (Applause)
 Mr President-in-Office, we sincerely welcome the fact that the Heads of State and Government have adopted such a strong line on the Middle East. We are very much in favour of the Palestinians being given a state in a dignified manner, and we are also very much in favour of Israel being able to live within secure borders. But that involves combating terrorism on both sides. We do not think it is right, and I am glad that you referred to this, for the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, to be placed under house arrest, and for it still to be doubtful whether he will be able to take part in the Arab summit in Beirut. We need to ensure that he can participate in that summit. We have of course decided to invite Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres to the European Parliament. We want to be free to invite these figures, and also need to be sure that they can return home again afterwards. (Applause from the right)
 I would like to address two other aspects that follow on from Barcelona. The first of these is the reform of the Council. Mr President-in-Office, back in January you said that you were in favour of an interinstitutional working group bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and we have heard from your side that this is now actually to take place. However, we have received information that this is to be blocked at a certain level, and I do not mean a political level. We wish to encourage you to go ahead with this interinstitutional working group at political level, amongst other things by ensuring that the President of the Parliament is represented by a Member of this House, so that we can achieve positive results in Seville. If we can achieve good results in Seville, that will be to the credit of the Spanish Presidency and also to your personal credit. We all stand to benefit from that. A conference on the Mediterranean dialogue is to be held in Valencia on 21 and 22 April, to be chaired by your Minister of Foreign Affairs, but I am sure you will also be present. I have just returned from Algeria and my impression is that however much we are looking towards the candidate countries from the East, we also need to look to the South, as developments in some countries in the southern Mediterranean area are so dramatic that that will also have to be a focus for our policy. We cannot be satisfied with theoretical policy decisions; we also need wide-ranging cooperation as regards our economies, the financial sector and also between the peoples involved. I would urge you to pay careful attention to the Barcelona Process in the context of the Mediterranean dialogue. My group will certainly support you in this, and we wish you every success for the second half of your presidency. If you listen a little to us and to the Commission, then I am sure that it will be a very successful presidency. I wish the Spanish Presidency every success. (Applause from the right)

 Mr President, our group, too, thanks you for your statement, and we are right alongside you as regards a peace settlement, or the attempt at one, in the Middle East. This debate is not about the Middle East, as we want to discuss enlargement, but it is our profound conviction that we will be successful in the fight against terrorism only if we, that is the United States of America and the European Union, support the peace process between Israel and Palestine with equal determination and in the same way, something on which there could be stronger signals from the West, to which we belong. I am much obliged to you for your initiative. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party/European Democrats, supports the general directions taken both by the President-in-Office of the Council and by Commissioner Verheugen. In saying, at the end of his speech, that Parliament's support is indispensable, the Commissioner was expressing a truth. We, too, hope that the whole process in which we find ourselves will lead to an outcome that will enable the Council, the Commission, and Parliament to declare themselves satisfied with it and to adopt what the negotiations have produced. Like Commissioner Verheugen, the President-in-Office of the Council again put the emphasis on timing. It was indeed our Group that proposed that the negotiations should be conducted in such a way that the first countries to join the EU should be able to take part in the 2004 European elections. This makes it necessary that we should complete negotiations by the end of this year and by the beginning of 2003 at the latest. I hope that this will be possible under the Danish Presidency, for the completion of the negotiations would complete the cycle that began when the Copenhagen criteria were laid down ten years ago. It is also beautifully symbolic in a particular way that the Presidency at this important stage is held by Spain, a country of the South, thus focusing attention on the significance of the centre of Europe and expressing our common political intention that EU enlargement – which of course involves Cyprus and Malta, but mainly the central European states – should not be about the interests of a few Member States of the European Union, but about our common interest, that of all the Member States of the European Union. There is of course still much work to be done, as we all know. We should not now give any country a guarantee and tell them that they are in whatever happens; rather, every country must make the effort so that we can achieve satisfactory outcomes at the end of the day. We know that many chapters still have to be negotiated on. Whilst hoping for results on them, we also say – and, whilst not being an expert on agriculture myself, I do say this for my own part also – that our farmers have, in the European Union, Agenda 2000 to protect their legitimate expectations, and we see the mid-term review, to be presented by Commissioner Fischler, not as being about various things that actually have nothing to do with enlargement, but we want to safeguard our farmers' confidence as well. Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Kaliningrad has been mentioned, and, Mr Verheugen, I emphatically support what you said. I recently spoke with the Mayor of Pillau, which is in the Western part of the Kaliningrad region, where there is very great interest in the possibility of direct contact with the Commission in Brussels and a concern that not everything should be done via Moscow, which is a long way away. Perhaps, in our discussions with Russia, we might also ensure that there are immediate and direct links between Kaliningrad, formerly Königsberg, and the European Union and its Member States. I also wish to mention the Ukraine, the western part of which, as we know, was formerly eastern Poland. However much we, naturally, have to guarantee border security – and we must make every effort to ensure that the Mafia, drug trafficking and serious crime cannot get into the European Union across Poland's eastern border – we should, at the same time, be flexible in order that the people there who have ties across the border, who live in Western Ukraine and are of Polish origin, may also have flexible solutions in their dealings with Poland, so that no new Iron Curtain may descend there to separate people from each other. I believe that this will be of immense significance as regards our relations with the Ukraine. I believe that we – Council, Commission and Parliament – have a common task, in that we need to work much harder at persuading people, not only in the candidate countries but also in the European Union, that the membership of the central European countries and also Malta and Cyprus is a massive opportunity for the European Union – and particularly for the countries of central Europe – to establish stability on our continent. It is, though, also an economic opportunity, as trade between the European Union and the central European states has in the meantime almost equalled in scale our trade with the United States of America. This unleashes a dynamic that is to the benefit of all of us. If, when considering enlargement, we cast our eyes eastwards in particular, it is very important that we, especially in days like these – so we thank you again, Mr President, for your initiative on the Middle East – also look southwards, to the Mediterranean region. Eastward enlargement enjoys equal priority with our relations with the Mediterranean countries and with the Arab and Islamic world. If, as a European Union, we act with determination, courage and an eye to the future, then, I believe, we will also be able to accomplish a great work for peace and contribute to stability in our environment, both to the East and South of the European Union. I believe this to be the common task of the Council, the Commission and Parliament. If we, together, bring that to pass, you, in the Commission and in the Council, will of course have our unqualified support. (Applause)

Mr President, I really did not understand that. I really do crave your indulgence. The outcome, according to the translation, was that the subject is going to be debated on Wednesday, but, if I understand rightly, it is meant to be debated on Tuesday. Could we perhaps clarify this again? It was not, in any case, entirely clear in the German translation.

Mr President, for the sake of clarifying the proceedings, let me say that our group is very committed on the issue of Chechnya, and if, today, we support the motion to remove the topic from the agenda for this week's part-session, that does not mean that we are not going to continue to be committed on the issue. We want first to await the visit of a parliamentary delegation to Moscow and then return to this topic in an in-depth debate in May at the latest. I would like to make that explicit today. We remain committed on this issue and our attention is entirely focused on Chechnya. If, then, we are in favour of removing this topic from the agenda for this sitting, that does not mean that our commitment to the issue is any the less.

Mr President, I wish to make one thing clear: my group did not actually want to ask for the removal of this item, but we were informed that the PSE Group had asked for it and then we said, very well,… (Interruptions)
 Just listen for a moment! I always listen to you. So we said that, in order to have a large majority in this House and to remain committed to the topic, we favour removing it for this week, but finding in the immediate future an appropriate procedure in order that we may get to grips with this topic in a way it very much deserves, with the Council and the Commission present if necessary. It is only on this basis that we are in favour of dealing with this topic, not as a matter of urgency this week, but at a later juncture and in a far more appropriate format. That is the condition we impose.

Mr President, I do not at this moment want to go into the fundamental question of whether it makes sense to deal with such an important contribution to debate by the President of the Commission on the basis of who manages to catch the President's eye. We will certainly have to discuss that on another occasion. Mr President of the Commission, we can of course go along with everything that you have said. You spoke about enlargement, and I would ask you to think – and perhaps say something later – about whether you in the Commission might also apply the system we want to introduce after the accession treaties are signed, that of having observers from the candidate countries here in Parliament. Do you think it might be possible to involve figures from the candidate countries in the work of the Commission, while these countries are not, as yet, Members? You then talked about the Mediterranean. If it is true that around 7 000 deaths a year occur in the Mediterranean, for example among people in transit by boat from Morocco to Spain or Portugal, how can we, on the one hand, achieve an improvement in the situation in these countries, and, on the other, make the prevention of these pitiable people's deaths an achievement for our security policy? You spoke about the Mediterranean Bank, which can be a positive element to which we are not opposed, but no structures must be created in addition to the European Investment Bank. I would therefore be grateful if you could say something about that. You spoke about stability, and, as far as stability and the repatriation of debts in national budgets are concerned, I would like to encourage the Commission to keep on course and write your warning letter, as you had planned, ... (Applause)
 ... to both these Member States. I find it an unacceptable system in which those who are at the end of the day to be criticised, themselves decide whether such criticism should be meted out! I think we need quite new ways of forming judgments in this area. My final observation, Mr President, is perhaps aimed more at us ourselves, but I would be grateful if the President of the Commission could say something about it. (Interruptions)
 Just calm down! It is your convictions too that I am expressing. The Council is not here today. I do not want to criticise anybody, but we must prepare for the future, and for the reform of the Council, by ensuring that the Council is represented when the President of the Commission makes an important statement in this House. This is not now aimed solely at the Spanish Presidency; it is a topic of general relevance to the reform of the Council. I believe that there is an urgent need for reforms to the European Council of Ministers! (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by welcoming the Commission's presence here in such numbers, with not just President Prodi, but also Vice-President de Palacio and Mrs Reding and Mr Solbes from the Commission itself. I believe – and Mrs Wallström is also present, sitting in the second row; I crave your forbearance for not mentioning you at the outset, but being greeted separately is so much more effective – that this shows the importance we attach to cooperation between the institutions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, a subject on which I shall make a few concluding remarks. What the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission said in Barcelona meets with our entire approval. In your own country, Mr President-in-Office, you and your own policies have been very successful over the past years. You are, though, a natural heir to the tradition of the Lisbon decisions, which are framed in very demanding terms: the most dynamic, most competitive and most sustainable economic area is to come into being. We would all, I think, be the better off for more modest language, as criticism would then be less marked when we fail to act according to these principles and in line with these objectives. Although it is clear to us that the Spanish Presidency has been led into a difficult situation here – which is why I do not want to criticise the Presidency too harshly – our group would very much have welcomed it if the Finance Ministers of the EU countries had gone along with the Commission's proposals when what was at issue was the requirement that two EU countries should actually abide by the Stability and Growth Pact. It is, among other things, an institutional problem when those who will be giving out marks at the end of the day who deserve to get bad ones, and when, moreover, these people promise something for 2004, namely, an almost balanced budget, which we already know to be scarcely achievable. We therefore call for credibility and stability and urge that we should keep to what we agreed in the treaties on the common European currency. Our group stands alongside the Commission, whom I encourage to stick to their stability policy and pursue it consistently, and we would welcome it if the Finance Ministers were to take that on board. Mr President-in-Office, you were right to speak about small and medium-sized enterprises, and I was glad to hear that an informal Council has been held. I believe that we should, in our economic policy as a whole, give much more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The best economic policy would be for us to maintain a moderate tax regime. The more we lift the tax burden from small and medium-sized enterprises and liberate them from bureaucracy as well, the more they will be able to invest and also create jobs. That then benefits the workers, and so it is right to put small and medium-sized enterprises centre stage. You were right to speak about the liberalisation of the markets, of the markets in transport, energy, and, I would like to add, postal and financial services. One could get the impression from the use of the expression ‘liberalisation’ that it is something that benefits the income of enterprises. No, ladies and gentlemen, we must say more distinctly that liberalisation means more competition, more competition means reduced prices, and reduced prices benefit precisely those people – that is, consumers – who do not have such high incomes, and that is why it is important that we bring this competition about. In order that I do not go over time, this will have to be my last comment. Mr President-in-Office, our group will judge the Spanish Presidency by how it succeeds in reforming the Council. Mr Solana, the Council Secretary-General, will, if I am rightly informed, be submitting proposals in Barcelona for reform of the Council. There is also now a paper by the British Prime Minister and German Chancellor, and Mr Aznar, the President of the Council, has no doubt followed it sympathetically. It is not enough to make public statements, though, if we want to reform the Council; that desire must be communicated to the Permanent Representatives. I get the impression that what is being thought by the Heads of Government has not yet reached the inter-institutional working party set up by the Council, the Commission and Parliament. So I ask you to contribute to the Council's reform of itself, to have it, as a legislature, always sitting in public, and always present here when important debates take place in Parliament. If you achieve that, your Presidency will be counted a success! We want it to be a success, because we want a shared success for Europe. The Commission is, in any case, standing alongside Parliament, and if we take action together, the success will be Europe's, and from the depths of my heart I want some of its lustre to reflect on the Spanish Presidency. By the way, I hope that, next time you visit Parliament, you will at once be given a drink, because we always treat our guests well. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had the opportunity to congratulate our President on his new office on 15 January, and I want to do so again today. Mr President, I would like to express our group's congratulations and appreciation to you for the way you have just spoken. One got the feeling from your speech that your role as President is not just a representative duty for you, but that politics, what we can do here in Parliament, is something close to your heart. In any case, it is that sentiment that communicated itself to us. We want to thank you for that and express the hope that you will be able to keep to this policy in these two and a half years of practical work. Mr President, I feel particular gratitude for the way you spoke out in favour of us inviting observers from the candidate countries to Parliament and to our groups once the treaties have been signed. I think that this idea, which our Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has promoted for some time, is an excellent one. We must make it clear that political debate must not be dominated by such issues as when agricultural aid is going to be fully operational in the candidate countries, when these or those other conditions are going to be complied with, but we must rather be saying clearly even now to people in the candidate countries: you are welcome in our community of shared values. That is why we also want soon to welcome to Parliament members of the national parliaments as observers, as partners in dialogue, as people with whom we can discuss the future of Europe. We are right alongside you if you are about to put that formally into effect by means of resolutions. You rightly spoke about the strategic partnership in the Mediterranean countries, in which context you mentioned human rights. It is easy for us in this House to talk about human rights in quite abstract terms. We have been talking about terrorism in recent weeks and months. My group is definitely in favour of combating terrorism, but, in the weeks, months and years ahead, we must take care not to permit violations of human rights in the name of counter-terrorism. (Applause)
 This means that we must speak out when human rights are violated. Let me give Chechnya as a quite specific example. We must not close our eyes to what is happening in Chechnya just because we say we have to combat terrorism. This is something we cannot allow! (Applause)
 You mentioned interinstitutional balance. It is with great disquiet that I see how some governments are now trying, for whatever reasons they may have, to cut down to size the European Commission's role as Guardian of the Treaties. Even though it may bring us into dispute with a government on our side, our group will not permit a crucial Community institution such as the Commission to have its rights and powers interfered with. It is the Commission that is the Guardian of the Treaties! Madam Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, we urge you to pursue this approach with determination. We are there alongside you. Much has been said about the Convention. We are, in fact, going to be discussing it this afternoon with the President. I believe that, right from the start, we have to counteract the impression that it is not the Convention that is to play the principal role. We have a praesidium in which there are three people with specific offices: the chairman and his two deputies. We need working procedures for the Convention. That is the new method and you have given it expression. We need a way of working that is transparent and public, and that is why the Convention as a whole must be at the heart of the work. The work cannot be delegated to the praesidium, to the triumvirate of the chairman and his two deputies. It is clear that the leadership function naturally devolves upon the praesidium, but the work tempo – including the frequency of the Convention's meetings – must be such that it is the Convention that conducts the debate on the future of Europe. Turning to the issue of the statute, which you have addressed, our group supports the introduction of a Members' Statute, but we also say that Members' independence, integrity and dignity must be guaranteed, and, in law, it is we who draw up the Members' Statute – and not the Council! So, at the end of the day, this is not about us saying ‘yes’ to something proposed by the Council, but rather we are the ones who make the proposal, and then we must work with the Council towards a result. Please permit me a concluding observation, Mr President. You have just referred to Mr von Wogau's report on the financial services proposals and on the Lamfalussy Final Report, on which we voted yesterday. I am addressing my remarks to Mr Ramón de Miguel and to the Council when I say that this was a fine hour for the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. If that is how we go about our business in future, we will achieve something. This is not just about which of us – Commission, Council or Parliament – achieves the most; on the contrary, our common task is to get Europe moving. Your speech, Mr President, was manifestly in this spirit. We stand alongside you, encouraging you to be committed and consistent in giving your words practical expression over the next two and a half years. (Applause)

Mr President, it is being stated that President Prodi took a position in a press conference yesterday on Commissioner Verheugen's behaviour in the Commission. This has to do with Stability Pact issues. Mr Verheugen is alleged to have assented in the Commission to the Commission's decisions, but then, last Sunday, to have dissociated himself from them in an interview with a German newspaper. I wish to ask you to give consideration to a procedure whereby we, that is, in Parliament or some appropriate forum, might hear an explanation of this from Mr Verheugen. That is my request, which I would like to make a matter of public record.

Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the events of 11 September and subsequent action taken in Afghanistan and the current situation in the Middle East, have pushed into the background a matter that both Mr Solana and Mr Patten have mentioned, namely a peaceful settlement in Macedonia. I wish to say a word of thanks to Mr Solana, the High Representative and also to Commissioner Patten, but also to all the others who have played their part there in making Macedonia peaceful today. This is a gigantic success for the European Union, for which our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks you. (Applause)
 In these days and weeks, we are looking eastwards. We expect there to be new countries in the European Union in the next few years. I will, though, say quite emphatically and underline what the High Representative said, that it is important to our security in Europe that we achieve peace in the Middle East and that we, as Europeans, cooperate peacefully and well with all the countries of the Mediterranean region. We will also state that, when these problems are under discussion, we must first just put people on centre stage. We state quite clearly that the life and human dignity of a Christian and a non-Christian in Europe, the life of a Jew, an Israeli in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the life of a Palestinian, of a Muslim in Ramallah or the Gaza Strip are of the same value, and no distinction must be made between human rights in Europe, in the Islamic world or anywhere else on this earth. (Applause)
 We wholeheartedly agree with both Mr Solana and also Mr Patten in declaring our need of dialogue and of partnership. These involve us telling the truth and not going along with irresponsible language. When, for example, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says, in Thursday's issue of ‘Maariv’ – and I am quoting him verbatim: ‘In Lebanon’ – that is, in 1982 – ‘it was agreed that Arafat was not to be eliminated. To tell the truth, I regret that we did not eliminate him.’ – that is irresponsible language. That is the sort of language that leads to war; it is not the sort of language that brings about reconciliation. (Applause)
 I find it difficult, even in view of my nationality – and I was born after the war – to say this here. I find it cynical of the Israeli Prime Minister to respond to our criticism of his attitude by speaking of a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. No, we are not anti-Semitic. We want Israel to live in peace within secure borders. In that, we stand alongside all Israelis. This has absolutely nothing to do with anti-Semitism. We reject that appellation with all the decisiveness we have. (Applause)
 We have, of course, demands to make of Yasser Arafat. He wrote a remarkable article in the ‘New York Times’ a few days ago. In it he says that he intends to redouble his efforts against terrorism from the Palestinian side, thus expressing the possibility that he might not have previously done all that was necessary. So we also call on Yasser Arafat to do more in this respect in the places where he has influence, knowing as we do that he does not have all the Palestinian groupings under his control. Mr Solana also mentioned the weapons shipments on the Karine-A
. We too want to have information on who they were intended for. We urge Arafat to provide information on this. I believe that we Europeans have, along with the Americans, a great task ahead of us. The Americans, though, must also understand that they have to give Israel and Palestine equal treatment, and that both sides have the same dignity. Secretary of State Powell, in an interview a few days ago, spoke of Palestine's right to exist, its right to be a state. All this we welcome. I think that we, Europeans and Americans together, now have a common task, to contribute to peace in that region. Yasser Arafat is, of course, the elected President of Palestine. If we do not accept him as a partner in dialogue, then there can be no peace and no dialogue. We therefore call on Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat to make a start on peace by talking to each other so that people in the region, in the Middle East, can have a future worthy of human beings. All those who promote that, such as Javier Solana, Chris Patten and others, have the full support of our group. (Applause)

Mr President, I had not actually intended to speak, but I do of course have something to say whenever the others have something to say. (Laughter)
 I would like first to say a few words of thanks to you for the way you dealt with this issue. As Mr Lehne said, a majority of our group was in favour of legal proceedings, but there were other opinions, such as that of the esteemed Mr Karl von Wogau. I liked, however, the way you dealt with the issue politically, telephoning the President-in-Office of the Council, the Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, and, of course, keeping in touch with the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi. We, of course, have confidence in the Spanish Prime Minister; not only in that role do we trust that he will keep his word and that words will be matched by deeds, but also in his role as President-in-Office of the Council. I also have something to say to the Commission. So, Commissioner, please tell the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, that, tomorrow, when we deal with Mr von Wogau's report, with financial services and with everything we associate with ‘Lamfalussy’, we expect the Commission to take up a position in defence of Parliament's rights vis-à-vis the Council of Ministers. That is what we expect tomorrow. If such a statement is not forthcoming, it will have serious consequences for our relations with the Commission, and so, Mr President, your action will no doubt help the President with his statement tomorrow. Again, let me extend my express thanks to you for the way you have handled this matter politically. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am no expert on the Rules of Procedure. It goes without saying that I am always ready to accept the convictions of others when it comes to procedural issues. When I hear though, as I do now, our esteemed Chairman of the Socialist group demanding a paper vote and claiming that to be the only correct form of secret ballot, I would like to refer, Mr President, to your initial statement to the effect that an electronic ballot is a secret ballot and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. If we now want to decide whether we are to vote electronically or with ballot papers – and I approach the issue very even-handedly, readily conceding that one can take one view or the other – then you must let us decide by show of hands, a simple Yes or No, on how we are to vote. That is the only way to resolve this procedural issue. I would recommend that we now decide in that way, and democratically, how we want to cast our votes. (Applause)

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have arrived in Parliament at a time when we are engaged in organising our work for the second half of this term. Our attainment of the great objectives of which you have spoken is dependent on technical on behalf of Europe. Our group warmly welcomes you to Parliament. You have yourself observed that you are here for the first time. We emphatically welcome the fact that you will be here in Parliament on three occasions as President-in-Office of the Council and as Prime Minister of Spain to give an account of the decisions reached under your Presidency. We are grateful to you for that, and we hope that all following Presidencies will learn from your example. We also, though, expect greater transparency in the Council of Ministers and ask of you that the report the Council is now drafting should also lead to real results, making an important step forward towards greater transparency in the Council of Ministers possible under your Presidency. You have spoken, too, about terrorism, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with you. There is no such thing as good and bad terrorism. There is only terrorism, and we must say loud and clear that wherever people are deliberately being killed, whether by ETA in Spain, whether on 11 September, whether in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world, it must be countered by decisive protest from us, and we must combat terrorism with the utmost determination and make democracy and the rule of law the foundation of relations between peoples and people. (Applause)
 I very much welcomed your reference to Russia, Mr President-in-Office. Whilst needing good relations with Russia, we are aware that there are at present the gravest abuses of human rights taking place in Chechnya. As Christian and European democrats, we declare that the life of a peaceful Muslim in Chechnya or anywhere else in the world is of the same value as the life of a Christian or a non-Christian in the West. We must defend human dignity throughout the world. (Applause)
 You have also spoken about the euro, and we support what you have said. Let us, in this hour of joy over the euro, which the President of the Commission has described as a gigantic project, let us remember – for the euro has many parents, indeed only too many fathers – that it was people such as Helmut Kohl, the Honorary Citizen of Europe, François Mitterrand and Jacques Delors, who, with the support of others, advanced this great project in those days. I would like also to invoke the name of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, the chairman of the Convention, who, with Helmut Schmidt and others in the Seventies, prepared the way for the European Monetary System. I congratulate you on your choice of him. What now matters is that we pursue a policy of stability, for things are changing. I recall how friends in my party looked at Italy before the introduction of the euro, doubted whether Italy should join the common currency and wondered whether policies of stability were really pursued there. I do not want to single out any one country, but all of what we hear today from Italy indicates that the countries in which Italy was formerly criticised could rightly have the same criticism levelled at them today, as they have not been doing what is needed for the stability of the European currency. So let there be restructuring of the budget! We must consolidate Europe as an economic base, which means that it is the small and medium-sized enterprises that we must promote by means of a sensible and moderate fiscal policy, something we strongly support. In order that we might go in the same direction, we need coordination in economic policy and in stability policy – coordination rather than harmonisation. Mr President-in-Office, I very much welcome what you had to say about the Convention. We will quite happily offer the use of our group's meeting room – another great group has met there before, so they may well agree to the offer – but the spirit of our meeting room is today particularly well suited to working on the European project. I have something to ask of you, Mr President-in-Office. It is with great joy that we have heard that our colleague, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and one-time President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, has been appointed by the government of Luxembourg, that is, by Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, as Luxembourg's representative to the Convention. (Applause)
 We ask you most sincerely to exert your influence as President-in-Office of the Council so that all governments send personalities to this Convention whose words carry weight in the national capitals and governments, so that what is decided in the Convention may also have something of a cohesive effect on the national governments in the countries of the European Union. Let me turn to a final aspect, namely enlargement and the Mediterranean dialogue. We are right alongside you as far as the timing for 2002 and the conclusion of the first accession treaties is concerned. Our Group has decided that observers should be sent as soon as possible to the European Parliament from the countries with which the treaties are to be signed – observers who would pass on information to these countries until the European elections, when representatives from these countries will sit as equals in the European Parliament. We strongly support you in the Mediterranean dialogue. We must ensure that people in the countries along the Mediterranean that do not belong to the European Union have a chance and prospects in their own country – in Morocco, in Algeria, everywhere, even in the Arab countries – and do not all come to us. We must help them in this, and I very much welcome the initiatives of the Spanish Presidency. We wish you every success on your way. There will always be a warm welcome for you from us in Parliament. If you meet with success, then it is a success for us all, for the Council Presidency, for Parliament, for the Commission and for the European Union that we share. Great success for you personally, but also for your presidency. (Applause)

 Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 15 January 2002 is an important day in the history of the European Parliament. We have elected a new President, and I should like, Mr President, to congratulate you most warmly on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats. (Applause)
 I shall say something about the candidates in a moment, but I would ask the other groups to understand when I say that there have been many who doubted that it was possible to elect an MEP from a small country or the chairman of one of the smaller groups as President of the European Parliament. I should like to say to you, Mr President, and to everyone else too, that I am very grateful for the fact that the opportunity was given – and to our own group, too – to raise the profile of our European culture, and for the fact that a small political group and a small country also have the chance to take over one of the most important tasks in the European Union. (Applause)
 Europe would be a poor continent if the practice were only to give the responsible positions to people from the ‘larger’ countries. When everyone is given an opportunity and when a figure from Ireland, such as yourself, can become President of the European Parliament and our much-respected colleague, Mr Santer, from Luxembourg, can become President of the European Commission, then Europe is a continent that respects the dignity of all people and all Europeans. This, I believe, is the message today. We are giving new expression to the fact that Europe is not governed by the few, but that everyone has a voice, an influence and a portion of responsibility. In this task of yours, which you are now carrying out on behalf of the whole of the European Parliament, I wish you a lot of luck, Mr President, and much success when it comes to the common future of our ancient European continent that never ceases to renew itself. I should like briefly to acknowledge your fellow candidates, Mr Onesta, Mr Wurtz, Mr Bonde and, in particular too, Mr Martin. I well remember, Mr Martin, the discussion we had some years ago in Edinburgh, the capital of another small European nation, Scotland. That was many years ago and, at a time when I had no special responsibility here in Parliament, I became very aware then of the fact that it is a source of great enrichment, and also very necessary, that the groups in the European Parliament, despite their various political orientations, should be agreed and united on one goal, namely a peaceful and democratic future for our continent, based on the principle of liberty. I should therefore like, today too, to convey a sincere word of thanks and acknowledgement to all the candidates, in particular Mr Martin. (Applause)
 Allow me to say a final word. Mr President, this continent was divided. When many people, in both my own and other groups, were elected to this Parliament in 1979, no one would have dared to dream that, in a few years’ time, we should be able to welcome fellow MEPs from Central Europe here in the European Parliament. I should like to propose that, on the day that the accession agreements are signed with the first accession countries, we invite observers here to the European Parliament so that they might begin preparing these countries for the democratic elections to be held there in 2004. I wish you all the very best on behalf of our group. No one will mind my saying this today on behalf of the group of which I have the honour of being chairman, and I am also rather proud that we have kept our word. Trust too is important in politics. As I would also say to the other groups, our group will always be an ally of yours while the peaceful and democratic future of a strong and progressively more united Europe is at stake. I wish you much success in your work and God’s blessing upon it. (Applause)

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is the day for saying some very, very warm words of thanks to our President, Nicole Fontaine, who is from our group, for discharging her duties over the last two and a half years – as she herself has just said – with such passion. Madam President, you are one of a distinguished line which includes Louise Weiss and Simone Veil. Louise Weiss, Simone Veil and Nicole Fontaine: these are three great Presidents of our European Parliament. Today we ask ourselves the following question: what were the outstanding qualities of your Presidency? The first is that you have always put the concept of the Community, action by the European institutions, at the centre of your policy, and indeed you continue to do so; this means first and foremost the European Parliament, which you – and this is my second comment – have consistently represented with great dignity, both in public and at the summits. The fact that the Laeken photograph shows you between the King of Belgium and the President of the French Republic is testimony to your powers of persuasion. Thirdly – and here you were an example amongst so few – you spoke out against any form of terrorism, obviously in particular against the terrorism in Spain, but also throughout the world. Extending an invitation to Commander Massoud was one of your great decisions and in so doing you, as it were, anticipated subsequent events in Afghanistan. That is why we have every reason to thank you so warmly today! You were of course always a full Member of our group, even as President, but now, when you stand down as President in January, you will be coming back into the fold of our group and you will then take your seat alongside another former President of the European Parliament – whom we hold in equally high esteem – José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado. We will be delighted to have you, as well as Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, working alongside us on a day-to-day basis. We welcome you very warmly back into our group and we thank you most sincerely for your convincing work, our dear President, Nicole Fontaine. (Applause)

 Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there is a good atmosphere in today's sitting, which is fitting in this pre-Christmas season. We have thanked our President, but we must also warmly thank the Council Presidency, and here first and foremost Mr Verhofstadt, the Prime Minister, for the success which you, which Europe, and all of us, achieved in Laeken with the adoption of the Laeken Declaration. Mr President-in-Office, you – and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Michel, whom I should like to include in these words of thanks – have acted in the best Belgian tradition, as your predecessors – Leo Tindemans, who will be 80 years old in just a few months' time, Wilfried Martens, the President of the European People's Party, and Jean-Luc Dehaene – also consistently did: with commitment, conviction and in the European spirit. This is also an example of how the government of a so-called smaller country can sometimes operate far more effectively and move Europe much further forward than so-called larger countries always claim to be capable of doing. (Applause)
 That is why I should like to thank you most sincerely. I should like to limit my comments to the Laeken Declaration, because many colleagues from our group will be addressing the other issues. Laeken is a great personal success for you, Prime Minister, and we very much welcome this. I should, however, also like to thank the Commission very much. After all, from time to time we do also express criticism of the Commission, even if it considers this to be unjustified. The President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, with the Member of the Commission responsible for reforming the European Union, Michel Barnier, at his side, have not only constantly monitored our progress along the road to reform, they have also trodden the road with us. It was our party, the European People's Party, which proposed at its Congress in Berlin as early as January that a Convention be convened. We are glad that this is the position of the European Parliament as a whole and also that of the most important institutions. What is most significant, in my view, is our new working method, the fact that the reform of the European Union is being made into a parliamentary process. A majority of the Convention are members of parliament, and we hope that this will also mean that the media will contribute to actually making our work public, because it is all very well to hold public meetings, but this is not of course sufficient on its own; it is only effective if the media cover these meetings so that the public has access to them, and this is a request which we wish to make of the media today. There has been some debate over this tripartite chairmanship which has been created for the Convention. May I say, Mr President-in-Office, that I consider this to be a very wise move. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing was of course not only the French President, he was also a Member of the European Parliament, and in the end a Member of our group. At one time he was a Member of the Liberal Group but he subsequently came to us, which was of course a step up,... (Laughter)
 ... and above all he did something which does not come at all easily to a former French President; he wrote a report on subsidiarity. I say to you: it is better to have a chairman who is a little advanced in age and who has an alert, keen mind and an open European heart, than a young chairman who is a Euro-sceptic! That is why I think that this appointment, complemented by the appointments of Jean-Luc Dehaene, with whom we as a group have excellent relations, and also Giuliano Amato, who is a proven European, is a very sound one. There will be nine further members of the praesidium and I would have thought that the two European Parliament representatives would be drawn from the two large groups. It is precisely because this will probably be the case that I firmly believe that it would provide a good counterbalance if the next President of the European Parliament were to come from a smaller group, and that is why our group will be giving its full support to Pat Cox, the Chairman of the Liberal Group. (Laughter and applause from the right, protests and heckling from the left)
 Ladies and gentlemen, obviously this is still open for discussion and the final decision remains to be made, but I am fairly optimistic in this regard. As far as content goes, Mr President-in-Office, I thought it was very astute of you to pose questions. I do not wish to give our answers to these questions now. Issues included strengthening Parliament, Parliament's right of codecision, more openness, transparency in the Council of Ministers and obviously a role for the Commission which is based on the will of the electorate. This will all have to be negotiated. Another crucial factor is how the work of the Convention is structured, and I think that with our 16 representatives we in the European Parliament have a tremendous opportunity to be, as it were, in the vanguard here. I have just proposed to our group that our family of parties – I do not know how the other groups do this – meet together as a group, as befits a parliamentary process, that our Convention members from the EPP/ED Group and the members of the national parliaments meet together to do some preparatory work in an appropriate setting. I would call on the fifteen governments to send their best people to the Convention. These must not be people who think that they will be taking part in a seminar; the governments need to be represented by personalities who also have the ear of their government. If the Chairman, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, is supposed, pursuant to the Laeken Declaration, to report back to the Heads of State and Government at each summit, then it would only be sensible to introduce a similar reporting requirement for the national government representatives. They should report back to their respective national governments, thus ensuring that the Convention does not work in isolation and that constant feedback is provided. Whether this Laeken Declaration ultimately merits the epithet 'historic' – it is a good start, but unless the working method proves to be effective the result will not be either – whether all of this is ultimately of historic significance will of course only be known once the result is on the table and the Heads of State and Government and their governments have adopted it. I hope that their commitment to the process, as expressed through government representatives and parliamentary colleagues, whether from the European Parliament or national parliaments, is so strong that the result can also by and large be accepted. If we achieve this together then this European Union, our venerable Europe, which will then be renewed, will be capable of acting both internally and externally; it will be a democratic, convincing Europe which is representative of our values. (Applause)

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is not really all that common for the political group chairmen to express praise and appreciation. Normally, if we praise someone and express our appreciation for anyone, it is for the President of this Parliament. We often have occasion to express our thanks and praise for her. However, today I would like to say a word of appreciation to the Council, and to you, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, for being here today for the first time, as our President has just said. Last time round I was critical because the Council was not represented. If the Council pursues a good policy, even if it concerns working methods, then that deserves our appreciation. You are a Belgian; you represent the Belgian Presidency. I would like to thank you very sincerely on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats not only for being here today, but also for the committed way you have worked during your presidency. (Applause)
 I would now like to address the President of the Commission. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have a very high regard for the President of the Commission, for his personal integrity and for his positive attitude. However, if we want to achieve joint successes, these successes have to be based on truthfulness and on sensible working methods and structures. Mr Prodi, you know of course that the political groups in the European Parliament prepare each part-session here in Strasbourg by means of their work in group meetings in Brussels. Many members of my group said last week in Brussels, when we were doing our preparatory work, that the 2002 work programme was on the agenda, but where was the document that we could have used to prepare for this debate in Strasbourg? Many members were in favour of striking this debate from the agenda. Mr Prodi, I have to tell you that this should not happen again, we must never again find ourselves without a working document for such an important debate. I would ask you to ensure in future – and this is not just your task as President but rather one for the Commission as a whole, and for your staff – that documents are made available in good time and that the European Parliament is treated seriously, so that we can work in a reasonable way, which is in both our interest and yours. (Applause)
 Reasonable working methods are essential if we are to succeed here. If we do not have reasonable working methods and structures, we do not have any chance of succeeding. We want to work towards joint success because we are firmly convinced that the Commission and this House, as committed advocates of the Community method, need to work towards the same goals. So if you have any colleagues who do not take Parliament so seriously, it is therefore in their own interest to consider whether working methods should not be restructured in their field. We are not just offering you and your fellow Commissioners a hand; we also need a sensible form of cooperation if we are to achieve joint successes. For that reason, relations between Parliament and the Commission need to be in good order. That is something that you want as well, but in that case the fine words that we certainly appreciate also need to be matched by specific practical action when it comes to cooperation. A programme like the one we have before us deserves to be supported by all the Members of the Commission, and indeed we have five Members of the Commission with us today, which is more than usual, but this programme covers all areas of work in 2002. You yourself said that you are effectively the European government, an idea with which we in our group have a great deal of sympathy. However, if you are effectively the European government, then the whole government should be here, with all your Members. I would very much welcome it if that were the case next time. Mr President of the Commission, when we are setting our agenda during the meeting of political group chairmen, we often hear that Commissioner A, B or C cannot be here in Strasbourg at such and such a time. I really must urge you, given that we are only talking about four days each month – Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday – to ensure that all Members of the Commission keep those days free. If Parliament asks for Commissioners to be here, then they should come, and the excuse that they have other commitments is not acceptable. Parliament should have priority over any other commitments the Commission may have. There are of course exceptions – I say that because I see Commissioner Lamy is with us – when there are major world conferences on the international calendar, such as the Doha Conference, which Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler of course have to attend. We are not insisting on this point 100%, but basically speaking Parliament must have priority over other Commission activities. If I may now turn to the substance of the programme, Mr President of the Commission, we largely support what you have said. We are in agreement, and for that reason we should cooperate sensibly and effectively. We now expect, like you, that next weekend in Laeken the Heads of State and Government will give the Convention an ambitious mandate so as to achieve a really positive reform of the EU institutions. We recommend that an early start should be made on this work, at the end of February or the beginning of March, so that the Convention can be concluded at the end of 2003 under the Italian Presidency. We also support what you have said about enlargement. Up to 10 new countries could be included in the first round. This is not the time to say which those countries will be. However, we do not agree with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs when he says that we should accept all the Central European countries, as when we make a decision on this in autumn 2002, we can only accept those countries which meet the conditions. Those countries that do not meet the conditions cannot yet expect to join the European Union. It is not acceptable for countries like Hungary to have to wait because other countries are not yet ready. Those countries that do meet the conditions should not be held back because other countries are not yet ready, and we hope that the decisions made at that point will be the right ones. We also fully support your comments about the Mediterranean region. We need to work with great commitment under the Barcelona Process, which is becoming ever more urgent and involves an ever greater contribution to stability. You mentioned how important stability is for us if we want to make Europe truly competitive, because it is not enough for us simply to declare that the European Union is to become the most competitive area in the world. We also have to take the necessary structural measures, and that means in particular strengthening Europe as a location for investment. There should not just be tax incentives for major corporations, but also for medium-sized companies, so that they too can invest, and when investments are made that leads to the creation of jobs. I shall wind up now, Madam President. We have an ambitious programme, we support the Commission and we call on the Commission and the Council for us all to work together, as there should not be any competition between our various institutions, because we are all committed to the same Europe, and that is why the Commission, the Council and Parliament must each fulfil their own responsibilities. We are prepared to do so, and will support the other institutions when they do the same. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barón Crespo's comments demand a response. On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that we expect that the Italian government, in which we have the greatest confidence, will help to ensure that we can finally reach an agreement. We regard the fight against terrorism as a priority, and this is an issue on which there should not be any differences between the party-political families. However, Mr Barón Crespo, I also believe this not an issue that should be the subject of party-political controversy, and we also know – please listen to what I am saying, I am trying to be very objective – that no result has been achieved on the party statute. You also know that it was not those of my own political persuasion who contributed to this failure. I would ask you, just as you are critical in other cases, to be critical of your own party when results are not forthcoming, as in the case of the party statute. Your credibility would be greater if you applied the same yardsticks right across the political spectrum. (Applause from the right)

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the summit at Laeken can be an historic one. Our group has every faith in the Belgian Presidency, because Belgium has always been faithful to the ideal of European unification and, above all, because Belgium has always stood for the European Community approach. We, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do not want Europe to be governed by a few great nations, but, rather, we want Europeans to work together, we want the European Community approach, and so we wish you, Mr President-in-Office, great success. (Applause)
 Both you and the President of the Commission have spoken about the enlargement, and the memory is still fresh in my mind of a conference with the leaders of our related parties from the acceding countries, that is to say, from the countries desirous of joining the European Union. Following on the French foreign minister's highly misleading statements, we declare loud and clear that we must not give the impression that those who will be ready to sign the Treaties in the coming year will have to wait for the stragglers also to comply with the criteria. Each country must be judged on its own merits; it is on this basis that we must proceed with the enlargement of the European Union. At Laeken, you will no doubt be considering Afghanistan, which is indeed necessary, and we repeat that it is necessary to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist networks. Now, though, we must also create the basis on which the international community, comprising the European Union, the USA, and the Arab and Muslim world, will now help Afghanistan to rebuild itself, making it possible for a humane society to come into being there, with a government in Kabul that respects human rights, including the rights of women. It is that task that is before us in the days and weeks ahead. I would like to comment on the Middle East. We urge all the parties involved to return to the negotiating table. I am being very restrained in my use of language when I say that we greatly regret the way that the Prime Minister of Israel behaved towards the visitors from the European Union. These were Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, Mr Michel, the Foreign Minister and Council President and also Mr Solana, the High Representative. We have no patience with the way that the Israeli Prime Minister treated our delegation to Israel – and I can remember some of Israel's great Prime Ministers, such as Ben Gurion, Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin. (Applause)
 We encourage the Commission and the Council to keep to the course they have set. We will always defend Israel's security, as we have always done in the past, but the people in Palestine are as much entitled to human dignity and a life lived in security, as are the Israelis, who rightly lay claim to that for themselves. (Applause)
 Let me make another comment on the Convention. We have high hopes for what you will be deciding at Laeken. The composition of the Convention is, numerically at least, well-known. I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to use all your influence to ensure that the fifteen government representatives are the sort of people who will work together in the Convention and will feel themselves bound by whatever proposal for a decision results from it, so that the governments, too, will be made to discharge their duties with regard to what the Convention brings into existence. For the Convention is not some kind of seminar, so – if, at the end of it, we are to be able to say more than just Yes or No, and I know perfectly well that the governments want that to be the case – the Convention must come up with something so convincing that it will be binding on the governments. Our group will, in any case, be sending its best and most experienced people to the Convention, so that we can achieve a real result. We also echo President Prodi's demand and beg you to make your influence felt in order to make it possible for the Convention to start as early as possible in 2002 – in February or early March under the Spanish Presidency – and then be concluded under the Italian Presidency at the end of 2003, giving us, by then, a new Treaty ready for signature, on which we can then have very comprehensive and repeated discussions here in Parliament. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what I am saying reflects my profound conviction that Laeken is such an important summit precisely because it will be about the future direction of our European Union, about whether we carry on the way we did at the mini-summit in London, with seven countries taking part, eight countries not taking part, and the European Commission not even present, that is not how we envisage Europe. On the contrary, Europe is for us the European Community. It is our wish that you, the Council Presidency and the Commission make Laeken an expression of this Community, and if you do that, you will have our entire support. (Applause)

 Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the day before yesterday, an aeroplane crashed over New York, and once again, we all held our breath because we were afraid that it was another terrorist attack. Thankfully, it was not an act of terrorism, although it was a truly horrific incident. However, Monday's fears show that terrorism is affecting our lives and that we cannot simply continue with ‘business as usual’. We must therefore make it clear that we regard terrorism as an enormous challenge, an intellectual, political, economic and, indeed, a military challenge. I welcome your comments, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. They tie in precisely with the keywords which I have written in my notes: we must dismantle the terrorist networks. This is the task now being undertaken in Afghanistan. We have all seen the pictures, which show the joy on people's faces in Kabul but also the dead bodies, obviously the victims of massacres. We therefore appeal to the Northern Alliance, which was led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, a responsible leader whom we welcomed here in April, to conduct itself in Afghanistan and in Kabul in a way which demonstrates that it is a good representative, also for human dignity and a better future for this suffering country. What we now need, and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council on this point, is action from the United Nations. I welcome the fact that our American friends are involving the United Nations in this way. However, what we also need, and the European Union must play a key role here, is an alliance, a coalition for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. We must not repeat the mistake of the 1980s and 1990s, when we left Afghanistan to fend for itself. We must give Afghanistan our help. The European Union's role throughout this conflict, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has been rather pathetic. Of course, the military issues are primarily national issues. We are not yet at the point where we, Europeans, can genuinely take on a joint role. However, I am extremely embarrassed by the conduct of some of the European Union countries over recent weeks. First of all, there was a tripartite meeting during the informal summit in Ghent, and then there was the meeting in London. I must say that I found this embarrassing. We do not have any self-appointed chiefs within the European Union; we have a European Union with a Council Presidency and a Commission. In London, the representatives, even the President-in-Office of the Council, invited themselves, and I found that especially embarrassing. Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and the Belgian Presidency attended the meeting in London; Greece, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark did not. I would have expected the Belgian Presidency, which I hold in high esteem, especially the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, to protest about this meeting, as it should have been the presidency's task to invite Member States to a meeting of this kind instead of having to request an invitation to go to London. I hope that different procedures will be adopted in future and that this kind of division within the European Union will not happen again. Of course, we have to learn from our mistakes. I hope that we will learn from these mistakes as well. From our group's point of view, it is essential that we act jointly, not only at the level of intergovernmental cooperation. We want joint action from Europe, and we expect resolute and courageous action from the Council Presidency in this context too. We will support the Council Presidency if it responds in this way, and we will also support the Commission. Mr Busquin, I call upon the Commission, its President and all its members: please make Europe's voice heard! The Commission must get involved; it must state its opinion, and it must not simply accept what we have witnessed in recent weeks and months. We have a chance if we take this resolute stance, and I can say on behalf of our group that we will be resolute in our support for the Council Presidency and the Commission if the shared interests of the European Union are stated clearly. We call on you to take this action. If you do so, you can be sure of our support. (Applause)

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I have, of course, some questions, but a few statements are in order. Let me say first, Mr President of the Commission, that we are glad to see you here. We were, though, somewhat astonished to see your name appear on the monitor during our bureau meeting. It took us by surprise, which may have been a mistake by our group. We do, of course, make mistakes, but in general, according to what I hear around the place, it was not known that the President of the Commission was going to be here this afternoon. We are glad that you are here, even though we would have liked prior notice. A second point, to which I would also like an answer, is that I was told this morning while the Group Chairmen were holding press conferences, that Mr Verheugen had also held a press conference. I would be very interested to know, Commissioner, whether it was on the subject to which you have just been speaking. If you can shed some light on that, then so much the better. Now for my questions. First, let me inform you that our group's leaders had a meeting in Hungary last week. There was grave concern in Hungary that the enlargement could, for them, be delayed if in another country, namely Poland, developments were not proceeding as quickly as might be wished. Of course, we all want Poland to be in the first round of enlargement, but a consequence of that must not be that, if a Member country is not yet ready, the others have to wait and we cannot keep to the 2004 deadline. Each country must be assessed on its own merits if enlargement is to be able to take place at all. I would be obliged if you could say something about this. I then have a very specific question. There was also disquiet in Hungary about the critical judgment passed on the 'status law' on Hungarians in other countries. This law was adopted by 95% of the Hungarian Parliament, and a commission of the European Council, the so-called Venice Commission, explicitly stated that this law was acceptable. One last question: How do you see the overcoming of the past with reference to some EU countries today? I am thinking of the Benes decrees and of the acquisition of land in Poland, for example. Can you say something more about that? Can we take as our starting point statements which, if these countries join the European Union, will make it possible for them to have a future with a clear record, which we of course very much want? We want the 2004 deadline to be adhered to, so that these peoples can take part in the next European elections.

 Mr President, as I have only two minutes, please allow me to combine what I have to say about the Regulation and the directive, as I have essentially the same things to say about each of them. What happened with the European Limited Company has happened in exactly the same way with the European Cooperative Society; the Council of Ministers has, quite out of hand, robbed us of our power of codecision. This is something that we must not tolerate. There is little doubt that the majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market takes the view that, this time, we should appeal to the Court of Justice against the choice of the legal basis. My original agreement with Mrs Gebhardt was that the Committee on Legal Affairs would restrict itself to amendments on the legal basis. We now have an array of amendments to vote on, both to the Regulation and to the directive. I gather that the Commission intends to support the amendments to the directive, whilst rejecting those to the Regulation. I take the same view. The legal issue is, however, a topic of great importance in terms of the future, for one cannot exclude the possibility of the Council of Ministers doing the same thing in other areas of company law – the other types of company are waiting to be dealt with. As far as the Regulation is concerned, we share the view expressed by the Commission, that Article 95 is the proper legal basis. We have already heard that a number of times, but, with reference to the directive on the involvement of employees, I would like to go into further detail. Article 137 (1) (e) is the rule on jurisdiction for informing and consulting employees and provides for no exception to the co-determination procedure in Article 251. Article 137 (1) (f), however, is the rule on jurisdiction for employee participation; it requires a unanimous vote in the Council, with Parliament merely being required to be consulted. In this instance, however, the Council can decide by unanimous vote to apply the codecision procedure. This directive treats both objectives – co-determination and consultation – equally. It is my contention that, in a situation like this, where there are two equivalent legal bases alongside each other, option is downgraded to obligation and the Council’s discretion is correspondingly limited. If this were not so, the requirement for unanimity in the Council as regards the one legal basis would nullify the codecision procedure in its equivalent counterpart. Such a curtailment of the European Parliament’s rights as a legislature enjoying democratic legitimacy is unacceptable. An appeal will not put the European Cooperative Society at risk. Firstly, the validity of the Cooperative Society Regulation is coupled to the expiry of the time limit for the transposition of the directive. This period should in fact allow sufficient leeway for the ECJ to hand down a clarificatory ruling. Secondly, the ECJ can be asked to rule that the Regulation and the directive continue to have legal effect. Quite deliberately, then, it is the choice of legal basis that is being contested, not the subject-matter of either the Regulation or the directive.

 Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to apologise for my late arrival. The car that was supposed to collect me came half an hour later than arranged. That is why I unfortunately only heard part of your speech. However, I grasped the main points. Commissioner, the committee and indeed Parliament has not raised this matter lightly or for fun, but because we do not believe that the NERA study, on which you are relying, actually provides a solid enough basis on which to make decisions of this kind. In other words, our main premise is that it has been proved, without the need for a NERA study, that these goods – which are everyday items, which every woman and every man buys, in particular those from the poorer sections of the population – for example jeans, shirts, polo shirts, trainers and suchlike, are being offered for sale outside the EU by the same brand manufacturers at the same quality standards for half the price or even less. That is one of the reasons. The second reason is that in our view the purpose of trademark law is not to seal off markets, allowing there to be different price systems inside and outside the EU, especially more expensive prices inside the EU and more reasonable ones outside; rather we are of the opinion that this is a matter for competition and not trademark law. The function of trademark law is to name, describe and unambiguously classify the manufacturer, the brand and the product and to confer certain rights on the trademark holder. These rights are justified and we will do all we can to defend them. A completely different, separate issue is, however, that of exhaustion. In Germany, for around 100 years from the advent of trademarks we had international exhaustion. With this system of international exhaustion in place we in Germany achieved the economic miracle, significant growth and much more besides. In the last five years, since European trademark law has come in, we have observed a system of dual pricing, and we have observed that trademark law has become a preferred option for companies because it is far easier to assert your rights under trademark law than it is under other rights procedures, which are actually product-related, such as rights relating to design, patent and copyright; it is more difficult to present your case here. That alone is the reason and trademark law cannot after all be stronger than competition law. That is why we asked these questions. That is why we have asked you in the Commission not to rely on a NERA study but to conduct your own investigations into these specific matters and to answer on that basis. Finally there is another question that has arisen since our past discussions on trademark law: what about trade on the Internet? There is of course nothing wrong with the Internet. We promote it. If someone outside the EU makes a purchase and the dealer dispatches the goods in the EU then this contradicts current trademark law. This cannot be the intention of trademark law either. Once again then we would urgently request the Commission to conduct further investigations into these few points and to inform Parliament of the result, and not to refer to a NERA study which in our view does not address these problems.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 11 October the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted my opinion on the White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy. Harmonisation of chemicals policy across the EU is especially important, but the following three aspects are no less significant. First, the practicability of the registration system. The amount of data to be collected means we must keep a sense of proportion in order that the system is not congested from the start. The principle of proportionality is also to be applied to the required definition of use, so that the manufacturer of a product must be able to restrict the definition to actually intended purposes. Secondly, a clear definition of the substitution principle. The definition of this principle varies from one Member State to another, if they have one at all. If it is to be laid down in Community law, it will have to be formulated in a consistent and unambiguous way. Thirdly, appropriate protection for test data. Insufficient account is taken of the need to guard commercial confidentiality. At the same time, the security data document should be under copyright in order to protect the applicant against misuse of the data obtained. Mrs Schörling's report is to that extent unbalanced. It takes too little account of the interests of medium-sized chemical businesses and of the industry as a whole, something that can lead to distortions in competition. I therefore recommend adoption of the amendments resulting from the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which contribute to a better balance of the interests of all interested parties.

 Madam President, I would like briefly to outline the underlying issues and the main points of my report. The central statement is that the Commission is called upon to produce a detailed study of the possible implications of the transition to the principle of international exhaustion by 31 December 2002. The Nera study presented by the Commission in 1999 fails to deal with this matter adequately. A trade mark right has its effects only in the territory for which it was granted. Community exhaustion applies to the Community mark and national marks when the holder of the right has put his product into circulation in the Community for the first time. If the holder of the trade mark right puts his product into circulation outside the Community, the legal effects of the marks are not exhausted in the Community. He can therefore prevent parallel importers from importing the product into the Community. Because of the current Community-wide exhaustion regime he can therefore quote two different prices: a lower one for countries outside the Community and a higher one for the Community itself. This split pricing policy, however, is not what the trade mark right is about. The main purpose of the mark is to make the product distinguishable and familiar and to indicate a certain product quality. We could also speak about the advertising effect. The division of markets to the disadvantage of consumers in the Community cannot be the objective of granting a Community trade mark. Neither is there anything in competition law to argue against parallel imports. So why should it be possible to use trade mark rights to prevent them? There is something wrong there. We must do something to get back to more competition and lower prices for branded goods. The same conclusion was reached in a study by the Swedish competition authority, as, too, did a discussion paper by the Irish competition authority. A hearing before a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was also presented predominantly with arguments in favour of international exhaustion. There is now an important new factor: the increasing amount of trade on the Internet. The present exhaustion regime could hamper the development of e
-commerce. It is not in fact certain whether Internet sales with the subsequent dispatch of branded goods are permissible under trade mark law. But legal certainty and consumer protection are essential conditions for the development of trade over the Internet. Then there are the following points. There are a) trade marks that are not really matched to any particular product. For example, you order ‘a Siemens’. ‘A Siemens’ can be a lamp, a washing machine or a nuclear power station. There are b) also trade marks that designate group products, for example Adidas shoes, whether they are sandals or high heels. There are c) trade marks that require absolute identity, in medicine for example. It cannot be even one milligram different from what the mark designates. All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study. Such a study must also draw comparisons with the world’s major trading nations and study and make a precise analysis of the implications for the EU labour market.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of creating a European form of company obeying the same supranational rules in all Member States is almost as old as the European Union itself. The Societas Europaea
 (SE) is the flagship of European company law. The academic foundations were laid in the late 1950s. In 1970, the Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation on the statute of an SE. It contained uniform law down to the last detail. In 1989, the Commission submitted an entirely new proposal for a regulation which excluded social and labour law, fiscal law, law on competition, protection of industrial property rights, insolvency law and industrial constitution law. Finally in Nice, political agreement was reached on a Council regulation on the statute and on a directive on worker participation. As regards the legal base: the 1989 proposal was based on the present Article 95 which establishes the right of co-decision. The Nice proposals are based on Article 308 whereby Parliament would simply be consulted. Article 95 is just as appropriate a legal base for the regulation as Article 308. For the purposes of democratic legitimacy – and in line with decisions of the Court of Justice – the legal base giving Parliament most say should be chosen in such a case. Consequently, Parliament reserves the right, following adoption by the Council, to bring a case before the Court to examine the legal base. As regards the regulation: pursuant to Articles 2 and 3, there are different ways in which an SE can be established. The capital of the SE must be at least EUR 120 000. There are two different systems of managing limited liability companies under the company law of the Member States. The 'single' system in Britain, for example, provides solely for an administrative body. The 'dual' system, applicable in Germany, for example, provides for a supervisory body and a management body. European unification now requires that both systems be available in each country so that it is possible to choose freely between them. Hitherto, company law of the Member States has been such that national companies can only transfer their place of business if they are dissolved and re-formed in another Member State. With an SE, a transfer will not result in the company being dissolved or in a new legal entity being created. The growing together of what used to be separate markets means that we must finally create organisational forms which reflect the new situation in Europe. However, there are serious shortcomings in the structure of the SEs. SEs will differ from one Member State to another. There will not be one European SE, but an SE with French, Spanish or German features, for example. Furthermore, even within the same Member State a variety of different SEs will be created to cover various company features such as co-decision making. I consider it essential that, parallel to the entry into force of the regulation, accompanying fiscal rules should also be adopted. The precise nature of the SE will, naturally, be determined in part by fiscal legislation. To this end, the series of amendments from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is to be welcomed. In conclusion, I advocate launching the SE on its maiden voyage. This will show where repairs are still needed so that one day it will fulfil our hopes and become the flagship.

Mr President, I move that any member should be able to use the travel office to visit groups of visitors within a radius of 25 kilometres of the European Parliament at any time. At the moment we are only allowed to travel 20 kilometres, which equates to a 15 kilometre radius. That is too short, given the hundreds of kilometres which many groups travel in order to come here. Please could you take suitable action here. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a suitable occasion to raise a topical point: we all have groups of visitors and we are glad to see large numbers of the general public in the EU coming to see us and, as is the case here, attending part-sessions. We also know, however, that it is difficult to find a hotel for fifty visitors. That is why the visitors have to make do with hotels which are not in Strasbourg but in the surrounding area. Obviously we want to bring Europe closer to the people and foster personal discussions between the people in the Union and Members of Parliament. This is achieved on the one hand through their visit to the European Parliament and, on the other hand, by the Member going to see the visitors in their hotel and talking to them there. As Members we travel to Chile, to South Africa… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, it does indeed cause some confusion when two people have the same surname and not even the parliamentary staff are able to distinguish between them. Our post also gets mixed up sometimes for the same reason. Following the horrific events of the Second World War, the United Nations refloated the idea of setting up an international criminal court. Further impetus was given to this initiative by the violations of international law in Yugoslavia and the massacres in Rwanda. Some people are asking where the International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction compared with the courts which already exist. The ECJ in Luxembourg rules on the application and interpretation of the treaties of the European Union. The International Court of Justice in The Hague rules on international disputes. The International Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg passes judgement on violations by States of rights arising from the Human Rights Convention. The International Criminal Court is being set up for the four particularly serious crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression. Until now the United Nations has authorised special courts, for example the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the crimes committed in Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In the future, the International Criminal Court will send out a clear signal that perpetrators of any of these crimes will be prosecuted and punished. War criminals will no longer be able to hide behind the borders of sovereignty. The new Court is an important achievement for the international community which will allow it to close loopholes in criminal prosecution. I should therefore like to call on all of the Member States to ratify the Statute soon, and I would recommend adoption of the resolution.

 Mr President, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery‘s report addresses the problems that the Commission mentions in its report on how matters stand with regard to the application of provisions on residence rights. Yet, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery would like to see the scope of application of these residence rights extended to third-country nationals. The Committee on Petitions was asked to submit an opinion because it is a special committee that is directly concerned with the problems facing the general public. Unfortunately, there are still far too many infringements of the rights of EU citizens; I wholeheartedly agree on that score. Firstly, Member States are wavering when it comes to implementing Community law provisions on residence rights. In particular, subordinate authorities in the Member States are unfamiliar for the most part with the relevant provisions. Secondly, the problems associated with the recognition of diplomas are hugely restrictive. What use is the right of residence to me, if I do not have the right to exercise the profession I am trained in, in the host country? Thirdly, a failure to adapt the provisions on freedom of movement, and the social security rules, to the changing labour market, is causing problems. It is simply not acceptable that I could fail to be reimbursed for medical treatment abroad merely because I do not have the correct form. Mr President, we have provisions governing EU citizens’ right of residence in other Member States, but even now, they are not being fully applied. We are constantly hearing of cases where EU citizens are unable to reside in another Member State. Therefore, let us urge the EU Member States to implement the existing Community law provisions without delay, before 
we consider extending these rights to third-country nationals at any rate.
Mayer, Hans-Peter (PPE-DE

 – (DE)
 Mr President, the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions is a very special body. It receives complaints from citizens, as the two previous speakers rightly said, who believe their rights as EU citizens have been restricted. As draftsman of an opinion on the right of residence, I would like to make a few comments on the specific problems in this area. The free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through European integration. Since the Maastricht Treaty there is a general right of residence, provided the individual concerned has adequate means of subsistence and adequate health insurance protection. Freedom of movement and right of residence can be restricted only for reasons of law and order, security or health. Experience has shown the Committee on Petitions that in practice the right to freedom of movement comes up against a great many problems because: (a) Member State authorities are slow to transpose the rules of Community law, (b) problems arise with the recognition of diplomas and qualifications in the case of specific professions, (c) the rules on social security have not been standardised, e.g. complicated forms for the refund of medical costs. An analysis of Treaty infringement proceedings between 1996 and 1999 shows that in 97 cases there was a direct link between the petition and the Treaty infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice. Unfortunately, the Council often ignores the communications from the Committee on Petitions about serious violations of Community law by Member State authorities. That reflects a negative attitude towards the European citizens’ right of petition. In future the Council should devote the necessary attention to the rights of EU citizens.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only did the attack in Madrid kill many people, but it also undermined the sovereignty of a European state. The fact is that, twist it how you will, the terrorists obviously succeeded in influencing the sovereign decision of the Spanish electorate. Not least as a result, terrorists have intervened in Europe. I wonder whether Europeans have recognised the nature of this threat appropriately and are prepared to meet it. The reaction so far has been relatively weak. We have resurrected programmes that we have had ever since September 11, 2001, yet which have been only inadequately implemented. Recourse has been had to visionary ideas, such as setting up a European Secret Service, which could perhaps be considered in the distant future, but certainly does not address the real threat. Calls have been made for someone to be appointed to deal with this – pretty much the standard response to a European problem – and someone actually has been; Mr de Vries is a highly-esteemed man and a former Member of this House. What is important is not that he has been chosen, but rather the question of what powers he is to have. To this question, few answers have been given. The need of the moment would appear to be prevention, for which purpose the data available in Europe, for example on terrorists, should be gathered together. Although the national services possess a great deal of information, there is little willingness to share it at the European level. If Europe collaborates more closely and reliably in this area than it has so far done, it will now have an opportunity to defend itself against the terrorists in the long term and with impressive impact.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to draw your attention to the matters described by Mr Schulz and to endorse his request for the allegations to be examined immediately and the public and ourselves to be informed. Between 50 and 60 German MEPs have been maliciously accused of having wrongly drawn their daily allowance, allegations that I emphatically reject! The daily allowance is not remuneration for participation in the sessions. In addition to participating in the sessions, we all have innumerable other tasks to perform, which are not entered in any session schedule, and in order to be present for such works in Brussels or in Strasbourg daily allowances are needed to meet expenses. Accordingly, we cannot accept being defamed in this way. I once again emphatically reject the allegations. A Member of this House is exploiting his parliamentary rights in order to spy on colleagues in the most unworthy and disgusting way. (Applause)
 For this reason also, Mr President, I demand that these events be investigated immediately and that – as I have said – the public and we ourselves should be informed. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Wallström is wrong to say that she is implementing the Århus Convention; the reality of it is that her draft directive on access to courts goes much further than does Århus. Århus merely requires open access to administrative or, alternatively, judicial review proceedings; Commissioner Wallström seeks to lay down binding provisions on access to the courts in all the Member States, with all environmental organisations to be empowered to object to administrative decisions and to appeal against them, with provision also for interim legal protection. This is to apply to the whole body of environmental law, in other words, to the whole acquis 
defined in the Community as having to do with the protection or improvement of the environment, including human health and the protection or rational use of natural resources. The examples listed are, among others, water protection, noise protection, soil protection, atmospheric pollution, town and country planning, and biotechnologies. Environmental organisations are thus given a general right to contest and monitor the application of the law. That amounts to nothing more and nothing less than a system change in the implementation and control of the law as it stands in most of Europe’s Member States, with private bodies, in their guise as representatives of the public, being given the right to supervise the authorities. Our legal system knows nothing of the monitoring of law by any such body separate from the courts and from the competent authorities, and with good reason. Environmental associations are, at the end of the day, interest groups like any others, lacking democratic legitimacy and not bound by law and statute. Introducing and making binding such a dramatic extension of class action will have a massive effect on the economy and cannot under any circumstances be reconciled with the Lisbon objectives. It is for that reason that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has limited itself to saying that Århus must be implemented, but to a minimum standard, and if Member States want to go beyond that, then that is their decision. That is where the matter should rest, and so I can only hope, Commissioner Wallström, that the Council will firmly put a stop to your initiative.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission President began his statement this morning by saying that the Union is in a good state of health. What planet is he on? The Stability Pact, one of the foundations of our single currency, is in jeopardy, and the single currency is one of the pillars of this entire Union. With his extremely ill-considered description of the Pact as the ‘Stupidity Pact’, the Commission President has himself contributed to its derailment. Two major countries have blatantly departed from compliance with the Stability Pact’s rules. Regrettably, this includes my own country, which pushed for the launch of the Pact in the first place. How, and with what authority, does the Commission President intend to call these countries to order given that he himself has helped to undermine the Pact? What is the Commission President actually doing to counter the threat to the Pact which also emanates from the Convention’s draft? Who actually authorised the Convention to delete the goal of price stability from the catalogue of Union objectives? Price stability is the basis of the Union’s entire monetary constitution. In Germany, we lobbied for our public’s endorsement of the single currency and the phasing out of the Deutschmark by assuring them that price stability and the independence of the Central Bank would be guaranteed. We will feel cheated if the goal of price stability is now softened and price stability is put on the backburner. That is why, Mr Prodi, we expect you to give Commissioner Solbes your backing on this matter, not stab him in the back. As a second point, you mentioned the Lisbon strategy. In ten years’ time, we will supposedly be the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world. Is this anything more than empty words? Believe me, Mr President, you will need to change your legislative culture in more ways than one if we are to achieve this objective! (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can only look at the Intergovernmental Conference’s work so far with disquiet and concern. Imagine, a Convention that makes people smile – at any rate one that is not taken very seriously – manages, despite all political and geographical boundaries and the most disparate institutions from which it is drawn, to produce a convincing, well rounded draft constitution without having to take a vote on even one thing, and now we find that the Intergovernmental Conference tears that very same draft to shreds, unpicks it without giving the slightest hint about how it intends to reach a positive outcome. It is quite remarkable that none of the proposals discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference mark any step forward, but are all retrograde when compared with the Convention’s draft. The Intergovernmental Conference is in reverse gear. The Heads of State or Government are in the brakeman’s cab of the European Union. We are back in Nice again! The most astonishing statement came in fact from the finance ministers. They simply want to ‘governmentalise’ this Parliament’s budgetary powers. They want to deny Parliament any part in budget decisions. To which school did they go to learn the basics of democracy? (Applause)
 Do they not know that parliamentarianism is the pillar of democracy and that Parliament’s budgetary powers are the pillar of parliamentarianism? Not for the sake of its members’ powers, but for the sake of the democratic control that Parliament clearly must exercise. In making this proposal, the finance ministers are betraying a pre-democratic understanding of parliamentarianism. Incidentally, in this European Union the most costly favours have always been dispensed in ministerial meetings behind closed doors, not in this Parliament’s public budget debate. That is why Parliament must keep its budgetary powers. I want to set out just a few expectations that we have of the Intergovernmental Conference and address them to the Council Presidency, whose work up until now, which has certainly been very positive, we want to endorse. Firstly, we expect agreement to be reached by the end of this year. That is technically possible. There are not a vast number of articles to argue about, only a few key institutional issues. Secondly, the Intergovernmental Conference must put Nice behind it. The Heads of State or Government who took this Union down the blind alley of Nice must now bring it out again. Thirdly, a balance must be achieved between sometimes small-minded but basically legitimate national interests and the well-being of the European Community; in other words the Heads of State or Government must not only seek the good of their Member States, but they must also have and demonstrate a sense of responsibility for the unification of Europe, because what the Council devised in Nice is not only indefensible in democratic terms, but incomprehensible by any rational person. A new Treaty must be easy to understand; that is the only way to achieve the transparency and proximity to the citizens for which we are striving. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the developments we are currently witnessing in Iraq are, in some ways, reminiscent of what happened in the former Yugoslavia. Once the totalitarian regime that had suppressed them had been toppled, all internal forces were unleashed, sometimes violently. It is the same with Iraq. Under these circumstances, an ‘I told you so’ attitude or gloating is inappropriate and unwarranted; rather, the situation is something for us to be concerned about. A regime of criminals has been ousted and that is a good thing, and it was necessary, but we are certainly not on a direct road to peace, stability and the rule of law. That is why the Europeans need to play a part. In my view, it is not enough to point out to the Americans the obvious fact that they are incapable of restoring peace by military means alone. That is why Europe’s hour has come. We must provide help. It is our responsibility, and it is also in our interests to do so. I therefore want to say this to Commissioner Patten: he can count on the support of the CDU/CSU delegation in this House, both for his commitment and for the fact that we must put our money where our mouths are – for it will cost money. We will have to justify why we are spending the money. So let me say again: it is in our interests to make an effective contribution, together with the United Nations and, of course, with the United States of America and Great Britain, to support the road towards peace, stability and the rule of law in Iraq.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a new parliament is to be elected in Cambodia on 27 July, and some twenty political parties want to take part in this election. That is in itself an indication of some degree of progress towards democracy. At the end of the day, of course, what counts is the way in which these elections are conducted, as well as what happens before and after them, and whether the process is fair and deserves to be described as democratic. It is this that we have good reasons to doubt. Violence continues to overshadow the preparations for the election; opposition politicians are intimidated, two of them having been murdered in June alone. Everything demonstrates the total power wielded by the autocratic Communist Party, which evidently cannot reconcile itself to the idea that other parties have to exist. Rules on local elections are infringed, as a rule by the local authorities, and such breaches go unpunished. The quality of a democracy depends on freedom of access to the media, above all to the electronic media, something that is not guaranteed, not least because the latter continue to be under the control of the Cambodian People’s Party and the Prime Minister, Hun Sen, or of organisations and persons associated with it. The European Union is sending observers to monitor the Cambodian elections. To do so makes no sense unless they are able to do their work unhindered, and the country’s government must ensure that they are able to do so. By demanding all these things, we are not in some way illicitly interfering in the country’s internal affairs, but are acting on the basis of a cooperation agreement, Article 1 of which states in clear terms that respect for the principles of democracy and for basic human rights are among the elements of this agreement and that they must be adhered to by both parties. Since 1992, the European Union has been deeply involved in Cambodia. Having invested some EUR 250 million in the country, we can legitimately make certain demands as regards the fairness of elections. We therefore demand that the Cambodian Government should put an end to the violence and prevent the intimidation of opposition politicians and their parties. Our further demand of the Cambodian authorities is that they should ensure that these elections can be held freely and without interference. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without a doubt these six months of the Greek Presidency have been some of the most dramatic in the recent history of the European Union, and I think that we can compliment the Greek Presidency on doing its job with great sensitivity, consistency and energy. Three major issues have dominated this period as they do this debate: enlargement; the war in Iraq and the significance that it has had for Europe and will also continue to have in the future, and the Convention. Enlargement – the great historic project of our generation – is well on the way to being completed successfully. For us enlargement already has a human face, in the shape of the colleagues who are already working here as observers. As an aside, I should like to mention that we in Germany were interested to note that after Parliament's decision on enlargement the Czech Government for example issued a statement on the injustice of expulsion, which is along the right lines and gives us hope that here too the process of reconciliation may reach a successful conclusion. The war in Iraq made it clear where Europe's borders lie and showed where we need even more Community: primarily in the field of foreign and security policy. So far Europe has played no role at all here or at best a pitiful one. It really should strike people that where Europe uses the Community method, such as on internal market issues, we operate on an equal footing with for example the United States of America, but that where we work on an intergovernmental basis, we play no part at all. This has to change in the future and the Convention needs to make a contribution to achieving this. I hope that it will still succeed in doing so before 10 July of this year.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is willing to support the Vietnamese people in progressing towards a society in which democracy and the rule of law are the core principles. Vietnam has already made significant advances along this path which deserve to be recognised. Nonetheless, there are still some very worrying developments. The ASEAN delegation attended the AIPO General Assembly in Hanoi last year and was prepared to visit the Vietnamese authorities and parliamentary colleagues for talks. However, when we were denied access to religious leaders, we felt we had no option but to cut short the visit. That is precisely the point that we want to highlight. There are worrying restrictions on human rights, especially religious freedom. The issue of religious freedom has nothing to do with how Vietnam conducts matters of state. It is wrong to seek to define the exercise of religious freedom as a threat to national security. We are not interfering in Vietnam's internal affairs. Vietnam can decide for itself which path it wants to take. That is not our responsibility. However, there are fundamental and universal rights which are binding for all of us, and they include the right to practise a religion. There are eminent representatives of Vietnam who, for example, have been here in Europe, in the European Union, and now occupy key positions in the Vietnamese parliament. They know exactly what our positions are. They know that we have no desire to interfere in Vietnam's domestic decisions, and they know that we are prepared to provide help. However, we must insist that political and religious prisoners are released. That is what this House demands. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the generally accepted historical reasons for the enlargement of the European Union, another factor which has played an important part in our decision in favour of this initiative is that since the fall of the Iron Curtain there have been differences between the West and former Eastern Bloc countries in terms of prosperity, democracy and law and order which cannot be allowed to continue. We therefore have good reasons for working to ensure that prosperity and democracy also have a chance in those countries where that was impossible under Soviet dictatorship. With enlargement, we are pushing the boundary of prosperity and democracy further eastwards, so that the question once again arises, this time in the case of our new neighbours, of how we can live alongside them, and the Commission is to be congratulated on the way it has racked its brains to find solutions. I support all the activities described by the Commissioner down to the last detail – with one exception, where I am opposed. That is your suggestion, Mr Verheugen, that you can manage all this without making a statement about possible decisions on accession. On that particular point I think you are wrong. I think it is essential, while we are in the process of enlargement – a process that will keep us busy for a long time in fact – that we should spell out who is to be a neighbour in the future and who is to be a future Member State of the European Union. It is now absolutely imperative for us to address the issue of the borders of the European Union – and I do not just mean its geographical borders. The Treaty itself obliges us to address this issue, because, as the Commission communication correctly mentions, European states may apply for membership of the European Union. However, we need to consider how far the political union that we consider desirable can be extended, what the limits to integration are, what the shape of our future structures will be, and what the nature of the European Union must be. That is not something we can or should try to resolve conclusively today, but it is very much under discussion in the Convention. We do not need to resolve the conflict about whether the European Union is a federal state or some other kind of animal. In such cases we lawyers tend to talk about something being sui generis
. However, we do need to make a decision about who in future will be neighbours and who will be Member States, because on the one hand we owe the citizens of the European Union some clarity on this issue, as they want to know how far the European project now extends, but on the other hand we also owe clarity to our neighbours, whose hopes we should not raise if they cannot be fulfilled. That is one of the problems that we have with Turkey, which is an important partner and ally. The question of how to deal with Turkey has been left unresolved for too long. The objective of ‘political union’ also has its limits. The process of enlargement has now essentially reached a stage where there may still be some scope for ‘rounding off’, but any further accession that would jeopardise the Union's capacity for integration and totally undermine the balance between these 25 states has to be ruled out. Enlargement has reached a stage where to shape a common view by reconciling varying positions and conflicting standpoints would take so much energy that there would be no scope for effective external action. That is indeed one of the lessons of the Iraq war, where divergent viewpoints within the European Union condemned us to inaction. Who can seriously believe that the accession of countries ranging from the Mediterranean area through Turkey to Russia could possibly make the Union stronger and more effective? That is why we need to resolve the question of the borders of the European Union now, and only then can we try to act as good neighbours.

 Mr President, for me, as a German MEP, the reunification of Europe, for which we have voted today, is of comparable significance to the restoration of the unity of my own country. It is for that reason that I approved today's applications for accession with all my heart, including that of the Czech Republic. I do, however, profoundly regret the Czech Republic's failure to annul the expulsion decrees and, in particular, the Immunity Act, which is contrary to every principle of law. I have therefore declared my approval of the accession of the Czech Republic as well in the conviction that, if the Czech Republic becomes a Member State of the European Union, we will be able to represent better and more effectively the interests of the German expellees and of the German minority in the Czech Republic, to whom I feel a sense of obligation.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our resolutions become no more convincing the more self-righteously we belabour one another with judgments about what is wrong and what right. We should be helping to find ways out of the crisis. Firstly, the war must be brought to an end as speedily as possible, with the minimum possible damage being done to people, and Saddam Hussein and his criminal regime being disarmed. Secondly, the Iraqi people must then have the opportunity to take their own decisions, and the United Nations – rather than one of the belligerent parties – must assume responsibility for the reconstruction of the country. To this reconstruction, thirdly, the European Union must make a determined contribution, it being in its own primary interest that peaceful development should take root both in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. We are currently finding out how much we are affected when the opposite happens. Fourthly, we must reinvigorate the transatlantic partnership and rebuild a relationship of trust with the United States of America, which will, for the foreseeable future, remain the only power capable of guaranteeing order and security on a global and regional scale. All credit for that to the Americans, to whom we Germans owe a great deal, for they stood up for our freedom at a time when that freedom was menaced by Soviet Communism. Then their soldiers had the responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of our capital, Berlin. It is for those reasons that I am in solidarity with the United States, even though this solidarity has a critical edge to it from time to time. Solidarity of this sort is not to be abandoned out of hand when there are differences of opinion, for we see no alternatives to the Atlantic Alliance, any more than there are alternatives to European unification. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time for illusions is past, and now we must face reality. Saddam Hussein's criminal regime must be disarmed. That is what most of us in the House want, and to that the United Nations has committed itself in almost innumerable resolutions of its Security Council. Most of the indications are that it would not have been possible to disarm Saddam Hussein without the use of military means, whether another four, eight or twelve months had been spent attempting it. What matters now, therefore, is this war be brought to a speedy conclusion, sparing, if at all possible, those not actively involved in it. My sympathies today are with the soldiers who must come through this war, as well as with their families and with those who will be the victims and will have suffering to endure. I believe that one of the illusions that we must cast off is the role of the European Union. The part it has played in this crisis has been a lamentable one, for it has been divided and lacking any capacity for action and or any influence on the objectives it purportedly seeks to achieve. That is not the least reason why the European Union must, in the post-war period, undertake to make a substantial contribution towards enabling the people of Iraq to establish a state and a social order that are of their own choice and that is prepared to live at peace with the world. It is obvious, though, that the Europeans have failed. When will Europeans at last learn that the world will listen to them only when they speak with one voice? (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive presented by Commissioner Vitorino will be the foundational European draft law on immigration into Europe. In presenting it, he is taking a quite specifically systematic approach in generally opening up European labour markets to immigrants, whilst, by way of derogation, giving the Member States the option of taking their own absorption capacity into account and reducing the number of immigrants, right down to zero if need be. This is happening at a time when we have 15 million unemployed in Europe, and when, in my own country, the figure is nearing 5 million. Experts are unanimous in stating that this state of affairs will persist for years, so that we can say without further ado that Europe will not generally need more workers for many years to come. They are needed in certain sectors, in certain lines of business, in certain regions and on a temporary basis, but, in principle and in general, there is no need for them. What this means is that, in the event of this directive becoming law, there will be increased pressure on Europe's labour markets, to the detriment of those who are already unemployed, and not least to the detriment of the third-country nationals who are in the European Union legally and who, in any case, are more likely to be unemployed than are EU citizens. You are opening up this possibility if a position cannot be filled within four weeks. Last year in Germany, the average vacancy, in terms of the period of time elapsing between the job being advertised and somebody taking it, was around seventy days. This shows that the four-week period is absurdly short and will, as I have said, put our unemployed under much more pressure. The problematic thing about this system is that it involves a legal right, since, if an application is refused, the applicants are to be able to appeal to the national courts. We have already seen, to our horror, what happens when asylum-seekers make appeals of this sort, and so we do not want to repeat the experience with would-be immigrants. The report by the admirable Mrs Terrón i Cusí makes matters dramatically worse, as the majority on the committee went so far as to remove the regulatory element, the national right of control provided for by Commissioner Vitorino, so that all that is left is open access. Moreover, they have the idea that even illegal immigrants should also have the chance to apply for a work permit, which amounts to giving them a prize for getting in illegally, and one cannot sensibly support that either. The Council has been attempting to digest this draft since as long ago as July 2001. I am quite certain that the Terrón i Cusí report will end up in the Council's great big waste paper basket, and that Commissioner Vitorino, too, will have to make substantial changes to his draft if he wants it to stand a chance of getting the necessary majority. (Applause)
Nassauer (PPE-DE

 Mr President, for the purpose of correction, I refer to Amendment No 17, which amended Mr Vitorino's original draft to indicate that application may be made by anyone who ‘is legally present or already present there and has entered legally in order to reside there.’ The justification states that ‘individuals who are illegally present in the country should, however, also be offered the opportunity’ to obtain a contract of employment. That means that the application is to be made on the basis of illegality; even your own justification says so.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, the European Council in Copenhagen will decide to enlarge the European Union by adding to it eight countries of the former Eastern Bloc as well as Cyprus and Malta. This is the subject of negotiation and – necessarily – of occasional dispute, and haggling over one point or another, but nothing can conceal the fact that Europe, divided until 1989, is now, by taking this step, giving itself a new Community order, founded on the principle of democracy, the rule of law, freedom and the market economy. I am convinced that, of all the political events we have experienced, it is this one that will be the most important for all the generations now living. If some far-sighted person fifteen years ago had written out the agenda for this European Council, as it now is, complete with the reunification of Europe, he would have been thought to be deluded! If, at that time, we had been asked about our willingness to pay another EUR 2.3 billion for it, I am sure that we would have answered with a loud, clear and instantaneous ‘yes’. Sustained effort will be demanded of us if this enlargement is to be managed – politically as well as financially, of that there is no doubt – but this is the moment when this Union of ours is joined by ancient European lands, which belong with us in exactly the same way as France and Great Britain do, and will join us in standing up for the principles of freedom and democracy under the rule of law. The European Union is founded on the applicability of the law, and it is the acknowledgement of the law's applicability that alone holds it together. That is why it is so significant that Parliament, in a resolution on the report on the negotiations with the Czech Republic, described the so-called Exemption Act as incompatible with our conception of law, and did so in a careful and balanced way. This question is not just about German-Czech relations in the past, but also about Europe's present and future, as fundamental principles of law and their applicability are at stake, and it would certainly be helpful if the Czech Republic were to say something to clarify matters before enlargement. Now, my notes include a sentence, such as we have heard uttered so often already, to the effect that discussions on Turkey must not be allowed to dominate to some extent the enlargement summit, but I see that we ourselves have been unable to resist this temptation, so that may well be the way things are in Copenhagen as well, making it clear that this is something that people get worked up about. A few days ago, Commissioner Verheugen was quoted in a German newspaper as saying that he was against Turkey joining and that he proposed to the Turks the establishment of a special relationship as neighbours, a treaty that could also apply to other countries contiguous to the EU. I am sure, Commissioner Verheugen, that you will explain this as a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation and, quite rightly, point out that this represents a breach of the confidentiality you presumably agreed on. But this is not about you not being allowed to keep to yourself something that you want to have dealt with in confidence, but about the way this way of doing things encourages the impression that, on this issue, many are saying in public the opposite of what they actually think. Where Turkey is concerned, you would not be the only one, as a whole host of those who advocate its accession do not actually want it to join and are taking cover behind the criteria. That is a hypocritical way of going about things, and does more harm to the EU's relations with Turkey than it would to take stock of the situation with all the honesty that respect for this country requires. So, what we want is not offers of dates for accession, but greater honesty in our relations with Turkey! (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Patten has once again, and impressively, set out a convincing position by the European Union on the conflict in the Middle East, and I want to make some comments on it. I want to preface them by saying that I feel a sense of obligation to Israel, both to its people and to the state itself. That being understood, I want to ask my Israeli friends this: What will you have achieved if, as you are expected to do shortly, you withdraw your tanks from the Palestinian territories after killing many Palestinians, suspected assassins, murderers and potential murderers, after having destroyed many homes and schools, and wrecked the structure of the Palestinian Authority? Has that brought you even one millimetre closer to peace and security? Or is it not rather to be feared that your actions have begotten new hatred a thousand times over, a hatred that will explode at the next opportunity, be it in the Middle East or perhaps even here in Europe? I also want that question addressed to us ourselves, however. Have we really done enough to give us the right to make all the self-righteous demands of Israel that we hear in this House? Did those who went to Jenin also go to Jaffa, to meet the people who, at the feast of Passover, lost members of their families in the cruellest of ways when a bomb reduced everything to blood and broken bits? Is it not the case that Israel had already, and for many years, been a victim of Palestinian terrorism, long before Ariel Sharon had his crazy idea of marching onto Temple Mount as a provocation? Was what we did on such occasions enough? Is what we always do on such occasions enough? Adopting an urgent motion condemning terrorism whilst well aware that not one Palestinian would, even for a second, consider himself bound by it? Have we, then, done enough in this situation? Is it not the case that Arafat was never willing – and was probably not even in a position – to put a stop to terrorism? How do we justify the way we make substantial amounts of money available to the Palestinian Authority on a monthly basis? Do you know what happens to this money, Commissioner Schreyer? Have you ever checked up on it? Can you give Parliament evidence of it? How has the Commission responded to the documents that provide evidence to justify the suspicion that Arafat himself is involved in the financing of terrorism? Last week, a major German newspaper carried a report on a bloody terrorist attack in Jerusalem four years ago – long before the second intifada – which cost many innocent people their lives or their health. It describes how the pictures of the terrorists of that time are venerated in Palestinian schools as the images of heroes. Have we really done enough to contain the terrorism that is striking Israel now, as it has done for years? That is why I do not believe that it is enough to demand that the Israelis withdraw. There is no doubt that they have to do that, but that alone will not secure peace. It is not enough to condemn Palestinian terrorism while doing nothing more than deliver declarations on paper. There are many indications that the parties will not be in a position to free themselves from their mutual hatred, and that an international force will have to be deployed there. The European Union, too, must be an advocate for that. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister Sharon promised his people that he would create greater security and peace. In fact, his policies have lead to less security for Israel and less peace for the region as a whole. We in Europe too should criticise what Israel has done, because we should measure Israel by the yardsticks that we have in common, those of constitutionality and the protection of human rights. However, that statement should not obscure what this conflict is really all about. It is about the right to exist, the very principle of Israel's right to exist, and not about that of the neighbouring Arab states. One aspect of a secure existence is a life free from terror. The Israelis have always been denied the right to a life free from terror. Israel has constantly not only been threatened by terror, but terrorism has also been put into practice by organisations like Hamas and Jihad, who have been able to ply their bloody trade in the Palestinian areas almost with impunity. Some responsibility for these acts of terrorism clearly lies with the Palestinian leader Mr Arafat, who has never firmly distanced himself from terrorism, let alone effectively fought against it. The inadequate measures taken to combat terrorism have destroyed a great deal of trust. We Europeans should not let our influence be diminished still further by creating the impression that we are no longer capable of distinguishing between cause and effect. No conflict can be solved through terrorism and violence. Accordingly both sides must end this violent conflict. Israel must withdraw from the Palestinian areas. The acts of terror by the Palestinians must cease. We need to make demands of both sides. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen's statements on the Beneš decrees, which I expressly welcome, mark a noteworthy change in the Commission's attitude. Many initiatives, Commissioner, saw these issues as bilateral in nature and not to be put in the context of negotiations on European enlargement; I expressly welcome the way you have now abandoned this manifestly untenable position and I praise you for it. You obviously did this influenced by the public debate sparked by Mr Zeman, who, this House should note, has presumed to advise the Israelis to do with the Palestinians what the Czechs did with the Hungarians and Sudeten Germans after the last World War – which I consider to be the most monstrous 
thing he has said. Such an attitude of mind has, though, no place in the European Union, and so, Mr Verheugen, I expressly welcome the way you have put discussion of these decrees into the context of the European legal order, recognising the political and moral issues involved, which go against the EU's legal order, and which are indeed obsolete, being incapable of having any future legal effect within the EU, and that what matters now is to make it our concern, in a spirit of good neighbourliness, that they do not constitute obstacles on the road to enlargement. Questions therefore arise and demand to be answered. If the decrees have indeed lapsed, as the Czech government maintains, why were they not unambiguously annulled? If, though, they have not lapsed, and can still be employed in practice, indications of which are unfortunately numerous, how, then, can they be reconciled with the European legal order? And the pre-eminent fundamental question is that of what line the Czech government takes, not only on excesses but with the expulsion of entire ethnic groups as such, that is, on what we have unfortunately learned to call ethnic cleansing. That the Foreign Affairs Committee intends henceforth to set in motion investigations by experts is therefore to be welcomed to an extraordinary degree, as these issues affect not only the EU's conception of itself as a community based on law, but also the foundations on which the EU enterprise rests. These issues must be clarified before we can actually complete enlargement successfully. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even considered rather dispassionately, it is possible that the Laeken Summit will one day appear to be a waypoint at which the Europeans stopped stumbling along, found their feet again and set out to find a way out of the blind alley of Nice. If this proves to be the case — we are just at the beginning of this process — then this would certainly be associated with the Belgian Presidency and your name, Mr Verhofstadt, and I am quite happy to congratulate you on this now in advance, just in case! There are two reasons for this development, and it is useful to run over them once more. What caused this to happen? Certainly the strong, even damning, criticism of the outcome of Nice was a factor. The European Parliament played a vital role here; this House was the source of the vast majority of the criticism directed towards Nice, although we recognise and acknowledge the fact that the formal conditions for enlargement were agreed on there. My second point is that the events of 11 September and everything which happened in their wake have made it more than clear that Europe will only be taken seriously in the future if it acts as a community and that we need to get back on track and work towards developing as a community. These are the two reasons. Now we have the Convention which we wanted, and we are therefore also responsible for what emerges from it. We must not overlook this. The outcome of the Convention will only carry political weight if it is supported by as broad a consensus as possible. That is why we need to make our contribution in the Convention to producing a draft treaty which has broad support. Only then will it afterwards stand a chance of also uniting the Intergovernmental Conference. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the arbitrary arrest of a Member of the European Parliament and a number of his fellow campaigners in Vientiane has put a severe strain on relations between the European Union and Laos. In the intervening period both the institutions of the European Union and also the Member States concerned have done everything in their power to secure the release of those arrested. In this context I would like to thank both the Commission and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, under the leadership of Elmar Brok, and also all those colleagues who have become involved in this issue. Those arrested have now been released again. The Italian government was particularly helpful in that it sent a government representative to Vientiane. This action was ultimately successful. I would also specifically like to thank the Ambassador of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, who made himself available for discussions with us both here and in Brussels and who obviously also had a very positive influence on events. Laos has been a single-party state since 1975, that is to say that it is not a democracy as we understand it. Places where there is no democracy and no freedom of choice usually do not have any constitutional checks either, and Laos is no exception to this. Despite this, the European Union has a cooperation agreement with Laos, and in this framework the European Union is assisting not only the development of that country but is also helping to encourage democracy and constitutionality. The ASEAN delegation accepted only this year that this assistance was indeed useful. There are some very good projects in which the European Union is involved. I would like to make it clear at this point that regardless of the unacceptable behaviour of the powers that be in Laos, we stand by our cooperation agreement and our willingness to provide assistance. I also concede that our concept of democracy and constitutionality does not necessarily have to be accepted by every country on this planet. In fact we need to ask ourselves every now and again if the European Parliament is really in a position to wave its finger at every country in the world and lecture them about democracy and constitutionality. Nevertheless, we do have our principles and they have been infringed in this case. We also intend to make sure that they are respected in future. But we are willing to carry on helping Laos, whose people are amongst the poorest in the world, and to contribute to ensuring that this country has a chance of achieving a degree of prosperity. However, we also want democracy and constitutionality to occupy their rightful place in Laos. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above all the constitutional issues, the present situation sees Europeans being asked the question: What is your capacity to act? Is the European Union perceived as being able to act in the context of efforts to deal with this international crisis, or is it not? To ask the question is to answer it in the negative, because the ones taking action are the Americans and, alongside them, partly the British and their allies, but not the European Union as such. Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived. They too are only a small junior partner in the business and have nothing like the weight that Europeans could have if they acted together. Only as a community will Europeans acquire capacity to act – they will not do it bilaterally, trilaterally or multilaterally. So it was a gross error for the ruling Big Three to set off before Ghent. Far from demonstrating European capacity to act, that is a trip down a one-way street, showing considerable lack of awareness of how Europe works. Those who have acted in this way had better take good note of that. We need capacity to act as a Community. So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force. Without such an instrument, Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world. That is why it is ridiculous for us still to be arguing about how this instrument should be financed. In this respect, the Community must prove its strength. We also, however, need an instrument at home. We need the capacity to combat terrorism across national frontiers. Police work goes on in the Member States, but it must be clear to all that international terrorism can only be combated with any prospect of success by units that are in a position to operate without regard to national boundaries. Action as a Community is what Europe lacks, and it is on that that we must concentrate. (Applause)
Nassauer (PPE-DE
). 
 – (DE) 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we Europeans should be clear in our own minds that we are going to be weighed in the balance in the times that lie ahead. The United States of America and world public opinion will be looking to see whether we demonstrate our solidarity and our capacity to act in the face of the new challenges of international terrorism which have just become visible. European effectiveness has hitherto often fallen at the hurdle of national sovereignty. Effective joint action has often been blocked by invoking national sovereignty. Now, national sovereignty is not an objective in itself, and certainly not if it tends to hinder rather than promote the defence of national independence against terrorists and the effective protection of citizens against terrorist attacks. It is for that reason that the future will see us having to develop effective Community instruments and examining whether national sovereignty helps or hinders us in doing so. Solidarity with the United States is a principle invoked on every side, and this is right and proper, as this attack has been not only on the United States but also on our fundamental values, as was intended. That is why it is so perilous for a member of the Commission, namely Mr Nielson, to abandon Europeans' solidarity as a community. His remarks are dangerous because they blur responsibility for the terrorist action, transfer the guilt for it onto the victims, and pour scorn on the solidarity we affirm in the resolution on which we are voting. These remarks, then, must be withdrawn. We can expect Mr Nielson to apologise for them. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, taking as a starting point the reports by my esteemed fellow Members Mr Evans and Mr Pirker, I would like to talk about the communication from Commissioner Vitorino which is at the heart of this. He is a colleague whom we hold in extraordinarily high regard on the basis of our joint work in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and whose opinion I have very little in common with! A fundamental debate is taking place about asylum and immigration in Europe. It is about guidelines for asylum and immigration in Europe. We need to be clear about two things: first about the quotas to be applied and secondly about the content. As far as the methodology is concerned, European directives on asylum and immigration can only set minimum standards. It is only possible to oblige the European Union as a whole to accept minimum standards. Anything going beyond that will not be accepted. One example of this is that Commissioner Vitorino's proposals on family reunification may suit some people, but it is not possible to stipulate a binding solution for the entire Union. Some revision is needed here. As regards content, we need to limit and control immigration. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned the concept of ‘fortress Europe’. It is precisely because we do not want to erect a fortress Europe and could not do so anyway that we must control and limit immigration. The approach proposed by Commissioner Vitorino does not meet these requirements. A couple more examples: by adopting the concept of the safe third country, we in Germany have been able to reduce the number of asylum-seekers from some 450 000 to well under 100 000. Commissioner Vitorino has virtually given up this concept, by making its use dependent on conditions which make it almost impossible to apply in practice. My second point is that binding material grounds for granting asylum are laid down in the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It would be giving asylum-seekers an incentive if we go beyond the binding framework of the Geneva Convention, as in the case of persecution by non-State agents for example. There are some very worthy individual arguments in favour of this, but we cannot allow a higher level of asylum than at present. The problem of asylum is with the procedure. It is still a fact that 90% of all asylum-seekers in Europe are not victims of political persecution. So we need to get the procedure under control. If we can manage to bring the procedure to a rapid conclusion, we can be more generous when it comes to grounds for the granting of asylum. However, this does not sit well with the three-stage asylum procedure that Commissioner Vitorino is proposing, for example. Commissioner Vitorino, if Mr Schily, the German Minister for the Interior, who as you know does not belong to the same party as I do, behaves in the same way in Council as he does in Germany then your proposals have no hope at all! (Applause)
Nassauer (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity in speech must now give way to solidarity in action. In Germany, the Christian Democratic parties – the CDU and CSU – feel, in any case, that we have obligations towards the Americans in our joint resistance to terrorism, too. American action was decisive in the reconstruction of our country and the recovery of our unity. So we must share with them the burden of combating terrorism. Mr Vitorino's proposals are a first step on this road, and the right one. They are not, however, short-term measures. They will become effective in 2002 at the earliest. Right and proper as they are, we can and must do more. We can, for example, make Europol better equipped than it is at present. Europol urgently needs an agreement with the USA, within the framework of laws currently in force, on the exchange of data in the fight against terrorism. Such arrangements have previously foundered on our making our data protection provisions into the measure of all things. Our protection of data has therefore been of more use to the terrorists than it has to their victims. We must make it possible for Europol to become immediately operational. We must at once put in place whatever joint action teams are available. Wherever terrorists are being investigated, Europol must be on the spot and promoting the immediate exchange of data between the investigators and those working in Europol headquarters. These opportunities already exist, and we must seize them. It can be done within the framework of the laws in force and does not require us to wait for the incorporation of directives into national law.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have announced an ambitious programme, Mr President-in-Office, and the ambition of your proposals is commensurate with the challenges which lie ahead. That is why, at the end of this debate, I should like to express the wish that you will be equal to your own ambition and that you will enjoy success. On behalf of the CDU/CSU Group in this Parliament, may you be an effective President-in-Office of the Council. You will need our support and you will also have it. You rightly said at the beginning that you want to reconcile the public with Europe. This has been expressed in various different ways. The reasons for the loss of confidence in Europe, which before was hidden beneath the surface but which, since the referendum in Ireland, is now there for all to see, are many and diverse; they have been mentioned. In passing, however, it should be stated that a further factor in this was the way in which the powerful members of the Council for example dealt with a country like Austria. Perhaps your foreign minister will have the opportunity to repair some of the damage which has been done to Austria’s faith in Europe. The method adopted hitherto in intergovernmental conferences has had its day because decisions of consequence – such as those made when treaties are amended – must no longer be made in Council back rooms in the dead of night; instead beforehand we need a phase of public consultation. That is why we are calling for an assembly, similar to a convention, to be set up which will organise a public dialogue in Europe before decisions are made in the Council. To achieve this we need, above all, your support. Mr President-in-Office, it would be a first and very specific step forward – and would also send out a signal to the Irish – if the intergovernmental conference were to be opened up and made more transparent. In taking a step of this kind, we would also be justified in going before the Irish for a second time and tabling the treaty for a vote. This is what you will be judged on, and we wish you every success for your work in the interests of Europe. (Applause)

Mr President, if you would permit me to make one final comment: all this confusion would have been quite unnecessary if the parliamentary administration – after producing the record and noting that contrary to the result given, only 272 votes against were printed out – had detected the error before this record was published. Surely that is not an unreasonable expectation? (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate draws to a close allow me to point out that there are considerable expectations of the way in which the European Union acts in this important part of the world. It is not the case that we are free to decide with no adverse consequences whether to become involved there or whether to opt out; no, the countries in this part of Asia have very particular and well-founded expectations that the Europeans will become engaged in their part of the world. These expectations exist because there the power of the United States of America in terms of both the economy and security is an established fact and because China is next door and is gaining increasing influence. In this power play, the expectations of many states in South-East Asia are focused on the Europeans considering establishing what the Asians call a strategic partnership, obviously with the aim of producing greater stability and creating a balance between the major powers there in the interests of the Asian states. These have had their first experiences of rapid economic growth which was then slowed by the crisis, and now they see that they have an opportunity to leave this crisis behind. At the same time they realise how essential it is for them to find their way out of the crisis in partnership with others, and not least with the European Union. That is why, as I have said, it is not simply a question of our own interests, how and on what conditions we get involved there; instead we are in a situation where expectations are pinned on us. That is why we are not free either to say, no we will do that or we will leave that; we are obliged to become involved in this part of the world. This opens up huge possibilities. If we behave there, not as colonialists as we did in the past, but as partners who are prepared to contribute their own experiences alongside those of another continent, we will be listened to. Under no circumstances must we Europeans let this opportunity pass us by!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, behind the incredibly complicated title of the draft directive lies a relatively straightforward problem. What we are dealing with here is the issue of sharing the burden of receiving refugees from civil wars. It is as if the awkwardness of the title in itself makes it clear just how uncomfortable the underlying issue is for Europeans. The way in which Europeans have so far handled the issue of burden sharing can only be described as a complete tragedy. The problem is one that we have been familiar with for many years. We know from painful experience what happens when civil wars break out in an area such as the former Yugoslavia, and people flee in their tens and hundreds of thousands – and, of course, they go wherever they can be sure of being safe from persecution and war. In the past, this has meant especially Austria, but also Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. In the Bosnian war, for example, my country received more than twice as many refugees as all other countries put together. This is the reason why those concerned have been pressing for a solution to this problem for years. But so far this has not been enough to make the Council produce anything more than declarations of solidarity with those receiving refugees. May I remind you of the very unfortunate attempts of Commissioner Vitorino’s predecessor, Mrs Gradin. Those interested might care to take a look at these. This is why I am grateful to you, Mr Vitorino for taking up these problems energetically after Tampere. I would like to add that, unlike the previous agenda item, this is not an initiative by a Member State but an initiative of the Commission and the Commissioner responsible. To that extent, you are also responsible for it. Much as I welcome what you have done in principle, I also have some objections concerning particular details. The issue of burden sharing is tied to one single problem. Will it or will it not be made a rule that all Member States must receive refugees? If, Mr Vitorino, you adhere to the principle known as two-sided voluntary action, meaning that refugees should be able to decide for themselves which Member State they wish to enter, and that Member States should only take in refugees voluntarily, then everything will remain exactly as it is and absolutely nothing will change. The burden of receiving refugees simply cannot be offset by financial contributions. The first thing that has to happen is that Member States should not to be able to back out by making a financial contribution; instead it should be obligatory for all Member States actually to take in refugees according to a certain system. This system would, of course, take into account the absorptive capacity of each country and all other conceivable viewpoints; it would also, of course, ensure that families are not torn apart and also, of course, on a quota basis, take into account the wishes of the refugees themselves. But it must be laid down in writing that every Member State has a duty to make a personal contribution in terms of receiving refugees. This is the first weak point in your draft. Thankfully, this has been corrected by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and I hope that Parliament will go along with the opinion of the Home Affairs Committee. The second point, Mr Vitorino, relates to family reunification. The indeterminate concept of the family that you use cannot be imposed upon all the Member States. Those wishing to permit the entry and residence of all eligible relatives in addition to the core family may do so. Member States cannot, however, be forced to do this; it must be included on an optional basis. This is our second serious objection. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning Commissioner Vitorino complained that he had to comment on an initiative that was by no means of his own making. He is going to be faced with the same problem again, because we are now talking about a French initiative. It is concerned with mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals and it is another case demonstrating that there are good reasons for reserving the power of initiative solely to the Commission. It is evident that the Commission is in a better position than the individual Member States to promote the Community interest, whereas individual Member States tend to concentrate on their own interests. So this is another piece of evidence that suggests we should press for the Commission to have a monopoly on legislative initiatives. This initiative dates back to the end of the French Presidency, at a time when the Presidency's achievements were threatening to look very slim indeed. So they rapidly came up with a whole string of initiatives just before the final whistle, in order to improve things somewhat, and they were all pretty rushed. I would recommend those of you who take an interest in legal matters to compare the first and second drafts. The first draft is all good will and politics, whereas the lawyers have crawled over the second draft and turned the whole thing into something that could reasonably be called a legislative initiative. In other words, there is a very considerable difference in the legislative quality of the first and second drafts of the initiative. Furthermore, the legal objective of the initiative is now quite clear. It quite simply means that an expulsion decision made, say, in Paris, would be binding throughout the Community. That makes sense – after all it would be complete nonsense if a decision made in Paris could be appealed against in Helsinki or in Berlin or in any other Member State within the area of freedom, security and justice. But the Community needs a legal basis for such action. A legal objective is no replacement for a legal basis. That is a lesson we have just learnt from the European Court of Justice's ruling on the tobacco advertising directive. In that case too there was a legal objective which very much deserved to be debated, but the ECJ made it clear that there has to be a legal basis in the European treaties. The Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs twice unanimously rejected the French initiative on the grounds that there was no such legal basis. The French Government based its initiative on Article 63 of the EC Treaty, where you will find a legal basis for a European expulsion law. That is not quite the same thing as mutual recognition of decisions at national level concerning expulsions. A Community expulsion law would be a directive in which the Community lays down a proper legislative procedure stipulating the circumstances in which an illegal immigrant can be expelled and possibly even deported. However, in this case we are talking about all the Member States mutually recognising expulsion decisions and other similar decisions reached in accordance with their respective national legal frameworks. That is quite a different kettle of fish. As we have been rather more careful recently about whether the European Union and in particular the Community aspect of it can do everything it would like to do, we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs were firmly of the opinion that while we support the legal objective pursued by the initiative, we can see no legal basis for it. We therefore propose that this initiative be rejected. At the same time we have immediately presented a suggestion for solving this problem. It is perfectly clear that this difficult situation could be resolved if there were a European expulsion law. So the inevitable consequence of this process is that we call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a directive creating a European, a Community expulsion law, which is also binding within the Community. That would solve all the problems associated with this initiative. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a spirit is abroad in Europe. It is the spirit of intergovernmentalism. It is creeping intergovernmentalism – encouraged by the Council – which led Europe into the Nice impasse and on this, President Prodi, we are the Commission's natural allies. The Commission and Parliament must work together closely on this issue. If, President Prodi, Parliament occasionally criticises the Commission's administrative behaviour, it is not meant in a spirit of enmity towards the Commission, but as an expression of our democratic duty of scrutiny. In cases of doubt it brings us closer together rather than rending us asunder. The issue of national parliaments has been addressed. I am very keen on having a convention rather than a forum to prepare the next stage, because the negotiators at a convention, such as the Council representatives, the Commission, parliament and the European Parliament, have democratic credentials. We should not espouse the arbitrariness of so-called socially relevant groups. This understanding should also be clearly formulated at the Commission. For the rest, we must consider the role of the national parliaments in the European process. At the end of the day, it is the national parliaments which control the Council. That is their job. They have no authority over Community institutions, such as the Commission or even Parliament. So when we talk about involving national parliaments, we need to put them on the Council's side in the legislative process. They cannot restrict the role of the European Parliament. It is extremely important to us that this be clarified. One of the focal points of the Commission's work will be asylum and immigration. We do not want to elaborate a European asylum and immigration code, we want – as Mr Vitorino rightly said – individual directives. But we need a common concept. It is this which is still lacking and which the Commission has yet to formulate. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Asia is one of the regions of the world where the European Union's potential in terms of political influence has not been fulfilled. This is not intended as a reproach, it is simply a statement of fact. This becomes apparent if you go to that part of the world as an EU representative, when you will find, for example, that no one is satisfied with a statement that you are representing the European Union – you will always be asked which Member State you come from. It is a way of judging how important you are. And where the European Union has not achieved its full potential it is also possible that it has not assumed its full responsibility either. That is why the ASEM process is so enormously important. I think I can say that the Commission largely has Parliament's support in promoting this process. The Commission can, to a very large extent, count on Parliament's support for its overall approach and for the agenda it has drawn up. So one of the most important things today is to make the European public aware of the ASEM process. However, our partners in Asia do not understand that, in practice, we are very inward-looking. The issues that most concern us are the Intergovernmental Conference, enlargement and, when the occasion arises, problems on our political doorstep, such as the Middle East. But they do not understand the fact that we are not fulfilling our potential when it comes to all those issues that are important for global welfare and peace. People's expectations of the European Union are enormous. They envisage a strategic European presence in Asia, yet we are certainly not in a position to provide that in the foreseeable future. It is obvious what lies behind this: an awareness of the constant presence of the United States of America and of the growing importance of China. They would like to see Europe providing a counterbalance. We must seize this opportunity and in fact this is a chance for us to win support for our principles there. This is something else that can be achieved through the ASEM process.

Mr President, contrary to popular belief and notwithstanding the debate that has taken place here this morning, this directive is not about defining the concept of family, which is generally binding throughout the European Union. It has far more to do with establishing in precise terms, which third-country family members should be entitled to join relations who are immigrants to the European Union. No one would dispute the fact that families have the right to live together. But what really matters here is where we draw the line as regards family members. For example, I have a wife and two children, and they have children too. I also have siblings and aunts and uncles. If I were to count the number of relatives I live in close contact with, that makes 25 all told. Commissioner Vitorino, if I were to apply for asylum in Portugal, for example, then clearly I would be unable to assert a claim to live there with 25 relatives. In other words, we must be sensible and draw the line somewhere. That is the crucial problem we face with this directive. We must also distinguish between those whose stay in the European Union subject to a time limit, and those who reside here permanently. I should point out that this draft directive extends family reunification provisions beyond those that have been in force in the Member States to date. This sends out another signal to would-be immigrants, which will, of course, have major consequences. This directive would have very different implications for States with a high proportion of immigrants, such as Austria, Germany and the Benelux States, than it would for States such as Portugal, Finland and others, which do not see very much in the way of immigration. We cannot endorse this directive as matters stand, because it would lead to a dramatic increase in family reunification, which is one of the main grounds for reunification. Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect for your work, I cherish the hope that the Council will decline to give it the unanimous assent it requires. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council presidency has given itself a bit of a pat on the back by declaring that the Portuguese Presidency has done what it set out to do, no more and no less than that. That may be true, Prime Minister Guterres, for the routine tasks. The image people have of the Portuguese Presidency will not, however, be determined by whether or not routine tasks have been completed, but by two events: firstly, by the fact that as President-in-Office of the Council you have had a hand in imposing the sanctions on Austria, and secondly, by the complete lack of progress in the Intergovernmental Conference. Why does this matter? Posterity's opinion of us as a generation of European politicians will not be determined by the successes which you listed; it will be determined by whether we succeed in carrying out the historical duty of our time in the Union, which is enlargement towards the east, the reunification of Europe after a century of European civil wars. To make this possible we need to reform ourselves in the Intergovernmental Conference, and no progress has been made here at all so far. This must be noted. There is no doubt that this is a difficult business. The candidate countries themselves are having to make their contribution; we must of course be ready for enlargement and we cannot make enlargement conditional on the success of the Intergovernmental Conference. After all, it would be disastrous if our lack of ability to reform became a yardstick by which enlargement was judged. That is why we need to put more effort into making progress here. The fact that, for example, the French President has made a proposal to draft a European constitution enshrining the division of responsibilities is a major step forward, because dividing up responsibilities would create the confidence necessary for more majority voting in the Council, which is one of the most important preconditions for its ability to act. The example of Austria is harmful because you are painting a picture of a European Union which interferes in the internal affairs of a country. This is not the kind of European Union which the people of Europe want; neither is it what the candidate countries want. It is regrettable that this has happened under your presidency.

Madam President, even to a slightly unprejudiced eye, there is clearly no trace of racism down the broad middle of this House. Even if we disagree on a report on racism, the reasons lie not in racism in Parliament but in the report itself. For example, the report not only contains laudable words on the fight against racism; it also deals with matters such as the voting rights of third country nationals in specific countries or the right to hold public office, which may be decided one way or the other, but which have nothing whatsoever to do with racism. And it is precisely on these points that this report is a dishonest and sorry effort and I make no bones about the fact. The fight against racism, to which we are all committed, is turned into small political currency and abused, which is why we are unable to vote for the report in its present form. I stand firmly against the way in which racism has been played down, as we have said, to make it a subject of political debate. That is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report. We are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make. There should be a broad consensus on this in this House. But we cannot possibly allow this concept to be taken up by one side of the House and used to conduct a political fight; we must insist that matters of this sort are dealt with in a way which can meet with everyone’s approval, and that is not the case here.

Mr President, we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe. That means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls. A common immigration law means that we have no more internal borders and take responsibility for the people entering the European Union at the external borders. It is perfectly clear that there is abuse, for example in connection with asylum claims. The number of people applying for asylum on grounds which have nothing to do with political persecution far outweighs the number of applicants recognised as victims of political persecution. Abuse in this connection means not only that asylum is sought on non-existent grounds but also that the same applicants make applications on these grounds to several countries. We will only be able to control this abuse if we at long last implement the EURODAC fingerprinting system, which we have been waiting such a long time for, and if the Council finally decides to allow this system to enter into force. It has already proven its efficacy on several counts, and it is essential if asylum is to gain acceptance. We therefore advise the Council in the strongest terms to make its decisions so that EURODAC, the system which allows fingerprinting throughout Europe, can become a fact of life. That is the task now before the Council.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The President of the Commission has proclaimed this to be the decisive year and I would urge you, Mr President, to use this as an opportunity to put the relationship between the Commission and the Member States on a new footing. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. Hitherto, this meant that in fulfilling this role, the Commission placed special emphasis on the rights of the Community, and rightly so. But the unwritten rights of the Member States are there in the background of the Treaties and I believe it is high time that the Commission came to see itself more as the guardian of the rights of the Member States in the course of its work. I would urge you, Mr President of the Commission, to also become the advocate for the rights of the Member States, for what frustrates us on occasions about the way the Commission works, is its attempt, under the pressure of getting things done, to lay claim to certain rights. We must bear in mind that in future, more must be done to uphold the rights of the Member States. This is pre-requisite to Europe’s gaining acceptance.   One example of this is the Federal Republic of Germany’s being composed of federal states, with the Länder
 having original rights. They must also be recognised by the Commission. It is difficult to imagine us amending the Treaty without the consent of Germany’s Länder, for example. Therefore, Mr President, please cast yourself in the role of advocate for the rights of the Member States. Accordingly, we demand a catalogue of competences that clearly distinguishes between the rights of the Community and those that reside with the Member States. The Commission would gain a great deal of support amongst the citizens of Europe if it was to follow this course, and we urge it to do so in the strongest terms.

 Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics. Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself? Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here? Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days? From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider. Who would want this to happen? Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics? Europe is a community of law. Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold. One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did. It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty. (Applause)
 It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!

Mr President, it is with great regret that the CDU/CSU group acknowledges the decision to grant Turkey candidate status. We consider this Council decision to be a fatal error because it will permanently encumber rather than foster relations with this important and reliable ally. Even the Council knows that the criteria for integration have not been met and will not be met in the foreseeable future because Turkey is not even prepared to amend fundamental clauses in its constitution, such as the influence of the military. The expectations raised in Helsinki are therefore bound to end in disappointment. This is why we want relations with this important partner to be based on a partnership within as close an economic framework as possible, i.e. by meeting the obligations of customs union, rather than on illusionary prospects of membership. Relations with Turkey are too important to be founded on the hypocritical act of Helsinki! (Applause)

Mr President, the key question is whether or not the arms embargo decided by the Council in September of this year as part of the restrictive measures against Indonesia should be extended beyond January next year. I think, having weighed up the pros and cons, that the right decision is to maintain the embargo. This allows us to send out two different signals. First, we want to bolster the development of democracy in Indonesia. It has, without doubt, maintained momentum with the democratic change of power in Indonesia and we want to and we must encourage the democratic forces in Indonesia. We must also recognise that the role of the army continues to be highly problematic, to put it mildly. There have been atrocities not only in East Timor, which is now to gain independence, but also in Aceh and other parts of Indonesia. What we have to do is make it clear to the army that it is now being closely watched by the public worldwide, especially in the EU, and that we take the liberty of drawing our conclusions from the behaviour of the military. At the moment, these conclusions must be that we are not prepared to supply this military with any more weapons, irrespective of whether or not the fear that they will now obtain these weapons from China is justified. We, in all events, should not render ourselves guilty of this arms supply. I therefore advocate, after careful consideration, that we vote to maintain this embargo, because it is a signal to the army in Indonesia and we hope that it is also a signal to the democratic forces in Indonesia which, we may assume, will be encouraged by our stance.

 Mr President, the matter of the Annex to the Rules of Procedure will most certainly be determined by a simple majority. But the addition of an Annex to the Rules of Procedure is quite clearly an amendment to the actual Rules of Procedure and, as such, requires an absolute majority. We can never amend the actual Rules of Procedure by means of an Annex. That is perfectly clear. We have just decided, may I remind you, that the common regulation contained in the interinstitutional agreement, with the necessary measures to facilitate the trouble-free conduct of OLAF inquiries in accordance with the Parliament resolution, which is appended as an Annex to the Rules of Procedure, is applicable within Parliament. This resolution did not achieve the necessary majority. It cannot therefore claim validity on the basis of the Rules of Procedure. I believe we would be well advised to refer this matter back to the competent committee for consultation now and discontinue the debate on the Rules of Procedure here. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, responsibility for Europe and the European Union again having by the end of tomorrow a Commission which is capable of acting lies with this Parliament, with ourselves. In an overall judgement, we have to decide whether or not, tomorrow, we can affirm our confidence in this Commission. In so doing, Parliament accepts responsibility for the Commission, as well as for individual proposals, and that does not make our decision any the easier. I should like first of all to say to you, Professor Prodi, that as President of the Commission you can count upon the broad assent of the CDU/CSU Members of Parliament. The fact that we have formed different judgements about individual members of the collegiate body is no surprise. A number of people have used the opportunity of the hearings brilliantly, for example Chris Patten and also Mr Vitorino. However, you have on board a candidate who has been implicated in a matter regarding a donation in his home country and about whom we must, since yesterday, ask whether he has made an appropriate statement in the hearings before this Parliament. This particular candidate could become a burden on the Commission. I allow myself to issue this warning because the restoration of trust which you yourself, Professor Prodi, have quite rightly demanded naturally depends too upon your heading a Commission which can go to work unimpeded by reproaches of this kind. It is precisely this which must distinguish it from its predecessor.  There has been talk of the political balance of the Commission. It is not a condition of any treaty that there should be balance of this kind but a sign of political wisdom and, in fact, of consideration for this Parliament. Our critical comment on this subject still stands, although we do not want to emphasise it again right now. We therefore have high expectations, Professor Prodi, in connection with our comprehensive affirmation of yourself and of your task as President of the Commission. You are the first Commission President to whom the Treaty grants the ability to reach agreements, and not only with the Commission as a whole but also with each individual candidate. We can only encourage you to make energetic use of this role. No government of any Member State should, in future, be able to disregard the President of the Commission. In this connection, we demand that the budget and the supervision of the budget be very clearly separated. We shall judge the Commission on the basis of whether you succeed, when legislating, in being more true to the spirit of subsidiarity than Commissions in the past have been. A new culture of subsidiarity must enter the Commission over which you preside.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has, of course, been overshadowed by the war in Kosovo, but that is all the more reason for keeping in mind that the Presidency of the Council, for which the German Federal Government was answerable, was only able to maintain its position in this matter because it had the unqualified support of the Parties of the Union, whilst your own supporters, Mr Fischer, would have taken pleasure in knocking your trainers from under you, had you still been wearing them of course. The Council Presidency"s track record is questionable, and it is in fact only the Council Presidency itself which disputes this. Let us have a look at the outcome of Agenda 2000 for example. This is not a decent compromise, but a shaky foundation. It will not even withstand the onslaught of the first WTO negotiations. This holds true for the problems associated with agriculture as well, which are far from being resolved, and which have not provided any scope for enlargement whatsoever. All that was achieved was a worsening of the situation in terms of farmers" income. The promising attempt at a solution in the form of co-financing was allowed to slip out of sight at the very beginning, which was an amateurish way to proceed. At first, the German Chancellor stirred up the question of net contributions and the overhaul of the financial framework, particularly in the German public arena, and then, when it came to solving these problems, he failed miserably. Institutional progress? Wrong! Everything has been postponed for the future and for future conferences. The single currency, Minister Fischer, which you have rightly claimed to be one of Europe"s great achievements, obviously wasn"t even important enough in the eyes of the Finance Minister, who had responsibility for this matter at the time, for him to attend the first important session. That is also something which should not be forgotten. And where exactly did the gossip concerning the independence of the European Central Bank come from, which was to contribute not least towards the weakening of the euro against foreign currencies, and to the fact that only now, much to our relief, is it beginning to pick up again. This Council Presidency"s track record is problematic due, in particular, to the fact that like few before it, it failed to act in a way which was beneficial to the Community. A particular instance of this can be seen in the case of the withdrawn Regulation on end-of-life cars. This was not dealt with in a way which was beneficial to the Community, and it was left to Mr Trittin to play the role of the fanatic, a role which obviously comes very naturally to him. No, this Presidency of the Council has forfeited the trust built up by many previous Chancellors over the years, and therefore it is particularly appropriate that we should examine the events of the last six months with a critical eye. We cannot talk in terms of success. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur on the subject of feedingstuffs and hygiene, I closely followed the debate in two committees, not only in the lead committee – the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but also in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is advising it, and I would like to tell the House that, as rapporteur on feed hygiene, I basically welcome the Commission’s efforts to further improve food safety in the EU across the board. From farm to table, the criteria for the production of our food should be very clearly defined. Quite apart from the harm to food, the food scandals over recent years – BSE, dioxin or nitrophene, for example – cost the European taxpayer a very great deal of money in terms of products recalled. That is why I very much welcome the fact that – as Commissioner Byrne has said – the cost of recalls will not, under the Regulation as submitted, be borne by the European Budget as a whole, but, and far more stringently, by the feed business operator, that it is to say the tax payers do not have to pay but the wrongdoers themselves. That, I believe, is a reason why the regulation has to very precisely define what a ‘feed business operator’ is. I do not think there is any contention about the need for the requirement to take out insurance not to be imposed on farmers who produce cereals or other primary feedingstuffs. The recipients in the feed manufacturing industry are already able to analyse and categorise the barley, rye, maize, and so on with which they are supplied. On the basis of what I am constantly being told, I believe that the smallest growers of feedingstuffs, whether this be for supply to others or to feed their own farm animals, should be exempted from this Regulation, which would, however, come into effect if additives were to be mixed in, be it by the farmer himself, by the feed manufacturer, or by a mobile mill that comes to farms for that purpose. It cannot be acceptable for rules to be made, for the purpose of precautionary insurance cover, some of which it is in fact impossible to comply with. I still believe that what we demand politically should not ignore the realities of life, and that applies in particular to threshold values for undesirable substances when compounded, or transferred, and so on, which are increasingly based on what is analytically feasible. Let me reiterate that you have lost touch with the protection of health if you go about finding a lump of sugar in Lake Constance. To an increasing extent, threshold values are being determined by reference to what modern analysis can do rather than to the potential risk, and we should concentrate on the actual danger posed to the consumers. Insurance companies have made it clear to a hearing with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that, in the absence of any clear definition of what is meant by ‘risk’, the costs involved in financial guarantees would become quite incalculable, and they would find it very difficult to estimate them. My appeal to the producers is that they should start with voluntary insurance. That is why, Commissioner, I, as rapporteur, have called in Article 8 for a feasibility study on binding and non-binding guarantees, and if we get one in 12 months’ time, then I am sure we will be able to look further ahead. This feasibility study should not only examine the national regulations currently in force, and the systems and practices relating to liability in the feed sector and similar areas at the national level, but should also set out recommendations for such a feasible and practicable guarantee system at EU level. So let me say once again, that we should demand politically only those things that are practically feasible. Let me take this opportunity to extend warm thanks to all the Members of this House who have joined us in doing serious and constructive work on this topic, particularly, too, the representatives of the Commission, with whom we had really good discussions, and the Irish Presidency of the Council for its good cooperation and especially for its very realistic assessment of what is and is not feasible. I am on tenterhooks to see what happens next, and whether we will indeed be able to come to an agreement following first reading.

Mr President, Commissioner, I too, of course, would like to express my solidarity with the countries of the South, but I hope you will not mind if I, instead of repeating everything my fellow-Members have said, concentrate on the drought in my own country. Those of us who cast our minds back somewhat further, Commissioner, know that very dry summers have been a frequent occurrence, and so I am not one of those who regard this summer of the century as a quite unique phenomenon, but, farms being as financially stretched as they are, we can hardly dismiss this summer of the century as nothing more than an occupational hazard. Like the harvest report that has been presented, the Ministry’s official figures also confirm that the drought has brought on extreme losses to the harvest in Germany, but also in its European neighbours, and you have already pointed out that the European Commission has taken initial steps to enable the direct payments that are in any case due to farmers to be made more speedily and at an earlier date. Although I see that as an encouragement, this does not add up to extra money. It strengthens farms’ liquidity, enabling them to buy in feedingstuffs and sow new crops. Let me ask you, though, something that has been briefly discussed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that is, whether there are indeed no uncontracted funds available in the EU’s agricultural budget. I would have thought that resources were available. Is it not conceivable that this is an area where help could be given more speedily – with co-financing at national level, which is what some of the German federal states are considering? Let me say by way of conclusion something that has already been mentioned very often – that the eventual consequence for forestry, including in our country, will be that many farmers’ own financial resources will be insufficient to permit reforestation. If we are to talk in terms of rural development, this is where we should be giving really serious thought to how we deal with this problem.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is – I believe – an important topic that we have on the agenda this morning: the prohibition of antibiotics in animal nutrition. Before we come to what I hope will be the conclusion to this matter, I would like to thank everyone most warmly: my fellow Members, the staff of the political groups and also the secretariat, all of whom have done such hard work on this. Parliament has been calling for many years for antibiotics to be banned as growth-promoting additives in animal feed, and today we are going to make it a reality in Europe. In our debate on the second reading of this proposal for a regulation, it is certainly apparent that there are widely divergent views on the value of additives in animal feed. The use of antibiotics as growth-promoting additives in the fattening of livestock will now be banned in the EU once and for all with effect from 31 December 2005. I see this policy decision as long overdue in view of the growing resistance to various antibiotics used in the medical treatment of patients. Feedingstuffs imported into the EU from third states must of course take account of the requirements of this new regulation in the same way as those produced within Europe. One important topic in the preparatory debate was the open declaration of flavourings in feedingstuffs. Our constant watchword was ‘let it have in what it says on the tin’, but I do take the view that we must not go too far. The open declaration of flavourings in feedingstuffs has now been dealt with in a compromise between the Council, the Commission, and Parliament. At present, over three hundred flavourings are permitted, and these have been subject to the strictest controls and supervision in the course of production. It is for this reason that all the final formulations of flavourings in feedingstuffs no longer have to be declared individually. I think – and this is an important point – that, in the sphere of business competition, we should also, in the European Union, be aware of the fact that there is such a thing as corporate know-how, and protecting this corporate know-how, should be a matter of major concern to all of us in the political sphere. That is why the new rule in the proposal is an exact parallel to existing rules applicable to food for human beings. We must not apply more stringent rules to animals than we do where people are concerned. That, Commissioner Byrne, is why I see Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which deal with this subject, as particularly important, and I would be glad if you would briefly state what view you take of them. The main point of the compromise is, however, the use of histomonostats and coccidiostats, which are antibiotic additives that will continue to be urgently needed in poultry farming. We are not talking here about the use of antibiotics to promote growth; these products are used to protect animals, and their use as a means of preventing disease in animals strikes me as a vitally important topic, as these are agents that we cannot, at present, do without. I speak from personal experience, having, myself, some years ago, been deeply involved in the field of turkey-rearing. It is generally regarded as inevitable that the disease known as ‘blackhead’, which occurs very frequently in poultry farming – and, I might add, in organic farming as well – will wipe out up to 60% of livestock if we are no longer permitted to use these products. So, whilst these agents will not be permitted as additives indefinitely, they will still be permitted for a limited period. Our intention, Commissioner, in this time-limit in Amendment No 16, is to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the pharmaceutical industry to get them to produce suitable alternative products or, instead, to develop new vaccines. Today’s vote will see us making a definite advance in the protection of consumers in the European Union, and I very much hope that, at 11 a.m., every side of this House will be able to come together to vote accordingly.

Mr President, Commissioner, there have been many speeches this afternoon about the financing of EU agricultural policy. In my opinion, the overall situation over recent years has been much more favourable for consumers than for farmers. I never tire of saying that the proportion of outgoings spent on food by the citizens of the European Union has fallen continuously over recent decades. There are hard figures indicating that those who, decades ago, spent 40% of income on food, now spend approximately 14%, so foodstuffs are not surplus junk and, with EU support, the farmers produce them and look after the countryside perhaps even far more cheaply than municipal farms could do it. My idea of the European agriculture model has remained unchanged for years. I would like farmers in the European Union to continue to perform the dual task of producing high quality products and caring for and maintaining the cultural landscape. In my opinion, therefore, we should really now be using the debate on common agricultural policy to ensure that this task can be performed in the long term in difficult locations not only in Germany but in all European regions. There has been much discussion today about your proposals, Commissioner, but, if I have understood you correctly, there are one or two places where you have allowed for a certain readiness to compromise, and this affects decoupling. The agriculturalists in my parliamentary party are demanding clear differentiation between arable and animal production. I therefore regard as eminently important the consistent continued development of common agricultural policy and also quantity-oriented market policy for milk. Commissioner, I am convinced that we should now decide – as you have always said. The parliamentary reports are available and I am very keen to know what the Council will make of them. We should really use this negotiation capital. Finally, I would therefore like to encourage you to follow our suggestions. If we all fight together it will produce the best results for agriculture and I am someone who would really like to defend you out there. (Applause)
 I cannot imagine what interest you could have in initiating something unsuitable. (Applause)

 I approve the accession of the Czech Republic because I take the view that the reunification of Europe and thus also the return of the Czechs to the European family must not be halted by the irresponsibility of those Czech politicians who have still not yet grasped how a modern state functions under the rule of law. It is to be hoped that the lasting injustice of certain of the Beneš decrees continuing in existence will be able to be done away with more speedily within the EU than if we refuse to admit the Czech Republic to it.

 Mr President, not only am I Right-wing in orientation, but I also sit on the right. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, my fellow Member Mrs Auroi, for this report. I welcome the Commission's proposal to simplify matters by drawing together and streamlining ten directives on the Community comparative tests. For twenty-five years, comparative tests on arable crops have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions. The scope of these tests has further increased substantially in recent years. This system of follow-up controls is seen as a very important instrument to harmonise the marketing conditions in the Member States and is therefore also endorsed in the internal market. These comparative tests must not, however, be restricted to those seed and plant varieties that have so far been certified and listed in the Union's common catalogue. There must also, in my view, be a quite specific way of dealing with seed designated for use in organic farming. With this Directive, however, we should not only be looking at organic agriculture. I believe we should also be taking a look at conventional farming, and so I personally wish to support Mr Sturdy's amendments. A clear threshold for GMO traces in seed must be laid down in accordance with the latest scientific knowledge and research, not ideological criteria. If the traces lie below this threshold, it should still be permissible to place the seed on the market. The presence of genetically modified organisms in seed, at least in the lower batches, is generally adventitious and often technically unavoidable. What is required here is genuinely feasible detectability in order to draw conclusions as to whether the seed should be placed on the market. With this Directive, we must therefore create a clear legal framework for agriculture as a whole – both for organic and conventional farming – and for food producers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, am sincerely grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo. The way that this new proposal Forest Focus
 combines two old demands, that woodland be protected against environmental pollution and against fires, meets with my fundamental approval. Just so that you realise that I know what I am talking about, Commissioner, I will say that I have a background in forestry, but in a northern country. I want to strongly emphasise the point of principle that forestry policy must remain in the hands of the Member States, and to keep on reminding the Commission of the principle of subsidiarity. Will Forest Focus
 have a beneficial effect on woodland and on those who own it, or is this just another exercise in keeping new hordes of bureaucrats employed and fed? I have to tell you that, representing as I do the German province of North Rhine-Westphalia, I get the impression that Brussels takes absolutely no notice of what is really going on in European forestry. Within the European Union, 65% of the woodland is owned and managed by 12 million forest owners, and this branch of agriculture causes them serious problems as far as profitability is concerned. Two years ago, we ran a conference on this subject in Brussels. In my homeland, Commissioner, young farmers no longer have any interest in woodlands or in forestry. The property rights of woodland farmers are constantly being eroded. Why should a forester give his all without getting financial compensation, often without his efforts even being recognised by society? If we say yes to it, Forest Focus
 will have to cover the social, economic and ecological fields in Europe. Bio-diversity and monitoring have a nice sound to them, but they do not give woodland farmers any financial entitlements in respect of the work they do. Let me say in conclusion that it is not those who are constantly discussing woodlands who are engaged in caring for nature and protecting it. I can tell you that if we do not succeed in making forestry a more profitable proposition overall for agriculture, young people in my homeland will simply throw in the towel. Even now, they are no longer prepared to clear up storm damage, for they take the line that this is a luxury they cannot afford. Let us not start imposing more and more new demands on them. Let us help to clean up the air. Let us help provide compensatory measures as well, so that they can do such things as fertilising the soil with manure and lime. Things really have to be said on the basis of practical experience, instead of just the empty forms of words that really do try my patience this late in the evening. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, we can only welcome the campaigns to fight hunger in the developing countries. The official statements, all of which have been quoted in today’s resolution, must now be followed up with further, and very definite, measures. There is no doubt a great variety of ways out of the poverty trap in the less developed countries. As a member of the European Parliament’s ACP delegation, the removal of barriers to trade with the poorest countries concerns me greatly. The number of people in the developing countries who have less than one dollar a day to live on continues to grow. Across the world, 900 people die of hunger every hour, many of them children. Deep public concern has long since ceased to be enough. The European Union and other donors must respond more vigorously to hunger in the developing countries, increase food and humanitarian aid and distribute the money provided, from the HIV/AIDS fund, for example, more quickly. Road tolls, import and customs procedures, and so on, in the areas at risk, mean that logistical capacity is not sufficient to ensure that food aid is delivered on time and without a hitch. We here in the European Parliament should, by means of today’s resolution, make clear once again that the worldwide costs of failure to abolish hunger are enormously high. Wars, repeated disasters, international crime, drug dealing, economic stagnation, illegal immigration and premature death, ladies and gentlemen, are but a few among them. Of course, the decision to admit all products – with the exception of arms – from the least developed countries to the European Union market is a step in the right direction. Mr President, I have almost finished. Of course we must improve market access for agricultural products from the developing countries. But we should also point out that other highly developed countries in this world really must make greater efforts too. As a member of the ACP delegation I support the work of this resolution as a whole.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the message from this morning's debate was that ‘prevention is better than cure’. No to prophylactic vaccination; yes to ring-vaccination. The recurrent refrain was that, in future, all-round improvements to systems will be required as a matter of necessity. In terms of the number of animals culled, the course taken by foot and mouth disease in the European Union in 2001 made it, no doubt, the most serious outbreak ever. The Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease worked hard, and very efficiently, over the course of several months, and those involved were complimented and thanked this morning. It is important that any future changes in policy should take as their starting point an analysis of how the disease has been handled up to now. European producers and consumers attach equal importance to the transposition of Community legislation, Community finance and, in particular, to the drafting of proposals for the prevention and control of diseases in agriculture. What I will now say, I say as one who comes from the region bordering on the Netherlands, with a very high number of granivores. We must, yet again, draw attention to the need for better networking when cooperating on an acute case of the disease. Political requirements are important, Commissioner, but real work on the ground, on farms, done by veterinary surgeons and the inspection authorities, using the necessary crisis plans and an emergency room, is an absolute necessity if decisions are to be taken quickly and efficiently. Perhaps I may conclude by giving the example of my constituency, where many institutions have caused a great stir among farmers by participating in a large-scale test of how they would manage a foot and mouth crisis. You have to think of it as a practice exercise for firefighters, a call-out without a fire. What was called for was the most rapid reaction in case X, and this cross-border cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany achieved a really most impressive result. Let us all hope that this exercise never has to be done for real. We are backing the Commission's proposals. We look forward with eager anticipation, hoping that we will, in future, have a policy on epidemics that will gain greater acceptance among farmers and consumers than has been the case in the past.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I think this is a very wide ranging and difficult subject. I have listened very carefully to what you have said and I come now to a topic that I would have liked to have put before you earlier in writing. But I believe that a joint effort may perhaps still elicit an answer from you. Nitrofurans is a generic term. One very important product it covers is Nifursol. Nifursol is the last histomonostat still to be permitted in the EU for use as an additive in poultry feed to prevent blackhead disease. I admit I am not a scientist. According to my information, however, experts say that this product was banned for good in Regulation 2377/90. The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) was asked by the Commission to make a risk assessment of Nifursol. Investigations that will give a definite answer have yet to be carried out. Because I also have the feed additives report, I have now heard the alarm bells ringing, because many who are concerned with this matter fear there will be a treatment crisis in a few months’ time. As a logical consequence of the ban on nitrofurans in Regulation 2377/90, Regulation 1756/2002 was issued on 23 September 2002, banning Nifursol from 31 March 2003. When this ban comes into force on 31 March, there will, for example, be a crisis in the treatments used to combat blackhead disease in turkeys. No alternative remedy is available legally in the EU, either as a feed additive or as a veterinary medicine. The consequences of the ban will hit both fatteners and consumers. The consequences are a treatment emergency, a painful end for large stocks of birds, jeopardy for turkey farms, the development of an uncontrollable black market, and an increase in imports of poultry from third countries, where many substances that are banned in the EU are used with few or any controls. Only last week antibiotics of the nitrofuran group that are banned in the EU were found again in cheap imports of meat from third countries. Logically, mixed feed manufacturers will now have to stop using Nifursol by January 2003 at the latest if there is to be no more such feed in the silos by the beginning of March. My question to you this evening, although I do not know whether you can answer it, is: what solutions do we now have available? Personally I find it hard to understand how the Commission can on the one hand, in the report in my possession, on the Commission’s draft of which we worked very hard – approve the use of histomonostats,–– while on the other hand, in another regulation, banning the only product in existence on this market. I therefore have a few questions. What are we to say to the fatteners? What are they to do? What forms of treatment are available to them? And secondly, is the Commission aware that European production is continuing to decline, is disappearing from the market in the European Union and that we are being increasingly exposed to third country imports of turkey meat, although we still do not know what quality standards those imports come up to?

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the Commission for this generally very positive proposal on additives for use in animal nutrition, which I welcome in principle. I would also like to thank the Danish Presidency and my colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. This proposal aims to consolidate existing rules on additives in feedingstuffs and clarifies certain procedural aspects related to dossier evaluation and the types of authorisation granted to feed additives, thus making them more transparent for producers and consumers alike. An aspect of fundamental political significance in this proposal is the ban from 2006 on the four antibiotic growth promoters that are still authorised. This is not an arbitrary ban, but is based on reports by the Scientific Food Committee, and is consistent with the demands repeatedly voiced publicly by medical experts. As cross-resistance to drugs used in human medicine can also no longer be ruled out, there is a need for action in order to protect consumers. In this regard, pressure must be brought to bear by granting temporary authorisation only so that other methods, such as appropriate vaccines, are developed. In principle, I am in favour of the Commission's proposal. I too think it is inappropriate, on the antibiotic issue, to give what amounts to a blank cheque for unrestricted use of coccidiostats in the future. It is not plausible to ban antibiotics on health policy grounds if these health policy arguments then do not apply to the use of coccidiostats. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the committee responsible, wants coccidiostats and histomonostats to continue to be authorised for use until 2008. The Commission should then submit a report, before 1 January 2008, on the use of these substances, together with a proposal on further use. Where, then, are the points of difference? First of all, Amendment No 2 regulates imports from third countries of additives for use in animal nutrition, and states that the rules governing imports must at least be as strict, in terms of application and monitoring, as those which the same Member States apply in order to safeguard human and animal health. 
In Amendments Nos 4, 7 and 9, I speak out very clearly in favour of guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives. I call on the Commission, in cooperation with the European Food Safety Authority, to establish and submit guidelines for the authorisation of feed additives. In its vote, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development clearly endorsed the adoption of guidelines in the interests of simplifying the authorisation of additives. Once an additive has been authorised, it is surely sufficient for the relevant dossier to be regularly updated, rather than being subject to a full review every time. Parliament is calling for mixtures and premixtures containing flavouring and appetite stimulants to be exempt from the labelling requirement. It is stated explicitly that this will not apply to flavouring and appetite stimulants subject to a quantitative limitation when used in feed and drinking water. There are of course now calls in this House for the use of coccidiostats to be permitted only when prescribed by veterinary surgeons. I myself take the view – and I speak from experience – that we must have preventive healthcare for animals as well. Some form of animal protection is required, and it is obvious that an animal which is already sick needs to be treated with far higher doses, so my own practical experience makes it difficult for me to understand the reasoning behind these calls. As regards the ban from 2006 on the four antibiotic growth promoters, I would like to say to Commissioner Byrne that my Amendment No 31 offers a sensible compromise here. Finally, I would like to reiterate my sincere thanks to everyone who worked so hard on this issue.

Commissioner, I have a further question. I believe that your response to the problem of third-country imports was simply that you are introducing more stringent controls on imports of feedingstuffs. However, Mrs Doyle and, indeed, Mr Parish were referring to the end product. After all, throughout Europe, we have ready-made foods from these countries in our freezers. This is why we are asking to what extent we have to impose controls, reject the products, or even tolerate distortions of competition with the European Community.

 Mr President, President-in-Office, I would first like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Joseph Daul. Like many of the previous speakers, I fundamentally welcome the fact that the European agricultural model is to be extended to a multifunctional agricultural sector in the enlarged European Union. This requires qualified external protection, and within the EU we still need markets to be regulated. However, although I fundamentally view the Franco-German unity that has emerged in the run-up to enlargement as a good thing, it does raise some issues for me. Although taxpayers and farmers already know how much money is to be spent up to 2013, they do not know on what. Germany's position as a net contributor will worsen simply because Germany's Federal Chancellor has locked us into the agreed financial framework for the agricultural policy from 2006 to 2013, with 25 countries. As we have heard again and again, and as the Commissioner has also told us, the reduction in compensation payments needed after 2006 will mean that less money will go to the agricultural sector than does now, and that applies particularly to Germany. I simply want to make that criticism clear. Incidentally, our Chancellor is not renowned for being the German farmers' friend! The Commissioner for agriculture has put the net contribution to be made by the EU's farmers to financing enlargement at EUR 500 million in 2013. This amounts to the difference between the additional costs resulting from direct payments for the new Member States and the increase in agricultural expenditure approved by the EU Summit. This Commission calculation indicates to me that Europe's farmers will have to pay the lion's share of the burden of enlargement. The Commissioner for agriculture has repeatedly presented it as something positive that the Brussels Summit did not cap resources for rural development – that is to say, for the second pillar – but he can also tell us … (The President cut off the speaker)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank my colleague, Mr Khanbhai, very much for his own-initiative report. As a member of Parliament's ACP delegation, I have been concerned with this issue for years. Sustainable agricultural policy, land reform and rural development are important political challenges with a view to the developing countries being entirely independent. Why, with our considerable financial aid, have we not been able to make a more decisive contribution to improving the situation in the poorest countries? I constantly ask myself what Europe is doing wrong. What are the rich countries doing wrong, but also what do the poor countries gain by stepping up their own efforts? I think that we will have to get much tougher on these issues because we can see – and have examples to prove it – that the world population is not prepared to put up with this injustice any longer. As European politicians working on agriculture, we know only too well that the European Community's common agricultural policy regularly comes in for harsh criticism for the impact that it has on agriculture in the poorest countries and this has again been the case this evening in a number of contributions to the debate. It is true, however, that the critics often think that the answer is too easy, because it is wrong to think that a greater opening up of trade will inevitably lead to better development of the food sector in the developing countries. Many have said it: the EU is already the largest importer of food in the world and against this background the agricultural problems in the vast majority of developing countries will not be resolved solely by more intensive trade and agricultural deregulation. It is actually wrong – and here too I am addressing Mrs Kinnock – to call for total liberalisation and an abandonment of national quotas in developing countries. This would lead to merciless distortions of competition, which small farmers would have absolutely no chance of withstanding. In conclusion, allow me to mention three facts: we need production for domestic consumption and for export on the basis of a reformed system of land tenure; we need better employment; we need sustainable management and we should consider new ways forward.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just start with warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen. I am committed to retaining the use of food waste as feed under appropriately strict conditions. Let me make it clear that we are talking here about dishes officially permitted for human consumption. Let those listening to me understand that, to take a couple of examples, this is about unsaleable bread that will no longer be fresh the following day, about left-over pieces of cake and that sort of thing. The prevention of disease is adequately taken care of by the heating of food waste in the manner prescribed, which furthermore facilitates proper recycling of such remnants and thereby acts as a deterrent against even more ‘rubbish tourism’. Moreover, it provides pigs with a first-rate supply of essential amino and fatty acids, and makes it possible to reduce the importation of feedingstuffs. It is a fact that liquid feed, that is, swill, derived from food waste, is known to have relatively few negative effects on rearing pigs. There is a need to guarantee an appropriate standard of sterilisation in order to kill off pathogens. The outcome of the conciliation procedure, with the seven amendments, was indeed accepted by the Council without further ado, and, on the extremely important Amendment No 25, which embodies a comprehensive compromise, I welcome the Council's draft providing for transitional measures under stringently monitored conditions for at most four years from 1 November 2002 onwards. Any firm undertaking by the Commission to develop a directive on biowaste including kitchen and food waste, by the end of 2004, must primarily aim to stipulate safe use, recovery and reuse. Contamination has to be monitored, and we welcome this approach. It is the firms that have invested a great deal of money in these measures in order to meet the very highest standards, and are officially monitored, that are the best guarantee of food waste for feed being harmlessly removed and processed under controlled conditions. As has already been pointed out by those who spoke before me, we could give a whole catalogue of examples to demonstrate that no adequate guarantee can be provided by a general ban on feeding this sort of stuff to animals. What becomes of it then? The future should find us still not destroying this valuable feed. Let me say in conclusion that, on this issue, I am myself a strong advocate of a regulation rather than a directive, because I can already see how these things will be transposed differently in different countries, because I have an inkling that competition will be distorted, and because, if something is wrong, then it is wrong everywhere, be it in Germany, in Austria, or in any other Member State in this internal market.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that you cannot control safety – you have to create it. Listening to today's debate on food safety, I fear that we have not come very far in recent years. Producers and consumers have the same objective, we are all in the same boat, so it is not just consumers that are affected but the producers themselves as well. As I see it, consumers are quite right to be alarmed by the serious problems we have had recently, the string of scandals that have already been mentioned – BSE, dioxin, Nitrofen – it is a very long list. Ultimately, however, the weakest link in the chain is always the farmer, the producer, who has taken a battering because of the price situation. That is why the agricultural sector has a particularly great interest in achieving high quality in the upstream market. I am at present rapporteur on the issue of additives in animal feed. Commissioner, I am certainly in agreement with you in calling for very stringent measures to be applied to a wide variety of additives. We are talking here about antibiotics and cocciodiostatic drugs. I have just been discussing this with some of your colleagues. As a practical person, I firmly believe that we got things adequately sorted out on paper a long time ago but, in practice, when it comes to implementation and control, I regret to say that we will still have a lot of black sheep to deal with in future. We will only make progress here if the control system involves tougher sanctions. As I see it, those who are too slack deserve to be pilloried and  should have their quota withdrawn and their production units shut down. Only if you point the way on this with our support can pressure be exerted to restore a reasonable situation in the European Union, one in which producers and consumers can process or consume food in the knowledge that it is safe and we can maintain the high quality of food that we have in the future as well. I would like to fully support Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposals, but we have spent over 20 years talking about people's willingness to spend more money on food; it is just that the distribution process has totally changed. We need to be honest about the fact that many people simply cannot afford it. They want it all. They want not just to eat and drink, they also want to go on holiday, to travel, and so on and so forth. That is why we have food that is virtually free.

 Mrs Van Lancker's report on sexual and reproductive health and rights has been firmly rejected in Parliament by the Christian Democratic Group, and I can only support this position. We must not ignore the concerns of the national catholic lay movements and organisations in the candidate countries. The subject of this report does not lie within the competence of EU policy-making. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, decisions about such matters have to be made at national level. I am extremely concerned, above all about the endorsement given to the call for so-called emergency contraception – the 'morning-after pill' – to be standard practice. This is tantamount to proposing the legalisation of abortion in the Member States and candidate countries. Given the particular sensitivity of this subject, the adoption of the report will provoke a negative response in the candidate countries towards the enlargement process and put it under unnecessary strain. The report makes substantial demands of their governments, demands that have not been included in the decision-making programme in any shape or form. In any case, I am firmly convinced that this kind of behaviour is not the right way to foster confidence in the EU's democratic decision-making process.

Madam President, Commissioners, the reports by Mr Trakatellis and Mrs Scheele belong together and a great deal has already been said about that in today's debate. Most people in Europe are against the use of modern biotechnology outside the laboratory, but there are varying shades of opinion. Surveys have shown that most people feel they have too little information to make a clear judgment. Around 86% of those surveyed in the European Union said that they would like to know more before eating genetically modified food. Researchers concluded from their results that there is a market for genetically modified food in Europe, provided it offers clear advantages. However, consumer freedom of choice is paramount. Consumers want to be able to decide freely between GM products and conventional products. We have debated the new labelling directives most intensively today. As far as I can see, we should only label products where we have proof and can control labelling requirements. If the presence of genetically engineered changes in the product itself cannot be proven, as in the case of meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on genetically modified feed, then I think there should be no labelling requirement. And another very important point for me: I do not like the idea of incalculable liability risks for companies, which is why practicable limit values are essential. I would therefore advocate a single limit value of 1%. The Commission points out in its working paper that zero tolerance is impossible in practice; several of my fellow Members have repeatedly addressed the imponderables of nature and I have nothing new to add to what they have already said.

 Mrs Ayuso, the rapporteur, has drafted a text that is much closer to the proposal for a compromise between the Council and the Commission on ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. Treating this matter as an urgent subject of major importance in Strasbourg now opens up the possibility of our vote being followed by an agreement at last. Only thus can we give our farmers and traditional small-scale distilleries the security that they so urgently need in order to be able to plan ahead. There is no sense in discriminating against the producers of agricultural alcohol while leaving synthetic alcohol unaffected. It is for that reason that we referred this matter back to the Agriculture Committee weeks ago. The changed language in the new Commission proposal at last allows the Member States to enact their own supplementary regulations at national level. Only this will make it possible for small distilleries in the EU to survive. The cultivation of potatoes and cereals for the purpose of extracting alcohol and the utilisation of fruit from flourishing fruit meadows ensures the continued existence of these valued cultural landscapes, which, without national supplementary regulations, will be in extreme danger.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion there is still a great need for information about eastward enlargement in the EU Member States. At least, that is what I find when meeting citizens at events in my constituency. Today I would like to speak in particular about the challenge of agriculture and eastward enlargement. I would like to congratulate Mr Olsson on his very good report on EU enlargement and agriculture. How can the new Member States be successfully integrated into the common agricultural policy? That is a key question for most of the candidate countries and it is crucial because in the countries of central and eastern Europe agriculture accounts for a larger proportion of national income than the EU average. The same is true of employment in the economy as a whole. The accession of ten countries in 2004 will increase the agricultural area by 29% and the number of agricultural holdings by 74%. But the number of consumers will increase by 24%. How can we best shape accession and integration in the long term? In my opinion, the countries of central and eastern Europe will and must press ahead with changing the structure of their agriculture. The European agricultural model where farmers have the twin tasks of producing in some places and caring for the countryside in others must be applied in those countries too. In my view, the high standards of hygiene in production and processing must apply from the first day of accession, otherwise European consumer policy will become a farce. Environmental concerns and alternative jobs in rural areas must be funded from the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. We agree that the Commission is taking the right approach there in aligning financial compensation payments gradually. If we allowed too much money in at the start, agricultural structures there would be ossified, and that cannot be the right way for those concerned either. While I believe our citizens do not know enough about eastern Europe, I also noted during the hearing that farmers in the candidate countries, too, still have a lot of public relations work to do at home. (Applause)

Mr President, that remains the case. I understand why Members from other countries are displeased. Let me say as a German that I think what has happened in Germany is a scandal, and our farmers are the ones who are suffering from it. Mrs Künast, our Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, has done nothing except make announcements at the top of her voice. Functioning channels of communication need to be created, and very soon. This has not been achieved. At the time of the Lannoye report, our group wanted mandatory reporting by the authorities to start at an earlier date. We asked for 2003, and 2005 was what we got. What I want to ask the Commissioner is this: what do you think about that in the aftermath of this scandal? Should we not, after all, impose this obligation on the authorities earlier?

I welcome the differentiated approach taken by the Commission in order to guarantee a high level of health protection using specific hygiene rules for food. That these rules also apply to wild game on sale to consumers in large quantities is only logical. Nonetheless, we really must make a distinction between commercial marketing and the private consumption of game bagged in small quantities. Hunters who give away or sell small quantities of game directly to the local retail trade after the hunt cannot and should not have to meet the same requirements as large meat-processing factories. We need specific rules for hunters which reflect common practice. However right and welcome these new rules are, private hunters must be exempted from them. Our hunters already know a great deal about game hygiene and diseases. Trained hunters already take full responsibility for the healthy state of the game which they provide and will continue to do so in future. The European Parliament Committee on the Environment has accepted several proposed amendments which allow flexibility in the marketing of game and game meat without jeopardising food safety and I urgently call on the whole House to support these amendments.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Ayuso most warmly for the work she has done. The Common Market Organisation for agricultural alcohol was voted down in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We are convinced that the Commission should withdraw this proposal and revise it. Whilst the Spanish Presidency would very much like to wrap this issue up during its term of office, I do not think this will be possible, quite simply because Parliament will not have produced a position for the Agriculture Council in due time. There are three key issues; firstly, for example, the title of the act. Is a Common Market Organisation appropriate, or a simple regulation? Secondly, to what extent do we include synthetic alcohol? Thirdly, is there the need for a regulation on state aid? As discussions currently stand between Parliament and the Commission, these issues have not been resolved. If the Commission were to abandon its dogmatic position on the Common Market Organisation, it could surely agree to the regulation providing for the purely statistical supervision of synthetic alcohol. This way ahead would be possible even without extending the legal basis. I reckon that a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers could adopt the lightweight Regulation that was originally called for. I continue to be highly sceptical about the aid provisions, on which many questions remain unanswered. On the issue of universal land use management across the whole of Europe, which includes the sparse areas, and also on the twofold task of agriculture, which is both the cultivation and raising of agricultural products and the care and maintenance of the cultivated landscape, we must support producers of agricultural alcohol through the production of corn, potatoes and fruit. My appeal to the Commission is this: please, let us not needlessly wreck a system that works.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, feeding catering waste to livestock instead of indulging in waste tourism – that is my political demand. When shall we create an authoritative and objective system of public information in the EU? In Germany, catering waste is fed to fattening pigs under the strictest of rules. Confidence in the processing facilities is high. My country is the most populous in the EU; about a quarter of the entire population of the Union lives in Germany, and there is a correspondingly high output of catering waste. There is no evidence of any epizootic disease having occurred in our country through the feeding of treated catering waste to livestock. What are we actually doing to ourselves with this planned ban? In my view, we have started to place pigs before people as far as food intake is concerned. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already raised this point, and I too find it monstrous to do this in a world where people are starving every day, where slum children have to rummage about in rubbish heaps for food scraps. What life of luxury is Europe trying to lead? This, you may well say, is an emotional argument, but it is extremely important to me, Commissioner, that we restore some rationality to our examination of the feeding of catering waste. It must surely be possible for us, through our own efforts and with the aid of the media, to present these issues in a rather more objective manner. The treatment of catering waste must, of course, comply with appropriately high sterilisation standards. That is the only way to guarantee the destruction of foot and mouth and swine-fever pathogens. Plants supervised by the public authorities are surely the best safeguard. Along with the numerous previous contributors to this debate, may I say thank you very much to Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done, but I also hope that we can reach a practicable solution and that we can send out long-term signals from which the feed industry, waste processors and farmers can take their lead.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is, I believe, beyond dispute that public health and food safety are matters of importance to all of us, producers every bit as much as consumers. Preventative consumer protection is on everybody's lips, but my understanding of these things leads me to believe that our role as politicians is not to give additional impetus to the emotional discussions that are still being carried on about the ongoing handling of the BSE crisis. For my part, I do not want to help discussion of matters concerning BSE to slavishly follow the spirit of the age. In view of current events in Germany, I favour the strictest controls right along the food production chain. We also, of course, need the toughest sanctions when offences are committed. In the meantime, I advocate testing for BSE from 24 months. Now, when can we actually expect science to come up with definite findings on how individual animals get the disease? I think that when that does come to light, we could say goodbye in no time to the idea of killing off all our livestock. Until then, going down the road of mass slaughter is only one alternative. The feeding of omnivores with meat and bone meal will no doubt continue to be prohibited, at that for a variety of reasons. We will certainly maintain the current ban on feeding with animal meals for as long as the open declaration of feedingstuffs is not made mandatory and for as long as the processing of offal from healthy animals cannot be carried out with any guarantee of safety. I will mention, though, the formulation used in Mr Olsson's report. He, too, says ‘for the foreseeable future’. ‘For the foreseeable future’ means, for me, that the future may perhaps find us back on a better road ahead. Let me conclude by saying that it is easy for us to explain to any critically-minded consumer that healthy meat on healthy bone is part of good diet. Processed healthy bone in animal meal is, though, apparently a danger to the omnivore. Just try making sense of that. We could take numerous other examples to illustrate this state of affairs. I take the view that we, bearing as we do political responsibility, have to get back to discussing things in a more matter-of-fact way.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by expressing my thanks to Mr Maat. I think he has approached this subject in a very realistic way, many years of discussions on animal transport mean that, in my view, an emotional approach is no more use to us. Nobody, when talking about animal transport, means the kitten in the hand luggage on an aircraft, and nobody mentions the little dog on a lead on the Intercity train and certainly not the racehorse in its specialised horsebox on the motorway. No, in the Maat report we are discussing the well-being of animals on their way to be slaughtered. Now, I have been in this House for a very long time, and so it is to the Commissioner that I am speaking when I say this: On paper, or so it seems to me, we have produced variations on this theme for years, and we have been constantly demanding more. All the same, we are still repeatedly shocked by the often intolerable situations revealed in individual cases by the checks, which are far too few and far between. Better transport conditions are wanted not only, indeed, by campaigners against cruelty to animals, but also by producers and consumers. In reports and amendments, we demand expert staff, purpose-built vehicles with adequate space for the animals to lie down in, ventilation, supplies of food and water and, for animals for slaughter, journey times limited to a maximum of eight hours. The proposal to end the payment of export refunds for live animals is one which I find quite crucial and also particularly deserving of support. There are objections to this, amounting in the final analysis to this being an interference with the market. Even Jewish ritual slaughter is brought into the argument. I could smile a little at that, for even that is now possible in the EU. It would be better to transport the meat afterwards. Commissioner, I find that a person's weak spot is very often his or her wallet or purse. More inspection, more controls, high penalties and loss of the licence where offences are found to have been committed, these would bring about more effective improvements for us all.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The number of cases of foot-and-mouth is on the rise once again. As you know, the foot-and-mouth virus is harmless to man but is highly infectious to all cloven-hoofed animals and results in huge financial losses. With new outbreaks occurring, I again call on the Commission and the Council to favour vaccination rather than slaughter. We must rethink how we fight zoonoses in Europe and today we have what I think is a very balanced resolution in order to do so. Consistent preventive hygiene is only one side of the coin. With people travelling the world for business and pleasure, foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat and we must be far more consistent in applying controls at airports to prevent this epidemic from coming in and spreading. I realise that both farmers and consumers are having difficulties with the ethical implications of the current vaccination policy. We are talking fatal consequences here. We must, at long last, move away from our non-vaccination policy. We need marker vaccines. We need a reasonable approach to ring vaccination and we need to make up our minds once and for all to show through our policy that science needs to make progress with prevention, that is, by formulating suitable vaccines.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has presented a proposal on minimum standards for the protection of pigs in order to improve the welfare of these animals. I think it is a real pity that animal protection directives are being issued rather than regulations. I say this as an enthusiastic supporter of regulations because, when directives are implemented, they generally bring new distortions of competition in their wake in my country. I do not intend to address all the individual compromise amendments proposed here because a great deal of what we have set out here is, in my view, glaringly self-evident. To cite just one example: training for qualifications is recommended, but young farmers in Germany gave up trying to survive in this fiercely competitive sector without qualifications a long time ago. I think it is a great pity that the Commissioner does not have much time to listen but I shall address the controversial interests of consumer organisations once again, given that they are wheeled out in every debate and everyone keeps saying that consumers are calling for better protection for animals. Just by chance, I received Commissioner Fischler's press communiqué yesterday in which he said during an interview with a German broadsheet that consumer habits have now reversed post BSE. According to Commissioner Fischler, people are increasingly turning to cheap supplies once more. My many years' experience confirms precisely that. People obviously have to watch their budget and we need to be sensitive here and not overstep the mark. Everything we do has a very decisive impact on costs. Many of our proposed amendments refer to slot widths. We almost make out that we are experts here. I think others are far better placed to judge. Mr President, I think that you know everything there is to know about pig production in Bavaria. You know what it means when we talk about docking tails, castration, teeth clipping and all these important things. I should like to close by saying that we need to strike a balance between animal protection, health and environmental aspects. We also need acceptable transition times for the whole business.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only today is the food inspectorate the focus of public attention; it will have to endure public scrutiny again in the near future when it starts to pursue the ambitious aim that has been set for it. We cannot expect it, however, to eradicate criminal practices, slackness and black sheep; that goes beyond its remit. I have sometimes had the impression in the course of the present discussion that the wheel is being reinvented in the realm of food safety. Not so; let me counter that view by putting it to you that no previous generation in our Member States has ever been able to choose from such a rich variety of good and safe foods. Inspections cannot turn unsafe food into safe food. Safe food must be produced. That is why I am in favour of unequivocal and stringent measures. From producer to consumer, from byre to buyer, from pitchfork to table fork, if you like – every link in the food-production chain, be it the initial input by the farmers, the processing of farm produce by the food industry or retail food sales and the preparation and serving of food in restaurants and canteens, etc., should be subject to far stricter control. The traceability of foodstuffs must be guaranteed throughout the entire production chain. This morning we are discussing the subject of the food inspectorate, and perhaps we shall be doing so again in the future. We are wondering whether it should be an agency or an authority, where its headquarters should be, where the line should be drawn between its sphere of responsibility and that of the national authorities or how the two can interact. Last but not least, we are discussing the powers of this new authority. My constituents will be hoping that this is not just another paper tiger. Let us hope that the rich cultural diversity which is reflected in our European menus will manage to survive intact in conformity with the safety and hygiene rules. I truly wish success to this new institution; may it ensure that we are not caught empty-handed again in the not too distant future when the next scandal comes along.

Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the issue of animal welfare is mentioned, no one in Europe thinks of cats in cages at the airport, no one thinks of horses being transported to the Olympic Games on the other side of the world, and no one thinks of birds in cages on fifth-floor window sills. Over the years, it has been the transport of livestock in Europe and overseas which has understandably upset the public most of all. The consumers and the animal rights activists do not understand why there is still a need for it. In my view, the question is not so much 'why' but – quite rightly – 'how'. How are the animals transported? This has been discussed for many years at European level, so it is not a new issue. Commissioner Byrne, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 12 years, and we have been discussing this issue throughout these 12 years. We have already produced vast quantities of papers and resolutions. Why, then, are we making such slow progress? Animal welfare is now given far greater priority, and the focus is no longer solely on costs and competition. In contrast to earlier debates about animal welfare, the agenda increasingly includes ethical issues as well as technical aspects. To use a metaphor: we are all broadly in agreement about the destination of our journey, but the path is very rocky. I say this: through their shopping behaviour, consumers could have made a very significant contribution to setting a new course in the past as well. Prices were a key factor then, and I would argue that the final prices paid by consumers will be a key factor in future too. In its report, the Commission emphasises its plans to improve the implementation of existing legislation. I greatly welcome this statement. The licensing of transport companies, transport plans and the Member States' inspection reports must all be coordinated far more effectively, and I completely agree that Community standards should now be introduced for third countries as well. The definitions of the animals' fitness for transport, but also vehicle standards, densities, travelling times and rest periods, etc. must all be brought into line with current scientific knowledge to a far greater extent. I am in favour of animal welfare, and let me assure you that farmers are too. They have been for decades – in their animal husbandry, breeding and transport. Mr Byrne, thank you very much for stating this so clearly today. Let me conclude by saying that what I am opposed to are the different definitions of the animals' wellbeing. Given the great many directives in force, this diverges widely in the Member States. Happy hens in Germany will have to feel different from perky pigs in Holland or contented calves in Denmark. We cannot have that. It leads to distortions of competition, and I really must oppose it, also in the interests of farmers.

Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the subjects of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease have disappeared somewhat from the headlines, and with good reason. Thank goodness for that! In my view, their absence from the front pages will do more than anything else to restore consumer confidence. Commissioner Fischler, I should like to appeal to you to accept the amendments in the Sturdy report, because referring the report back to committee after the vote would only cause delays, as far as I can see. I could not explain such delays to the farmers, consumers and voters back home. What are we actually asking for? The first thing is that the goalposts should not be shifted in the middle of the game. The rules were laid down in Berlin. We are calling for the reintroduction of a limit of 90 head of cattle. I believe this is something upon which all of us, from our widely diverse regions, really must continue to insist at the present juncture. As for the plan to reduce the stocking density to 1.8 livestock units per hectare from 1 January 2002, I must tell you in all honesty that I am also at a loss to explain this to the farmers in my region. Another lesson we must learn relates to the repeated references to alternative production methods. I believe that organic farms are a good thing, but they are no panacea, because we are already seeing that there is too little purchasing power and too few markets for their produce. It is my opinion that the amendments could be accepted as they stand – time forbids me to repeat the wording of each one – from my point of view and perhaps from your perspective too. And last but not least, our guiding principle throughout this sector should be the need to produce safe food. Safety cannot be regulated with premiums. Safe products are the key to the restoration of a stable beef and veal market.

Mr President, Commissioner, in 1991, I joined with other colleagues in this House to vote against the abolition of vaccination at that time. I believe that against the background of enlargement, we will be forced to rethink the situation. Last week, 4000 animals were culled as a preventive measure in my region, after piglets had arrived there from quarantine areas in Holland. Since 2 p.m. today, foot-and-mouth disease may also have reached Germany and my home region of Münsterland near the Dutch border. If the cases are confirmed, Commissioner, the disease will have broken out in a region which is widely regarded as the "meat belt" of North Rhine-Westphalia. The EU's "no vaccination" policy has always been justified in terms of exports to third countries. So my question is this, Mr Byrne: is it not clear that this policy really has failed? What does Europe gain, in financial terms, from these exports, and what is the epidemic costing Europe? The Commission should put these figures on the table for the Council. I called for this two weeks ago in the Committee on Agriculture. Put the figures on the table, and do it quickly. Then the Council can decide, and the Council can take responsibility for its policies. The European Parliament will undoubtedly set out its views on this issue in its resolution tomorrow. I am in favour of emergency ‘ring’ and suppressive vaccinations, and I say: let us do it right away. I believe that the current situation is putting untold emotional and psychological strain on farmers. What about Europe's moral responsibility for its policies? Please, Commissioner, answer the questions we have asked. Please do not just read your prepared text because otherwise this whole discussion will be a waste of time. Thank you. (Applause)

) Mr President, Commissioner, research and society face great scientific and ethical challenges in the 21st century. Genetic engineering applications will play a key role. I would like to thank Mr Purvis sincerely. In the last legislative term I drew attention to the importance of genetic engineering in my report on genetic engineering and its impact on agriculture. We must now at last give the green light to green genetic engineering. To stick with this theme of colours, consumers have long since given the green light to red genetic engineering, i.e. the application of genetic engineering in medicine. The advantages are tangible and easy to understand. In green genetic engineering, its application in agriculture, consumers are, as I say, sadly still showing the red light. We must also show the red card to extremists. Biotechnology and gene technology must cease to be the poor relation. The EU must get on board the moving train of research and application or it will leave without us. I am worried by the trend of more and more small and medium-sized enterprises pulling out of green biotechnology and gene technology. The present EU moratorium means that while research is taking place the subsequent application of the product is not being allowed in individual countries. Undertakings, and with them jobs, are leaving Europe. In my view, the lights are on amber here. They must be allowed to change to green. Of course, whether we are talking about red or green genetic engineering, the ethical bounds to biotechnology and gene technology must be clearly formulated. I would like to say to the opponents of research that we have a moral obligation to use the opportunities this new technology offers for medicine and for caring for the world population as a whole. The public will give the green light to biotechnology and gene technology only if they have information and transparency with clearly marked out ethical bounds. I also appeal to industry to do their part in helping us with the public relations work so that acceptance will increase.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by joining in the gratitude expressed to Mr Parish. I think this is a very constructive own-initiative report. There is a rather nice saying that the future belongs to the young, but we can turn this around when we talk of European farming and say that, without young farmers, there is no future. The future of the countryside, and especially the future of young farmers in Europe, does not look good. The numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing. The number of farms in the EU has fallen constantly over recent years. Of course, we welcome the structural change but, at the same time, the extent of the change does give us cause for concern. The biggest decrease has been in the number of farmers under the age of 35. Thank God that young people from farms have the same career prospects as their peer groups and siblings. The tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing. The question of what becomes of the older generation left on the farm is often still unanswered. Unfortunately, farms standing empty have become a familiar sight – even in my country, which I would never have imagined possible. How many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers? Young farmers want fair prices for their products. It is not because of the subsidies that they choose to be farmers. The Parish report may help to improve the overall image of young farmers. The public pays scant attention to the services of farming. I should like to take this opportunity to thank you, Commissioner Fischler, for repeatedly highlighting the multi-functional task which farming fulfils. But apparently bad news makes better news. At the moment, you can read about the current BSE crisis blow by blow. But no one bothers to mention, for example, that consumer associations in my country have been wantonly campaigning for food at rock bottom prices for years now. Of course I disapprove of the criminal machinations of the feedingstuffs industry, the lack of controls by the authorities and so forth, but it is all this together which has resulted in the chaos in which more and more members of the profession find themselves. If you belong to this profession, if you are a farmer, then you will easily understand why young people ask, do I really need this? With the current BSE situation, it is quite out of order to pillory our farmers and young farmers. We have set standards. So-called ‘good professional practice’ has been continually developed by our excellently trained young farmers. Essential services in the production of foodstuffs and raw materials, the development, further development and preservation of the countryside and the protection of the natural bases for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future. I should like to close by saying that these young farmers do not just need reliable policies; they also need good wives and strong families. Only this sort of environment can give them the strength they need to perform their important function in society.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the Garot report on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat, I should like once again here to make clear reference to the shadow side of the report. The report, which basically makes provision for a compensation fund for pigfarmers, and hence goes beyond the Commission proposal, was adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I moved on behalf of our group for a split vote, as I personally reject the idea of a compensation fund for pigfarmers. I am quite happy to say yes to a piggy bank for pigfarmers, but I say ‘no’ to a compensation fund for pigfarmers, especially to a compensation fund co-financed from European money. I take the view that we do not need any more regulations or state intervention. The whole point of the free market is that supply and demand even out at a specific price. It is true that pigfarmers have been hit by an historic slump in prices. But it was preceded by a period of economic stability. A relatively limited supply, as the result of swine fever and the BSE debate and high exports to third countries have benefited prices and our farmers are again demanding that politics should keep out of it as far as possible. This is again a good starting point for proving it. To my mind, this is no time for hysteria. Every self-respecting agricultural textbook talks of two classical pig cycles. What we have seen over the last three years, albeit more drastically, is part of the classical pig cycle. The pigmeat market is now one of the few agricultural markets which is still basically free from state intervention. And the pigfarmers in my country are delighted at the fact. Setting up a compensation fund will quicken the concentration of European slaughter pig production considerably because the risk of bigger capital investments will shift to the common fund. I am aware of the fact that totally disparate agricultural philosophies apply in Europe; the philosophy of the federal system in Germany is quite different from that of the centralistic system in France. I am quite against the idea of co-financing by the EU. I am against any increase in state intervention. As for European regulations – as many as are needed, but as few as possible. What will we think up if there are any more agricultural risks, for example in the poultry sector? We cannot stuff money into a new EU piggy bank every time. That would indeed be the thin end of the wedge. Instead, it makes more sense if every pigfarmer sets up his own reserve, i.e. if every pigfarmer has his own piggy bank. That is what I should like to see.

 Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Bowis as rapporteur. We have heard various fine phrases quoted about diet. Let me offer one more: variety in moderation. The selection found on overflowing shelves has long since made this a genuine option. But the creation of a new authority or agency cannot change the eating habits of many members of the public, or the way we prepare and store food, or people's inadequate knowledge about preparing a balanced diet. Making food safer does not remove the need for consumers to act responsibly. Commissioner Byrne, it sounds to me as if we will have fewer and fewer producers but more and more inspectors. I am worried that Europe is again in danger of creating an overblown bureaucracy that is incapable of taking action. How exactly will the Agency's powers be divided with national inspection authorities? I am concerned that this will be another millstone round our necks. This new authority will not strike a blow for freedom in terms of consumer policy. Who will be suing whom in future food scandals? We are always discussing the division of powers in the context of enlargement of the European Union. But this concept also plays a key role in food safety. Strict application of the "polluter pays" principle will remain essential in repairing economic damage in future. The consistency of the White Paper on food safety leaves something to be desired in places. The timetable for achieving its objectives varies greatly according to the wishes of many stakeholders. So we will not stand in the way of establishing this body any more with today's debate. However, I do believe that we should not raise our hopes too high by imagining that this body will be a cure for all ills in future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of numerous food scandals, consumer awareness has heightened very considerably. In the domain of EU consumer policy, I believe ‘from stable to table’ has few rival claimants to the title of Expression of the Year. If, however, we want to apply this principle of transparency consistently, our commitment must stretch from the farmer’s pitch fork to the consumer's table fork. Consumer safety begins with animal feed, with its ingredients, the declaration and, last but not least, the official inspections. These three reports place us on the horns of a dilemma. As far as feed content is concerned, let me say that food safety is a highly sensitive issue. If scientific studies come out unequivocally against the use of certain substances, the precautionary principle must apply. I doubt, however, whether we shall succeed in introducing a zero-tolerance threshold. That would be dubious consumer protection and, what is more, it would surely be impracticable. I believe it would undermine the very legislation it was intended to reinforce. As for the declaration of feed materials – the open versus the semi-open declaration – our dilemma is surely between consumer protection and economic viability. With today’s analytical methods, Commissioner Byrne, any recipe is as transparent as can be. Any manufacturers who therefore wish to discover precisely what a competing company is offering its customers have long been able to acquire this information. I should like to conclude by dealing briefly with two problems relating to the declaration. The number of those who seek precise details on ingredients is relatively small, according to my research. This brings me to the other point. The full declaration certainly costs money, and the farmer ultimately has to foot the bill. The official feed inspections are the final link in the chain of transparency in the sphere of animal feed. Unfortunately, however, despite all our efforts, it will never be possible to completely eradicate criminal practices. For my own part, finally, the quality of our food concerns me less than the eating habits of our citizens in general.

 Mr President, Commissioner, it is not the label that counts. We all understand that expression, but what counts here really is the label – and I am not talking about haute couture! Beef labelling is an important stage in the process of rebuilding consumer confidence. I note that despite the protracted preliminary discussions not all EU Member States have recorded every last animal on their computers. Yet the compulsory labelling system is supposed to take force in all Member States as from 1 September 2000, thus finally replacing the voluntary system.  The question for consumers will be this: what information can we expect? Where was the animal born? In the EU, in a third country, at which farm, in what region? What does country of origin mean, or perhaps even source country? And then there is the debate about categories. Should I buy a sucking calf, a normal calf or a heifer today? As I come from a farming background myself and there is nothing I more earnestly want for farmers than stable prices, I believe that we should create legal bases that are underpinned by consensus. We should not make the legislation unnecessarily complicated. We are all concerned about public health and consumer protection.  So as from 1 September 2000 we will have labelling, and as from 1 January 2002 it will be extremely comprehensive. The beef chain from producer to consumer can be very long, and the supply chains in Member States vary widely. Yet I do not think that cattle headed for the slaughterhouse are really such great tourists. However, strict criteria must also apply to imports from third countries. By way of conclusion, let me say that I once learnt that top athletes’ nutrition programmes should include meat. Our top athletes’ eating habits have a great impact on health and performance. I hope that we can rebuild confidence and that people will once more become great meat-eaters.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products: this is where the Commission wants to combine the three existing internal market directives. The simplification of regulations as such, is only to be welcomed, yet the debate about tobacco has certainly taken on a very biased tone in many quarters. There is no doubt about it: our citizens must be protected against the damaging effects of tobacco consumption and given the appropriate warnings. I say that as a confirmed – but hopefully very tolerant – non-smoker and am wholeheartedly in support of this.   However, the debate about labelling is completely over the top to my mind. Every smoker is aware of the risks tobacco consumption poses to health. If people do not have the willpower themselves to give up cigarettes then as I see it, a statement covering a large area of the packet is not going to deter them from smoking either. Overdoing the statements will do neither the consumer nor the industry any favours.   The death’s head on the packet has no real bearing on whether or not someone decides to take up smoking. We need to hit the consumer where it hurts the most, which is the wallet in my view. Temptation is best tackled with a lack of money. If we do not want to drive the industry to take up the habit as well, then we must support an extension of the deadline for reducing the tar and nicotine content of tobacco products until December 2006.   The limit values proposed by the Commission for the year 2003 are not workable in our view. The tobacco industry in Europe constitutes a highly significant economic factor. I am therefore against putting companies at a disadvantage competitively, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission talks about harmonisation of internal market regulations, yet these small enterprises will be the ones to suffer the most from the stranglehold of special conditions and measuring procedures.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when our farmers read in the press that we in the European Parliament are debating agricultural prices for the 2000/2001 financial year, many will certainly cherish the hope that we might just be considering a few price increases. But that is not the case! In fact, we are discussing the proposals which the Commission has tabled following the Agenda 2000 reforms. May I, at this stage, specifically thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her work. Hitherto, people have regarded it as a routine annual exercise when we have had to debate prices for agricultural products. Year after year, blows were exchanged and, in that respect, I now welcome the fact that the fixed multiannual price proposals really can give farmers a rather more reliable framework in which to plan their production. However, I should like to warn you that, with this system, the annual review by the Council, the Commission and Parliament might not perhaps receive the attention which it deserves. The market situation, the outlook in the individual sectors and the trends in farm incomes as well as employment should continue to be examined by the European institutions on an annual basis. The proposals on setting institutional prices and monthly increments cover the products already mentioned. Most prices were fixed under Agenda 2000, but the Commission is proposing to cut the monthly increments for cereals by 7.5%. I should like to fully support the rapporteur’s stance in this regard. In our group’s view, the reduction in the monthly increments for cereals cannot be supported, not least because the Commission’s proposal undermines the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000. We should not continue to exert pointless pressure on farmers' incomes. I now turn to a topical issue, Commissioner Fischler, which is of interest to me. During the last plenary part-session, we once again discussed with Mrs Schreyer whether this EUR 300 million for reconstruction aid in Kosovo for 2001/2002 really could be taken out of the agriculture budget. I am familiar with the argument that we would save this amount because of the exchange rate mechanism. This was also reiterated when we were discussing the organisation of the market in sugar. But have I deduced correctly from the press that, at the beginning of last week, the Council in any case rejected this Commission proposal? I interpreted the press report as meaning that it did not support this, and I would be grateful to have the answer from your point of view, otherwise we will provoke a discussion here and debate the reality afterwards. Personally, I was extremely pleased at least by this admission from the Council at this stage.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I can be brief because, in the end, all the questions have been along the same lines. We have heard that the figure of EUR 1.8 billion was decided on in Berlin. Today, as you said, EUR 1.4 billion has been decided on, and we keep hearing about the EUR 300 million reallocated from the agriculture budget, i.e. the 2001-2002 agricultural sector. Commissioner, you had the opportunity to tell us about this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but my question is quite simply this: how do I then explain why the farming community is so agitated? When you state here today that we are saving a great deal of money thanks to the exchange rate mechanisms, when you and Commissioner Fischler say at the same time that we can save money in the organisation of the sugar market, then surely the reason the farming community is agitated must be that this information has not been properly conveyed to them, that the agricultural associations did not understand it properly! Or must we always and, on principle, begin with an exchange of blows when it comes to politics? I would therefore be very happy if we really could allay the concerns of farmers; at the moment, however, that does not seem to be the case!

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by very sincerely thanking Mr Pesälä for his statement, but I must say straight away that the thrust of my comments is somewhat different. We have a slogan in German which says ‘Milk cheers up tired chaps’. But you can also just say ‘Milk cheers you up’, because we now have some women in key positions in the Commission and that is why I would like to put on record my view that the Commission is now cheerfully planning to abolish export refunds for milk products too. The Commission is empowered to delete goods eligible for export refunds under the COMs for cereals, sugar, rice and eggs, for example. In the case of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty the list has been amended in this way. My question is this: is the Commission now seeking carte blanche 
for other products? I know that the Member States have taken widely differing views of this, not least in Council meetings. Is this really what is intended for the entire milk sector? I would be grateful if you could give me a couple of answers in a moment, when we consider whether this really is efficient. The Commission text indicates that additional administrative options are to be created, so as to facilitate more precise selection of those goods for which export refunds are to be granted. Would the Commission not agree that in this context the expression ‘efficient use’ is rather euphemistic? What does ‘efficient’ mean in plain language? In this case, “efficient” quite simply means abolishing export refunds for milk products. In practice it means that, for example, no export refunds will be granted for the milk part of fruit yoghurt. So I would like to ask if there is not a danger that without the milk export refund component export refunds for yoghurt will be reduced. Do you have real calculations and reliable figures for this? What will the situation be then? The rapporteur, Mr Pesälä, has, of course, already pointed out that this will also hit other products. There are also other export products, such as cakes and pastries, which contain milk components. So it sounds rather crazy to me if, on the one hand, we say that we must reduce costs while, on the other, it is possible, because more milk will remain on the market, 

that additional costs will have to be met for storage and so on. As I see it, excess production in the milk sector is likely to get worse rather than improve, and this gradual increase in minimum market access and the simultaneous reduction in the maximum export refund are rather contradictory. I am sure that you will be able to explain this in your statement in a moment. I believe that in terms of market policy there is no urgent need for this, and I can therefore see no reason why I should happily vote for this procedure or why it should be in the interests of the people I represent. I think I might find it rather difficult to explain to the farmers at home. So I would like to ask once more – is the abolition of these export refunds really unavoidable? Of course we agreed at the Berlin Summit that savings would have to be made, but surely in the right place. I am sure that you will be able to give us some answers in a moment.

Madam President, Commissioner. Food safety, product safety – I should like to dwell on this aspect. We know that meat production begins in the stall. The talk at present is of a total declaration of feedingstuffs. We have also seen that the feedingstuffs industry has gone straight on to the defensive because they say that what is being asked of them here is unrealistic. My question is this: how can we protect our farmers as producers if, in the final analysis, they do not know what they are feeding their animals and are then held liable?

Mr President, Commissioner, animal epidemics are not only important economic matters, they are also important from the point of view of consumer policy. Plus, animal epidemics are again costing us a great deal of money. The main objective of the directive is to create electronic data bases from which information on bovine animals and pigs, and how they are kept, can be accessed, in order to foster safety and transparency. These new data bases will form part of the bovine animal labelling and registration system set out in the regulation. However, as the implementation of this directive and the long-windedness of the codecision procedure have given rise to difficulties, the Commission has concluded that transitional measures should be introduced in order to avoid problems with the trade in live bovine animals and pigs. I agree with the rapporteur that Member States are always very slow to implement unwelcome Community legislation, which is why we need to discuss if a 3-year margin is really sensible. I think that Mr Daul’s proposed amendment of two years would be an excellent compromise. I should also like to point out in this connection that, rather than planting more trees, we need to clear the jungle of paragraphs and exemptions. Absolute account must be taken of the Economic and Social Committee’s reservations concerning strict limits on exemptions and harmonisation of veterinary legislation. I therefore fail to understand that some countries are doing their homework while others keep finding excuses and dragging their feet. All that does is distort competition and, for this reason, I vote that we make the regulation binding on everyone as quickly as possible.

Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy? As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition. Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988. We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle’s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support. However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter. Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions. When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs. The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain. The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction. According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources. Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs. Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes. People are especially wary of GMOs. We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly. First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment. Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said. And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs. A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer. Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice. We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety. By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence. I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments. Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.

 Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto. However, it has now achieved notoriety. The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest. We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate. I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany. If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual. What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region? What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice. However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage. The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree. What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.

Mr President, Commissioner, as far as the labelling of beef is concerned, we are not debating the substance here today but the timetable, which needs to be laid down. We are also debating the highly topical issue of the Council’s approach and the Commission’s behaviour and position. The Commission has submitted two proposals to us on beef labelling, one which makes beef labelling compulsory in Member States as of 1 January 2001 and one which is drafted as a transitional regulation up to 31 December 2000, i.e. voluntary labelling. The timetable submitted by the Commission must be rejected in the interests of the consumer. Mr Kindermann has submitted what I consider to be a convincing timetable. The European Parliament should agree to voluntary labelling up to 31 August 2000, with compulsory labelling to be introduced as quickly as possible. Only in this way can we send out a clear signal to anxious consumers. There can be no question of continuing to allow the slowest link in the chain to set the pace. Nor can there be any question of the new Commission continuing to hide behind what to me look very like the old delaying tactics. The delay in the implementation of the regulation cannot be ascribed solely to the Commission and individual Member States. In other words, this approach would have been totally unnecessary if the Commission had acted promptly at the time. Then there is the point that the applicable Regulation 820/97 still contains the obligation to introduce the compulsory system by 1 January 2000. The Commission’s excuse for the delay is that the Member States were late sending in the necessary reports on the implementation of the labelling system. I really do wonder if the model pupils in the Member States are again being punished here. We must not tolerate this cat-and-mouse game by the Commission any longer! You should know, Mr Byrne, that none of us can afford to put on such airs and graces. You should bear in mind that we really want to decide on this proposal under the codecision procedure. Consumer interests must come first. Consequently, we should, in my opinion, support the timetable suggested by Mr Kindermann in tomorrow’s vote. With this timetable we really can send a signal to our anxious consumers and we should all bear in mind that we sit here as the representatives of the people, that we have been elected by the consumers and that it is we Members of Parliament who must lay ourselves open time and again to discussions with our citizens. I have the impression that the Council has already distanced itself from them by quite some way.

Mr President, Commissioner, as the ban on placing BST on the market and administering it expires at the end of 1999, this matter has become a matter of urgency to us. This proposal is designed to definitively prohibit the marketing of BST and its administration to dairy cows. The Commission refers to scientific studies which confirm that the use of BST inflicts unnecessary pain on animals. Consequently, I reject the marketing and administration of BST in the European Union, as formulated in the report, on the grounds of animal welfare. May I remind you that all the Member States have approved and ratified an agreement on animal welfare on livestock holdings. BST use increases the incidence of mastitis and foot and leg disorders and adversely affects reproduction in cattle. There is also evidence of loss of profitability, premature culling and death. The numbers speak for themselves. BST increases the risk of mastitis by 25%, the risk of infertility by 18% and of paralysis by as much as 50%. However, there are not only animal welfare considerations; there are also health and economic considerations which justify the withdrawal of BST. BST is also rejected by consumers. It is reasonable to suppose that BST could lead to a change in consumption patterns and exacerbate the imbalance in the milk, milk products and beef and veal sectors. What is even more ridiculous is that surpluses are produced even under normal conditions. BST is not a treatment; its only purpose is to increase milk production. The milk quota system was introduced precisely in order to reduce milk production and now we are to take it ad absurdum with BST. That cannot be! Exports would also suffer. No major buyer or producer of milk and milk products anywhere in the world has permitted the use of this hormone, apart from the USA. We have been elected to represent our citizens and hence our consumers. We must therefore take our duty seriously and fight on behalf of the electorate. BST is a genetically engineered hormone. No Member State has yet carried out field tests with BST. It has not been established what changes could potentially occur in the composition of milk and the effects of genetic engineering on human health cannot yet be assessed. The fact that a small number of countries have allowed the hormone to be used must not lead to a watering down of international health standards. However, even more decisive is the fact that BST is rejected by consumers. It is not by chance that leading supermarket chains stated, following a consumer survey in 1994, that they would not sell milk from cows treated with BST, even if the EU moratorium were lifted. What we cannot, however, explain to consumers is that all the Member States of the European Union import a lot of BST milk products from the USA, together with products from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria, and that these products, for example, cheese from milk obtained this way, have been landing on our consumers’ tables for a long time. As third countries in which this hormone is permitted are not obliged to notify this officially, the Commission does not have an exhaustive list of these countries. I think this is another challenge facing the Commission. The Commission should check, first, if BST is harmful to human health and, secondly, how imports of BST products can be made really transparent. The Commission proposal has no effect on the production of BST in the Member States or on imports of this substance, provided that it is to be exported to third countries. Allow me, as your rapporteur, to conclude by saying that we all naturally find it difficult to explain to our voters that BST is already being manufactured in some Member States but that it is not used here. I am not sure if we should go into this point too critically in public, given that jobs are at stake. I hope – and we are at one with the Commission on this – that we can agree on this urgency and wrap the whole thing up tomorrow. Thank you to all those who were involved. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, I am reminded in this context of the saying: they cannot see the wood for the trees. It is reasonable that this directive needs to be updated as a result of the accession of new Member States and the development of the single market and forest research. It is reasonable that EU labelling should be harmonised in order to facilitate trade within the EU and with the OECD. But the directive takes no account of the differing needs of the Member States. In the view of our specialists in Germany, in the view of the German forestry industry and the forest nursery industry, this new directive will have a lasting negative impact. Monitoring should be confined to forest undertakings and should not, as the report provides, apply to all undertakings, as these requirements would then affect undertakings which produce no forest reproductive material at all. The willingness of successive farmers to plant forests in my region is receding sharply. This increasing prevalent basic attitude is dictated by financial considerations. I would just like to say to the House that I know what I am talking about because the forest economy has longed played an important role in our own undertaking and I would like in this context to point out the life-threatening situation in the Germany forest nurseries. Given the change in forestry in my country towards natural regeneration, massive cutbacks in planting requirements and a lack of public funds, I feel that I really must draw the House’s attention to this. The monitoring system is now supposed to be up and running by 2003. Our experts tell me that they think this deadline is too short. The directive is unacceptable in this respect; it fails to take account of geographical and regional differences within the EU. In northern countries we have to cope with huge forest areas with a single registration number, so that the new regulation holds no problem whatsoever in store for these areas. I would like to more or less keep to my allotted time, but we should bear in mind during the overall debate that we must not only take account of the Nordic point of view and we must not only consider the enthusiasm of mountain lovers in Austria; we in the middle of the EU, and this includes Germany, set great store by open clauses, so that the whole system can remain truly practicable.

Mr President, Commissioner, scientific checks in France have allegedly brought new findings to the subject of BSE. Allegedly! I am not a scientist, I am a farmer, a consumer, a politician, but I say to you quite candidly that I am not always ready to trust science for it is all too often the case that scientific findings come out in favour of the parties who commissioned the inquiry. There are countless examples of this in everyday life. I will give you one such example. We are currently awaiting the findings of the Scientific Committee with some trepidation and I believe that we will be continuing this discussion this evening and next week in Brussels. We all know the expression, “two lawyers, three opinions”. Where I come from, it goes, “two scientists, two opinions”. And for why? We once had a case of trying to find a location for a waste disposal site, the application for which had been turned down. The assessment of the district scientists was that the subsoil was watertight, while the local authority scientists maintained that the subsoil was as watertight as a bathtub without a plug! I admit that this topic is now actually far too serious. We can have a very emotional discussion here this morning on this subject of BSE, but this does nothing to help either British farmers or European consumers. It is also of little help when we, as European MEPs, refer to current contraventions of internal market regulations. An infringement of the Treaty is an important topic for all of us involved in European politics but, as an MEP in my constituency, I cannot use this at the moment as an argument to circumvent a political discussion on this topic. While we sit here and discuss this issue, we are driving more and more consumers away from the meat counter. As recently as the last plenary part-session, we made a renewed call for more stringent food safety and improved consumer protection. Commission President Romano Prodi made it clear during the debate that he would make the safety of foodstuffs his priority and the Commission wants to, and must, set up a new chapter in consumer policy. The most recent developments in the BSE crisis, in the “beef war”, involving not only France and Great Britain but Germany as well, where the federal Länder
 are currently adopting a very negative attitude, clearly demonstrate, Mr Fischler and Mr Byrne, too, the difficult task that we are faced with and the enormous challenge we have before us of creating a responsible and transparent consumer policy. Economic interests represent one side of the coin, consumer protection the other. I nevertheless believe, as I also said at the beginning, as a practical person I have a great deal of trouble with the results, that we should take the objections of the authorities very seriously. I eagerly await the outcome of this evening.

 Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, consumers are living ever longer lives and are becoming ever healthier at more advanced ages. In spite of this, the subject of food safety is high up on the agenda. I believe that producers and consumers are in the same boat here, for the producers are themselves also consumers. That is something we sometimes forget in the overall discussion. Losses in the cattle and meat industry due to falling sales caused by constant public discussion of these matters are, however, unsustainable in the longer term.  In Germany, a country in which animal corpses and waste from slaughterhouses are recycled in the appropriate manner, the discussion of animal feed has now become a macabre media spectacle. Unappetising pictures, together with headlines about the everyday cycle of horror in disgusting factories, are increasingly marginalising meat production and the practice of keeping livestock on farms. The fact is that, in a number of countries, sewage sludge is now also being declared a biomass and animal feed enriched with this is driving the last customer away from the meat counter. Feedingstuffs legislation is part of a quite distorted picture. I appeal to you and to us all. We can no longer skulk in dark corners. That must be our maxim! Should the consumer really be convinced, in the future too, that farm animals have been reduced to the status of interim depositories for dubious feedingstuffs? Is the consumer to go on thinking that we in the EU close down farms and so give up cultivating cereal, but burn the corpses of our animals and use meat and bone meal as animal feed? I cannot begin to imagine that, in this period of innovation, we cannot find new and different ways of disposing of waste.  Our farmers certainly do not want this policy. Should the consumer then continue voluntarily supporting this practice through his consumption of meat? He will simply not do this, and for ethical, moral and emotional reasons. Declining to use meat and bone meal as animal feed benefits both producer and consumer. Voluntarily refusing to be involved in such processes is something which is already seen to be having a very positive influence upon the way in which meat is advertised.  I shall say one more thing: as far as I am concerned, food is not superfluous junk. Food is now already being wasted, partly because of production costs. This state of affairs also has a bad effect upon European agriculture. Mr Prodi, it is not acceptable to deceive consumers again, as in the dioxin scandal. We need an entirely clear information policy in all Member States. The tactic of covering up these matters really must be brought to an end. I fully support you when you say that we need a comprehensive system of labelling. This should include everything of relevance to the consumer. But we also need reasonable prices so that both producer and consumer are in accord with one another.

 Mr President, Commission representatives, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by personally thanking the representatives of the Commission and Council for their excellent cooperation over the last two years. I had the opportunity to work on these dossiers with both the Italian and the Irish Presidencies, to which I am grateful for an outstanding and comradely piece of cooperation. What is it all about? The four regulations we have before us are an important part of the measures to improve food safety in the European Union. They were drawn up with the aim of replacing 17 directives and making the law more coherent and more science- and risk-based. Do the texts produced by the Commission, Council and Parliament meet those requirements? I believe they do. I believe we have created an excellent legal base. The effects may be described as follows: Firstly, there is greater legal certainty. The proposals build on tried and tested practices with additional measures for greater food safety, but the crucial thing is that they are a new legislative concept. The choice of a regulation, which means that the same text applies everywhere in the European Union, was a decisive step for greater coherency and less bureaucracy. That the Commission, Council and Parliament have agreed to expand the mandatory parts of all requirements is very much to be welcomed. This will enable firms involved to act with greater legal certainty. When requirements are constantly changing, that is of immense importance. Parliament’s efforts to limit the scope for amending the annexes in the comitology procedure must also be seen as part of this approach for stability and legal certainty. We have found a more or less acceptable arrangement. I can, however, also assure you that we shall be watching the use of comitology for amending the annexes very critically. Legal certainty must be the main concern. We do of course need flexibility as well to be able to respond to new dangers and new situations. I believe we have that, too. The second principle behind the new food safety rules is in the interests of all concerned. The introduction of the ‘from farm to table’ principle, self-inspection by businesses with the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principle and of guides, and the greater attention paid to scientific findings are the essence of the new approach. Everyone concerned is brought into the system. However, the new system also takes account of the type of production process and the guarantees offered by the food business operator. That is why the new approach is also marked by greater flexibility. The fact that exemptions and variations are possible is not inconsistent with the aim of improving food safety. They are, however, only permitted for traditional production methods in difficult remote areas, that is, in places where remoteness of location or the mountainous nature of the region brings its own problems, and of course where local markets are supplied. The great variety of means of production in the European Union can be taken into account. I believe that making this dependent on the competent authority’s risk assessment was a wise approach. I will mention only in passing that the Council and Commission have slightly watered down the ‘from farm to table’ principle in as much as the HACCP procedure will not be mandatory in primary production. I believe we have managed to find a wise solution here, too, in leaving the arrangements to the Member States. In accordance with this ‘low requirements for low risk’ approach, however, we should give small businesses the assurance that evidence of the results of the HACCP principle can be provided in a form acceptable to the firm. I am referring here to recital 15 of Common Position No 1 on the food hygiene regulation, according to which good hygienic practices can replace monitoring of critical control points. I consider this arrangement especially suitable for artisanal small businesses. The official veterinarian is central to the proposed system of official supervision of meat production. He performs audits and inspections so that the requirements of the relevant provisions can be observed by all concerned. The official veterinarian must have the statutory means to enforce the requirements. This also means that the legal texts must lay down clear criteria for his decisions. That is why it is important that Parliament has included the basic tasks of official controls in Article 3. The veterinarian and official specialised assistants must also show evidence of a high level of expertise. I believe this is right. In some Member States, however – and that is already evident – this will require a change to veterinary training. The authorities in the Member States should also act quickly to ensure that enough personnel are available to be able to comply with the wide-ranging regulations. So far as I am aware, only a few countries currently have the staff to perform such tasks as the rule we have adopted about the conditional approval of establishments. Let me make this clear: with their current staffing levels the authorities will not be able to check three times in six months that an establishment meets the approval requirements. Another thing required of the competent authority is the integration of controls. It is no longer enough to concentrate on the enforcement of statutory provisions. The involvement of businesses in food safety matters also requires greater flexibility on the competent authority’s part. The business operator should see himself as a partner and be seen as one. That cannot be legislated for by statute, but the foundations for greater food safety through cooperation have been laid. One point was a matter of dispute for a long time: the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in official controls. I am aware – and I am speaking here as a parliamentary rapporteur – that the compromise that has been reached may not meet with this House’s approval. There are a number of reasons for this. Some say, for example, that this rule will not help us in what we have always been trying to do, that is, to improve food safety indeed, that it will have quite the opposite effect. The regulation on official controls of feed and foodstuffs requires those carrying out official controls to act independently. The establishment’s staff are dependent on the head of the establishment. Staff training restricts the veterinarian and therefore hampers his ability to make controls. There remains the question of costs. Does the operator really save inspection costs? I do not believe so. All the calculations show the opposite. I think, gentlemen of the Council, that we should agree here to come back to this and try to clarify it in perhaps two or three years’ time. Since this regulation brings much that is new to the Member States and will require a lot of adjustment by all concerned, we should first apply it for two or three years and then concentrate on this question again. I think we should use the existing outcome and adopt these regulations in this legislative period without further discussion. They are an important foundation for food safety. As the Commissioner has now arrived, I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: my sincere thanks to you and your colleagues for your extraordinarily close cooperation in working on the texts of these regulations. I think it is a good piece of work and we will come much closer to our objective of improving food safety in Europe.

 Mr President, we are voting on the Paulsen report today. It was only this morning that the amendments to this report became available in all languages. I regard this as a very important report and there are a great many amendments. I am not in a position to adopt a clear position on this report today, and I therefore request that the vote should be postponed until tomorrow.
Schnellhardt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Paulsen report not so much because of its content – with which I was not totally familiar– than as a reaction to the procedure. After the vote in committee, we were faced with a result that made implementation of the regulation impossible. That was a reflection of the widely varying opinions of the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. At the rapporteur’s request, the Council has now, and somewhat unusually, brought forward a new text in advance of the vote in the House. The rapporteur agreed this text with four of the groups in Parliament and presented it to this House in what I see as a very undignified manner, with new versions of the English text being presented day after day over the last week. It was not until this morning that all the changes, that is to say changes in the form of the Council text, were presented to Parliament. We are now looking at a totally new legislative text that has not been discussed in committee beforehand. This House has had no opportunity whatsoever to adopt a position on this text in committee; instead, the text was immediately presented to the House with adoption today by a non-qualified majority vote. If we made this system the rule, then we would certainly have a very rapid procedure, and we could deal with all legislative texts within four weeks. The Council would just have to present a text, four Members of this House would nod it through, and the whole House would vote for it, because it would not be possible to address its actual content. I regard this way of proceeding as extremely dangerous, because the hallmark of a parliament is the way it debates a topic and its diversity of opinion. It cannot amount to a dictatorship by a handful of people in the groups, who explain overnight at a group meeting what is in the text, without anyone knowing exactly what is actually being voted on. I urge you to think about this and only to permit this procedure in exceptional cases in future. I can of course understand that Mrs Paulsen is anxious to put her report to bed, because she is not coming back. However, she could also have achieved that by talking to me. But that is not what happened. I hope you will take this point on board and reject any such procedure in future.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, this proposal sees us continuing a tradition of this House. We have, in the past, been very thorough in campaigning for a reduction in the emission of pollutants from motors, and now we want to deal with stationary apparatus and mobile machines, an area that has not hitherto been covered. Combating these pollutants, or actually reducing them, has no profound influence on potential pollution overall, but it is significant, in that these machines and pieces of apparatus are highly localised and are generally in use for a considerable period of time. This results in heavy local pollution, which is detrimental – particularly through particulates and nitrogen oxides – to people’s health. This is something we should constantly bear in mind. I can tell Mr Lange that we should be rather more cautious here, and that this is where we should not allow ourselves to be misled into presenting specific technical solutions as especially effective in reducing the emission of pollutants. Not only do we have to cut pollutants, but we also have to think about reducing CO2 in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. We know that installing filters increases the output of CO2. This, surely, is where a compromise has to be found, so that, while calling for a reduction, we nonetheless have to keep asking ourselves to what extent we have to approach this problem only from this direction. I can agree with the specification that the rapporteur has proposed, and we should continue to take this robust line. I can remember how, in 1998, it was prophesied that Europe’s oil sector would collapse; yet it ended up being quicker off the mark than the timescale we had proposed. Our approach is without doubt the right one. I am rather more cautious about extending this to railways and boats, where I am sure that there are still some open questions. We are attempting to move more goods on to rails and boats. We also know that public transport also has to be covered – a sector that makes particular use of rail vehicles. These, though, produce pollutants, and it is on these that we want to impose rules. We will have to re-examine this. That is why the proposal is right to include such vehicles; had it not done so, approving it would have been a bit more difficult. This way, we can agree on a common denominator.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what is at issue today is not the profits made by enterprises or conglomerates, but our gaining, at last, the length and breadth of Europe, a single legal framework which will enable genetically-modified foods and feedingstuffs to be authorised, labelled, and traced. This will give all participants in the market – including consumers – a guarantee of legal certainty; it may have come very late in the day, but I hope it is not too late. In terms of the practical implementation of this technology, we Europeans are over ten years behind developments in other countries, while our researchers are without doubt equal to the best in the world. To put it another way, what this amounts to is that research findings have been left unused for ten years, and research in Europe has been scrapped, especially into green genetic engineering, even though the usefulness of this is not a matter of dispute. As Mr Davies has given a number of examples of this, I do not need to do likewise. Over recent years, however, public discussion has not been about the pros and cons of genetic engineering, but has instead been a campaign mounted along ideological lines, aimed at obstructing a modern and forward-looking technology, so it is not to be wondered at that the results of surveys show the majority regarding genetic engineering as the work of the devil and abominating it. A number of interventions in this House today gave me the feeling that the plague was on its way back to Europe. We have to be very careful here. This situation means that it is perfectly reasonable that the regulations should contain very stringent rules on authorisation, labelling, and traceability, even though these threaten to break the bounds of practical feasibility. The reason why I say this is that I think that we, simply by applying very stringent measures, are guaranteeing the absolute maximum of safety that is practically feasible – and this is something that we also need to tell the public over and over again in the information campaign. Although the information requirements provided for in the regulations are certainly an important means towards this end, I would like to appeal also to the Commission and say that I too regard Europe-wide information campaigns as necessary, as Mrs Breyer has announced a campaign for a moratorium on buying GM products. If the labelling of these products results only in their being rejected, we will certainly not be able to catch up on the rest of the world. Whilst this compromise motion is certainly an intelligent solution, I do have my doubts – and a number of interventions seem to justify them – as to whether it will succeed. When it comes to drawing up guidelines – and I can tell the Commission that I am agog to see what will happen when they do – there will be a lot of hard work to be done; it will not be easy, and I hope it does not turn out to be a bureaucratic monster. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly congratulate the three rapporteurs, among whom I would like to single out Mrs Klaß, whose report demonstrates some very good ways of approaching this issue. I know from my own personal experience the different preconceptions that have to be taken into account when considering issues of labelling. I would particularly like to highlight the rules on labelling for products that trigger allergic reactions. In the European Union, 8% of children and 3% of adults suffer an allergic reaction to food ingredients to such an extent that it markedly affects their general state of health, and that is an alarming statistic. When it comes to keeping consumers informed, labelling is the only option in view of the large number of compound foodstuffs, the composition of which changes frequently. Unlike the previous speakers, I am in favour of the continued addition of ingredients that, it simply has to be said, improve the quality of the meal. That products should be listed only if there is scientific evidence that they trigger allergies goes without saying; we should also ensure that the list can be amended quickly when new findings come to light. It should always be borne in mind that the plethora of information on a label has to communicate the essentials. In this perspective, I look forward with keen anticipation to learning what the Commission thinks about the inclusion on labels of, for example, unproven assertions. This is where there could well be a reduction in the amount of information provided. May I just make one additional observation? In 1998, as a rapporteur, I tried to bring in rules on the labelling of alcoholic drinks; the sole issue then was the labelling of sulphur. What was, at that time, seen as revolutionary is now no longer an issue; proof that Parliament has, in recent years, come round much more to the consumers’ way of thinking. Furthermore, I welcome the proposal for labelling where the proportion of an ingredient is in excess of 2%. Although this was, years ago, regarded as impossible, and may well not be necessary, we are now taking account of the tendency to use many ingredients in small quantities in the production process, and we are discharging our obligation to inform the consumer. Businesses with whom I have had discussions have told me that most labels now include ingredients the proportion of which is under 2%. I would just like to make a brief comment on the Olsson report; I welcome Mr Olsson’s accommodating approach and see it as a good thing, but I am also aware that oestradiol 17β is already being replaced by other substances in many countries in the European Union. That is something that we should be encouraging and promoting.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking those who did such an excellent job of helping me with this report – Members in the political groups, the Commission and the Council. I was pleased to hear the remarks of the Commissioner as well, because they seem to go in the same direction that we wish to take. The proposal for a regulation is an integral and important part of the overall endeavour to improve food safety within the EU, product quality in third countries exporting to the EU and to establish European food legislation. Its primary aim is to achieve better protection for consumers in relation to food products of animal origin for human consumption, and, as the Commissioner mentioned, the official veterinarian is at the heart of the system of official controls. I think that he has the right technical qualifications and this approach is therefore to be welcomed. The very detailed demands made on official veterinarians will have to lead to changes in study courses in the Member States. They are also necessary to ensure that scientific knowledge can be transposed into practice. We should however be careful that official veterinarians, who have been carrying out their responsibilities conscientiously for many years, do not have to take more exams as a result of this proposal for a regulation. The veterinarians are assisted by official auxiliaries in carrying out their inspections. For this to work successfully, it is important that both groups of people can work independently. Monitoring bodies that are in some way dependent on the business that is being monitored cannot, with the best will in the world, take an independent decision. This is why I am firmly rejecting the idea that the establishment’s own staff can be used or deployed in inspecting the slaughter of pigs and bovine animals in place of official monitors. Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, you have plainly been guided by financial constraints on this point. We have set out to increase food safety in the EU and with these measures you are going to achieve exactly the opposite, which is why we have to reject them. We should remember that only precise independent findings through official controls focus more on the new concept of national, and ultimately European, risk analysis and are a key element in risk management. This is also the basis upon which the effectiveness of the European Food Safety Authority depends. The situation is different with the mandatory application of food business operators’ own controls as an element of strengthening their individual responsibility for the wholesomeness and high quality of their products. It should therefore be possible, where there is a reduced risk and own controls are taking place, to restrict official controls to checks on the findings of these own controls. This should be a free decision for the competent authority to take and not compulsory. A risk-based flexible approach in official controls, based on the wholesomeness of the business’s products, should always be the most important factor. This is much better than an approach based on the intensity of production and also serves to strengthen the position of the competent authority. Things are again different when traditional production methods are used on farms with lower production and in outlying geographical areas. Here, the possibility of implementing the regulation is often restricted. Exceptions to the rules should, however, be limited to flexibility in the attendance of an official inspector and the forwarding of information. A reduction in hygiene levels cannot be accepted under any circumstances. The concept of 'from stable to table' is an important basis for a high level of food safety. The effectiveness of the system is dependent upon the quality of information going from the farmer to the shop, but – and I would like particularly to draw your attention to this – also back to the farmer. This is essentially a new approach, one that requires constant emphasis. The information should, however, be limited to criteria that are important for inspection of the slaughter and food safety. Information about medical treatment which does not have food safety implications, for example the administering of iron tablets to piglets, does not have to be provided, reducing the amount of information involved. I think that the greater inclusion of scientific competence in the food production process guarantees that the necessary information is submitted, which may well turn out to be different in each case. A contentious issue in the EU until now has always been the number of staff for inspections, particularly in slaughterhouses. I think that we should ask the Commission to make an objective proposal here along the lines of regions and farms. I know that it is very difficult, but it cannot be avoided. I am convinced that the new approach will, in any case, lead to an improvement in food safety in the EU. I am grateful for the cooperation I have enjoyed, and I thank all of you for your attention. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have spent over twenty-five years working on protection for European consumers, and not a Parliamentary sitting goes by without consumer issues being discussed. I know I am disagreeing with some of those who have spoken today when I say that the rules that have worked for years have proved their worth and that their effects live on, even though they ended up as a legal package of which nobody could get an overview, and there are still some loopholes. The Commission is therefore right, by means of the proposals on consumer protection, to seek ways out of the confusion and suggest what some of those ways might be. I want to put the case for a framework directive with a comprehensive clause founded on the principles of sound business practice. More and more frequently, the internal market ends up being handicapped as a result of the lack of regulations or the leeway left by the directives. It is particularly in view of enlargement that measures need to be taken to remedy this as soon as possible, and there is a need to combat not only unfair business practices that affect consumers, but also those used by all participants in the internal market on each other. This latter category would include the attempts made by some Member States to use the protection of consumers or their health as a shield with which to protect national markets and industries from competition. There are also those who call themselves campaigners for consumers' rights who allow themselves to be engaged in this cause and help to drive competitors from the market. That is why I believe it necessary to make greater use of the legal form of a Regulation in order to achieve greater legal certainty. That will also lead to harmonisation, and that is what we need in the internal market. The Commission has drawn up a comprehensive list and appended it as an annex. All the points in it are important, but the new priorities in the Whitehead Report introduce a succession of others, ranging from important to less important. What Mr Whitehead has said today has actually contradicted this order of priorities. Consumers can avail themselves of their rights only when they know what those are. Work on consumer protection should make information policy a priority. Consumers' associations have an important part to play in this, and governments must support them in it. It is because of their failure to do this that we have to set up these consumer centres in our Member States if we are to make progress in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the Commission for the clarity with which it has presented the situation as regards the treatment of foodstuffs with ionising radiation in the European Union. I am also grateful to the Commissioner for the clarity of what he has had to say about this problem area. As long ago as 1999, when we were working on the directive, our fear was that the Commission would not succeed in producing a comprehensive positive list by 31 December 2000. And what has happened? It will soon be 31 December 2002, and, rather than discussing whether or not to adopt the list, we are again going over the discussions we had in the days before the directive was drawn up. Things cannot, I believe, be left as they stand, and the situation is unacceptable. The Commission, in its communication, notes that both the FAO and the WHO regard it as scientifically proven that irradiation is quite safe for consumers. The WHO, indeed, urges that it be used more, as the procedure reduces risks to the consumer. The Scientific Committee on Food notes, with reference to 17 product categories, that treatment with ionising radiation is harmless, and those categories include all those products treated to date in the countries of the European Union. It states that there have been no occasions on which the critical dose has been exceeded in the European Union. It is noted in the Commission communication that the most important conditions for treatment with ionising radiation – licensing, labelling and control – have been met and that the methods for detecting irradiation have been validated, in other words, that they also meet requirements. I am slowly finding it intolerable that we are constantly, in this context, being told that there is the possibility of cheating, that there is room for fraud and so on. The detection methods are in place. We can determine whether products have been treated, be it legally or illegally. Why, then, do we constantly have to go over this discussion again and again? We see, then, that all the conditions have been met for a positive list to be drawn up and for the Commission to deal with it. The Commission, though, is getting cold feet. The reasons for this are apparent from the survey that it has carried out, which, to take one example, discovered that the food manufacturers do not want this treatment. Why, then, do they not want it? As the communication makes perfectly clear, they fear a boycott of their products, as the European Union and this discussion itself have been permeated by an ideology which ignores all the scientific findings and simply refuses to accept all that has been worked out and set out to date. And so we go back to our discussions and to bemoaning this dreadful state of affairs. It is then that the hygiene argument is produced. I helped draw up the directive on hygiene conditions in the handling of fresh meat. I would be the last person to want to cut anything out here, but we discussed HACCP when we worked on the current version of the food hygiene directive. It is perfectly clear to us that this is not acceptable everywhere, and that we have to use other methods as well in order to make products safer for consumers. That is what this procedure is there for. The only acceptable approach is for the Commission to draw up the positive list very quickly, and, moreover, not in the form it has now proposed. The real need is for change in the situation in the European Union. We cannot afford to keep on being weighed down by this ideological ballast.
Schnellhardt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you are quite right. We have very considerable experience of the use of traditional herbal medicinal products. In the European Union, consumers attach ever greater importance to the use of them. This is why, in my view, it is time to establish a harmonised legal framework for traditional herbal medicinal products. For far too long, trade in these traditional products within the Community has been hampered by differences in the national provisions. I think that in its current form, the directive will correct this imbalance, thanks not least to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Nisticò. Let me touch upon two points which are, in my view, especially important. Firstly, the establishment of a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products: I believe this is a necessary step, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has opted in favour of this approach. One of the committee's most important tasks will be to set up a list of herbal substances. However, I also think that the classification into various groups, as called for by the committee, is especially important. I very much hope that we can achieve this further classification. The phytopharmaceuticals with what is termed 'well-established medicinal use' 
should be included in the group of rational phytopharmaceuticals. Let me briefly explain the significance of this distinction: in the case of phytopharmaceuticals with well-established use, monographs containing generally available data can be presented as evidence for an application. No extract-specific data are required in this type of evidence. A different situation applies to rational phytopharmaceuticals. In this case, evidence is provided through the presentation of specific extract-related data which describe the precise effect of the individual extract. In order to avoid distortions of competition – and I think this is especially important – the manufacturer, who has invested substantial sums in researching the effects of rational phytopharmaceuticals, should be permitted to draw attention to his special efforts as part of the registration process, thus benefiting consumers through the provision of better product information.
Schnellhardt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to compliment both rapporteurs on their excellent work. I believe that these proposals provide a good basis for ensuring that the internal market in medical products operates properly for medicines for both human and veterinary use. As far as I am concerned the hallmark of an internal market is not price stability, but comparable prices, which is something altogether different and really has nothing to do with the internal market. These proposals will also give a continuing boost to research, making research worthwhile again and also enabling manufacturers of generic drugs to make a living. I also believe that these proposals will make it possible to take advantage of all the options for maintaining public health. Harmonising data exclusivity in the European Union will particularly promote research, and at the same time make the task of generic drug manufacturers easier. I fully support this and those affected should not need to make any further demands. However, as I see it, extending the centralised authorisation procedure for medicinal products, as advocated by the Commission in committee, is not in accordance with the principles that have been mentioned. The present twofold authorisation procedure fully meets the requirements of the internal market and guarantees a greater variety of medicinal products, and with lower charges. The new plan to impose use of the centralised procedure for products with new active substances will undermine competition between the authorisation procedures. We can include as many processing deadlines as we like in the regulation, but without any competition these figures are meaningless. I know a great many SMEs that carry out research and in particular companies that are doing research and development in the field of ‘orphan drugs’ or veterinary medicines. That is where active substances of this kind are developed. Authorisation for these would have to be applied for in London, and I believe that these companies cannot afford that, nor can they put it into practice. So what we will end up achieving is to halt this kind of research, which really is not acceptable. We should therefore refuse to support the change proposed here.

Mr President, honourable Members, as a member of parliament from one of the regions affected by the floods, I am very grateful that this debate is being held here today. Here we are, worrying about how to get money to the victims. That shows that, as a community, the European Union basically functions on the principle of solidarity. I should also like to make a point of thanking Commission President Prodi for having visited the damaged regions in person. His visit clearly demonstrated that the European Union is alive and well and ready to help and did much to raise the stock of the European Union. The local citizens saw that Europe is a dynamic force for help. I visited some of the damaged areas last week in preparation for today's debate and spoke to citizens and those in charge. The devastation is immense and the people are in deep despair. But they draw hope for a new beginning from the overwhelming sense of solidarity already shown in Germany and from the support coming in from further afield, including from the European Union, because they cannot cope with these problems alone. The bottom line – I have been told time and again – is that money is needed, and needed fast. Apart from replacing personal property lost, we need, first and foremost, to ensure that infrastructures are restored as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the losses to business. Apart from cheap loans, which the Commissioner has already mentioned, I think we need to do more to ensure the money flows quickly. One way would be to provide funds from the supplementary budget or from the disaster fund which has already been discussed here today. This money needs to be provided in the short term. The second way of providing funds is through the Structural Funds. I think both channels are important and are the right approach. However, in the case of the Structural Funds, we need to bear in mind that, under current legislation, the Structural Funds can only be implemented if there is 50% cofinancing. This cofinancing is entered in the countries' budgets in annual tranches and the corresponding funds are then earmarked. Additional funds cannot be provided in the short term. Which is why using the Structural Funds only makes sense if cofinancing is altered. What we need is a reduction, and I do not mean by a couple of percentage points; we need a drastic reduction just for this period, i.e. while funds are being used to repair the damage. Nonetheless, the question of providing more money from the Structural Funds over coming years needs to be reviewed, as Mrs Krehl has already said. I think that if we take this on board, we shall have a huge opportunity to help people and win their confidence in the European Union. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the identification of food ingredients issue is one that recurs in Parliament on a regular basis. When a major amendment to the labelling directive was decided on in 1995, there were similar discussions on the same issues as are on the agenda today. In my view, though, today's discussions are necessary simply because there has been an increase in people's allergic reactions to certain component foods, some of which have been a threat to life itself. This alone makes amendment of the directive and other measures necessary. In my estimation, the production processes have remained unchanged since 1995. What has changed is Parliament's attitude, as, at that time, we were already debating the rights and wrongs of the 25% rule. That is no longer an issue today, so we are – I think – going back to 5%, which ensures that consumers can be certain of spotting allergenic substances that are a danger to them, and that is the whole point of this amendment. That is why we should carry on along this road. Today, though, we are back to walking the tightrope between clarity and the need for information, by which I mean firstly the clarity of the label and secondly that of the directive. The consolidated version 2013/EC was a superfluous piece of legislation, and, in my view, so complex that anyone starting to apply this directive needs the help of someone learned in the law in order to accomplish it properly. Please do not misunderstand me: I know of no amendment that we should be making other than this one. I would like, however, to sharpen our awareness so that we can consider, in view of the next amendment to the labelling directive being imminent, whether there are not essential things that we could leave off the label because the public now know a good deal more than once they did. When the public enter a hostelry, restaurant or bar, where mixed drinks and many varieties of food are prepared, we work on the assumption that they know what is in them and can also find out by asking. That is an approach that we might perhaps take to what lies ahead when the next amendment comes round; I believe it is nearly upon us. I am thinking of such things as alcoholic drinks.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission and my fellow Members here in Parliament very sincerely for their highly constructive and expert cooperation. The reports before us reflect that cooperation, and they represent part of the framework needed for safe food production, especially in health terms. While we are sitting here today at this hour discussing measures for greater food safety, people throughout the European Union are sitting in restaurants or at home and enjoying their food, and are unlikely to be asking if their food is safe. In fact our food is safe, safer than in many other places in the world. The Commissioner has seized the opportunity given to us by the crises we have experienced recently – and we have indeed been through a great deal over the last few years – to develop a new strategy. Quite rightly so, but these crises alone should not be the reason for us to adopt new food legislation, because they are history now and virtually no one is writing about them any more. What is far more important is that changes in food production and also changes in consumer behaviour are forcing us to consider how we can make food production safer, as the public has different requirements and increasing demands are being made for greater safety. In spite of the many rules already in place, it has to be said that there are many shortcomings in the way the Community has shaped food law up to now. The individual rules are each limited to a specific sector, but there is no overall plan. Community food law is especially notable for its significant deficiencies as regards coherence and legal certainty. These deficiencies are not just a matter of drafting, they are really substantial and they put at risk the efficiency and implementation of food law. That is all the more reason for welcoming the radical new concept proposed by the Commission in its White Paper, which on closer inspection turns out to be not so much a new safety concept as a new legislative concept. For the first time, general food law is being proposed at Community level, with uniform definitions and principles and without any ifs and buts. This food law is based on a comprehensive and uniform concept ranging from the producer to the consumer and it creates a coherent and transparent set of food law provisions. The consolidation process has also been used to make fundamental improvements in the quality of a great deal of the legislation up to now. I regard this consolidation of the hitherto incoherent body of rules and regulations to create consistent food law as being essential. In the context of food hygiene, we need legal bases that can easily be applied by food business operators, that permit an exchange of information between individual production levels, that correspond to the conditions of the internal market, and which are accordingly valid in all Member States, which increase the responsibility of food business operators, and which facilitate the official control activities of the authorities and guarantee the implementation of administrative measures. The regulation reforming the law is essential to achieve all this. Parliament will not agree to any change here. Encompassing the existing 17 directives in just four regulations will result in a sharper definition of the borders between food hygiene, animal health law, official food controls and thus user-friendly legal bases. This also reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of the economic sectors affected. Most producers nowadays operate on an international basis. A regulation provides a uniform framework for action with the same provisions governing all the EU Member States and accordingly, more than a directive can do, establishes fair conditions throughout the European internal market. The new food law can only take account of special national and regional situations in exceptional cases, which is something I would particularly like to emphasise. The Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs was significantly modified by the committee, with almost 200 amendments, and I believe that this regulation now provides a better legal basis. Many of the amendments are based on the text of the Regulation laying down general principles on food hygiene which has already been adopted, and were accordingly chiefly amendments needed for drafting reasons. There is a common thread running through all the proposals for regulations, and that is the emphasis on the primary responsibility of food producers for the safety of the foodstuffs they place on the market. The BSE crisis in particular did a great deal to demonstrate that we have failed to impose the same responsibility on those involved in primary agricultural production that we have long since expected of food producers elsewhere in the production chain. I believe that the HACCP principle is also relevant here. I am of course aware that the HACCP principle can only be applied to primary production in a few areas. However, in farms with significant numbers of animals it is possible to identify the critical points that need constant monitoring. If we apply the 'from farm to table' principle, we would also ensure that the scope for self-regulation is also fully used in primary production. The Commission's proposals suggest that HACCP should not be applied to primary production, whereas the regulations before us contain general provisions on hygiene for primary production. This implies a totally new chapter in the legislation on food hygiene. For example, if a farmer has to keep a record of measures for containing risks, that amounts in certain areas to the first step towards the application of the HACCP principle. Despite the high level of safety standards and seamless controls, production errors cannot be totally avoided. If the causes are to be established, the traceability of products must be guaranteed. The committee considers that additional labelling such as that proposed in the Commission proposal is not necessary. Although systems of labelling for traceability may vary from one EU Member State to another, they all guarantee a seamless picture of the production chain. I gathered from Commissioner Byrne's statement on Monday that product labelling is to be simplified, which suggests that the committee's proposal is actually to be adopted. In order to support production processes, the regulation provides for guidelines for good practice. As a rule these will be sectoral and national guidelines which are to be drawn up by many interested parties. The application of these guidelines is of course voluntary, and this House supports that. However, if European guidelines are drawn up for a specific sector or a specific area of production, then those guidelines would have to emerge from a general consensus and would have to reflect best available practice in Europe. That is why sectoral, national or regional guidelines should be replaced by European guidelines, because in that way we can compel food producers to apply precisely this best practice and to introduce these methods. Food production in Europe is very diverse, and it is therefore necessary for the regulations to permit a certain degree of flexibility. That is why it would be possible for there to be exceptions from the provisions of these regulations. Parliament wishes to limit these exceptions to regions with geographically difficult situations and to regions with supply difficulties, and also to traditional production methods and to supplies for local markets. The procedure for approving exceptions should be a simple one. However, Parliament cannot agree to uncontrollably broad powers for the Commission to amend the appendices of this regulation on food hygiene which define the basic framework of hygiene conditions by following the comitology route. In theory it would possible be to amend the appendices again only one day after the regulations were adopted. An arrangement of this kind would certainly not be in the spirit of good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission. However, the procedure needs to be different for the regulation on specific hygiene rules. These annexes cover detailed issues regarding hygienic trade in food, and in this case rapid implementation has to be achieved by means of amendment through the committee procedure. We have therefore taken various areas – definitions, approval of plants, labelling and so on – out of the annexes and incorporated them into the articles of the regulation, so that if any amendments are needed this can only be done by means of legislation. But I am content for other rules to be dealt with through the committee procedure. One of the main points with regard to the regulation on specific hygiene rules is the chapter on hunting. The debate on this in Parliament was very lively. We have now presented a proposal that the Commission also finds acceptable. We must of course accept that there are national peculiarities regarding the development of hunting traditions, and these have now been included in the proposals, so that we can work on the assumption that we can still guarantee game meat to be safe in health terms. This means in particular that existing traditions should be maintained. I believe that with these proposals, and with the proposed regulation on animal-health rules governing the production, placing on the market and importation of products of animal origin, we have created an important basis for improving rules governing foodstuffs. I specially want to thank Mr Kindermann for having produced such an excellent report. The provisions regarding the importation of foodstuffs are so well presented in his report that I do not need to explain any further. I consider that the regulations before us provide a good basis for extending the Regulation on official controls of foodstuffs. I am very anxious to see that because we want to deal with it as quickly as possible.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, which is just as we expected. I think that this regulation and this legal basis will, with the measures that follow, help to improve food safety in the European Union, and will establish the general principles of the new food law. With reference to general food law, I would like to mention, in particular, that this represents a real success in developing the principle of a seamless improvement in the food chain from farmer to consumer. A key aspect of the principles set out here remains the traceability of products. I believe that we have accordingly established two significant new principles and requirements for improving food safety. The centrepiece of the regulation is the creation of the European Food Authority, or, as it is designated in the amendment, the ‘European Food Safety Authority’. I do not want to spend too much time on definitions here. What I consider most important is the fact that the framework conditions have been created for this Authority. The first of these is adequate financial provision. It seems to me that this has not so far been achieved to the extent we might have wished, and the same applies to conditions governing communication between the Authority and the various authorities in the Member States. Appropriate arrangements have not yet been set up in the Member States, and there is still a lot to be done in this regard. As for the openness of the authority, I believe that this House's amendment is certainly correct, but we also have to guarantee that in certain circumstances the Authority can also meet behind closed doors. An important issue, as many others have already said, is the location of the Authority, and if the Council rejects our proposals, it seems to me that it must intend to locate the Authority in such a way that our requirements and conditions cannot be met. We cannot let such a situation prevail, nor can we accept it. The Council must finally give in on this and select a location that will facilitate communication with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the European Union recreational craft are used mainly for leisure activities and I do not think this will change in the next few years. This leisure activity has become extremely popular over recent years. There are now over 3.5 million motor boats in the European Union and the number is rising. If you include sailing boats and rowing boats, there is one boat for every 70 citizens. The use of recreational craft – and here I must disagree somewhat with our rapporteur – is not totally without its problems. Certainly, exhaust emissions compared with overall exhaust emissions from other engines in the European Union are tiny. We have brought about a great many improvements with cars and lorries over recent years and we should seek to achieve fundamental improvements in the recreational craft sector. More importantly, people living on the banks of highly frequented inland waters live with the impression that the noise from motor boats is a constant source of disturbance, even at quiet times. The point here, I think, is that we need to reduce the level of noise generated by these recreational craft. People trying to relax at the weekend and local residents in particular sometimes have to put up with a great deal of disturbance, precisely because of the increase in the number of recreational craft. Nor must we underestimate the noise generated when the water is displaced by boats travelling at high speed. Implementing the directive will reduce noise and exhaust emission levels. I too think that the derogations proposed in committee are right. More importantly, I think the derogations for historic craft and self-build craft are justified. Building these craft often takes a long time and is a leisure activity in itself. We need to retain this. However, as I have already mentioned, recreational craft are used in areas in which there are large numbers of people trying to relax, which is why it is especially important to keep on reducing noise pollution and why I think it would be wrong to allow any further derogations. However, I think it is right that, even with the need for harmonisation, Member States should still be able to issue stricter requirements for inland waters used for drinking water supplies. This has nothing to do with making inland waters off limits; it is a move towards reducing costs.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, hats off to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteur! They have worked unstintingly and single-mindedly to present this marvellous document. I believe that, with this report, we have fired the starting signal for the enhancement of food safety in the European Union. As the rapporteur for the specific hygiene provisions, I could only proceed on the basis of clear and firm views, one of which is reflected in the fact that Parliament has never questioned the use of a regulation as the legal instrument. I lay particular emphasis on this, because there are different perceptions within the Council. That is why I wish to re-emphasise that a regulation is the only legal instrument for this and the other five sets of provisions. Nothing else would be acceptable to us. Regulations naturally require extensive amendments to national food legislation, but that, I believe, is the only way to remove inconsistencies and close loopholes. The approach taken in the draft regulation, whereby food producers are to be made more responsible for the safety and quality of their products, is certainly right and proper, but to the same extent more onerous verification duties must be imposed on governments too. This applies not only to the scope and frequency of inspections but also to their quality. The professional competence and background knowledge of inspectors must be improved. This is no job for auxiliary staff, and recent cutbacks in this domain must be reversed. As for the Food Authority itself, I must stress the importance of a clear definition of its responsibilities. Food safety must be its main concern, and its role must be confined to risk analysis. For this reason we should not include in this regulation extraneous issues such as quality, nutritional value and so on. The seat of the authority has frequently been discussed. Parliament, whether or not it has codecision rights in this matter, has laid down clear criteria that should be applied, and let me say that we must not allow another dilemma to arise like the one in Dublin, a situation in which an authority cannot operate because the basic conditions are not right.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission are holding this debate today. In my view, some progress has already been made in the past. After all, we have been discussing this issue for a long time, and have addressed problems of animal husbandry, animal breeding and animal welfare on numerous occasions. If we examine the process regarding the cage-rearing of hens, for example, we – Parliament and the European Union – have already made significant progress. If I look at consumer behaviour following the debates in recent years, I can already see a change. Nonetheless, I would caution against taking the Commissioner's statement – that 85% of consumers are prepared to pay more for food produced in accordance with the highest standards of animal welfare – at face value. This figure is wrong. If I asked any member of the public: 'Would you be prepared to pay more for animal welfare?', naturally he is going to say: 'Of course I would!' However, when he is at the counter buying his steak, he has a rather different view. Then it is quality and price that count, and nothing else matters. Nonetheless, we must try to reconcile the status of animals as a means of production – we have to accept this, it is a fact – and animal welfare concerns. There is no point in lashing out at the food producers and blaming them for everything. The only way forward is to do what the Council has suggested – I think this is very important – namely to concentrate on raising public awareness and fostering sensitivity to animal welfare issues. This is a very important point. This brings us to issues of education and training within the family. In other words, a very wide sphere of activity must be included. As regards animal health – an issue which has also been raised today – I am a little doubtful. A healthy animal is not always one which has been reared correctly in optimal animal welfare conditions. Animals can be healthy even without these conditions, as we know from practical experience. I wish this House every success in the next few days, also in debating the new directive on the agenda. I hope that this will take us a further step towards better animal welfare in Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today has again proved that the European Union’s environmental policy has in recent years become a key aspect of European policy. There can be no doubt that the wide-ranging efforts to protect the environment and human health and the careful and rational use of natural resources are necessary and important. The compromise now arrived at in the Conciliation Committee concerning the assessment of the environmental impact of certain Parliamentary programmes is therefore also an important building block in the European Union’s environmental policy. I am glad that many of the uncertainties and imponderables from the first and second readings are no longer part of this directive. I particularly welcome the fact that many terms – and I will only mention the term public again here – are now clearly defined. The extension of the directive to support out of EU funds, that is to support from the Structural Funds, must certainly be viewed positively by and large. It should be pointed out here, however, that applications for money from the Structural Funds are already being delayed by bureaucratic hurdles and by what seem to me in some cases to be highly unreasonable demands. If we are now looking for further conditions to be met for support from the Structural Funds, the necessary second step must be to reduce bureaucracy in other fields. I would emphatically point out that the impression should not be given here that inclusion of the environmental impact assessment will put support in jeopardy. Allow me to draw your attention to another weakness. It is doubtful whether the environmental impact assessment referred to in the present text will be applied in a comparable manner in all Member States. Too often the application and implementation of important rules is left to the discretion of the Member States. This no doubt satisfies the regionalists in the EU, but it is hardly conducive to achieving comparable situations in the European Union. There is also the fear that distortions of competition might result. I see this as the crucial weakness of the compromise arrived at in the Conciliation Committee. If environmental impact assessments serve only to highlight possible dangers in one country but the same results of the assessment may result in the measures in question being banned in another, we can hardly speak of the arrangement as being appropriate for an internal market. We should watch and critically examine developments in the next few years and take action accordingly.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome the tabling of a Green Paper on PVC, but I have to say straight away that this Green Paper disappointed me, because it opens the door to panic, not to panic about jobs, but panic about PVC as a material. This has been quite perceptible here today. I should like to say to Mr Sacconi that he has tried to put a few things straight and he has succeeded in doing so in parts, but not everywhere. I think that we have a great deal more to do here. We must, I believe, take note of one thing: if we are discussing how to phase out or replace PVC then we are on the wrong track. PVC is a material which we encounter every day, which we need and can use in many areas of our lives. In my opinion this is also how it will stay in the near future. The fact that this requires us to solve problems is something that is also true in any other sector and with any other material. The weak points of the Green Paper are that it mentions products, such as cadmium and lead, which industry actually uses only very rarely in the PVC production process even now. I have seen for myself how the measures under the voluntary commitments are being introduced in companies. I, myself, am no friend of self-regulation; I have always campaigned hard against it. After all, we need laws to achieve something. In this case, however, it was not the lobbying trap to which someone at the front referred a few minutes ago: I satisfied myself of its effectiveness. We should appropriate industry's findings and not randomly back or call for substitutes which we ourselves have not yet investigated, and about which we ourselves do not know the full facts. These are points, therefore, which certainly need to be taken into consideration, and the Green Paper needs to be altered to reflect them. Where legislation is concerned we always say that we need to make progress quickly and that we need to know what's what. The entire body of legislation on the use of PVC – the incineration directive, the landfill directive – provides legislative foundations on which we can build when we want to use and dispose of this particular material.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission for the information which it has given us on the fight against BSE and to tell Commissioner Byrne that my impression is that he has the situation in hand and that his proposals are clear and decisive. I think this is what we need because, apart from BSE, we also have hysteria and panic to deal with in several areas. This initial information which we have been given is without doubt most comprehensive. But I must say, Commissioner, that I would have liked to have seen the information on the countries which you so nicely listed compared with the results of controls carried out by food and veterinary health inspectors. I must say, in all honesty, that I only have to think of the ignorance and squirming with which the Agriculture Council has reacted to proposals over recent months, including Parliament's proposals, to lose all confidence in information provided by Member States and ministers. Of course, there is always some cause for objection with most measures. But we all know that the measures being decided now are the result of a failure to act, including over recent years, and we cannot afford to lower our sights. A few speakers have already referred to tests. The point is: if we do not test all animals, then the results are meaningless. I have heard that the abattoirs are simply refusing to slaughter animals. What is being done? They are being clubbed without being tested. That is just not on. We must intervene here, we must sort this out throughout Europe. Mrs Roth-Behrendt said we need more and better controls and indeed we do. But we also need clear-cut, comprehensible laws in Europe. We shall be dealing with hygiene regulations shortly. I say to you, in all honesty that, from what I hear from the Member States at the moment, I have no cause for optimism whatsoever. We are back on the same old merry-go-round, it is just not on. We need to stand together and give Europe clear-cut laws. That is the only way to get a grip on the problem.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to find this topic on the agenda today. I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for raising the question. Although you refer to three specific EU directives, I would point out that what we are talking about here is a widespread problem with the transposition of EU legislation in the Member States. If you start from the principle that directives and regulations are adopted by the Council and Parliament in the EU, then it is quite reasonable to assume that the Council – which does, after all, use these directives – will transpose them in the Member States accordingly. But what do we see happening? Two camps are forming. On one side there is the European Union, which seeks to blame the Member States for shortcomings. On the other side, there are the Member States, which are more than willing to offload their problems onto the oh-so-distant Europe, forgetting in the process that they are part of Europe themselves, and the Commission is piggy-in-the-middle. Commissioner, you have gone to great lengths to try and ensure that these laws are transposed in the European Union in a purposeful manner. But it really is not that simple and, of course, we have criticised your methods sometimes. I can understand to an extent, why you took the line you did. There are various reasons as to why countries have trouble transposing this legislation. In my opinion, one of the reasons in the case of the nitrates directive is the failure to observe scientific findings, because one thing is for sure, it is not possible to reduce nitrate levels as rapidly as we demand. Nature simply will not allow it. However, in the case of the habitats directive, Parliament highlighted the shortcomings quite clearly last year, namely that the directive was complicated and unclear in parts and so it cannot be transposed in the Member States. When we were in Toulouse, we saw how local people are trying to transpose it. But basically, they do not know what is going on. They do not know where the boundaries are, or how to apply them properly. These are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority. But it is also our 
responsibility to ensure that the directives are less utopian and far more realistic in nature. Mrs Jackson's question actually contains all the points we need to address and there is nothing more to add to it. Speedier sanctions and careful drafting of laws will enable us to solve this problem. However, I would just like to point out that something needs to change in the Member States too, because the Environment Ministers are, no doubt, sometimes too cowardly to promote the initiatives they adopt here, in their own countries, if this could lead to conflict.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been a directive on general product safety since 1992. The purpose of the present debate is to review the experience we have gained with the existing directive, to incorporate that experience and to eliminate any shortcomings. I rather doubt whether we have adequately achieved that. There are certainly complex legal issues here. The scope of the directive in relation to the wide variety of national and Community product legislation needs to be defined, as that legislation, too, covers the same safety ground. We need to ensure seamless consumer protection but without regulating the same things more than once or even in contradictory ways. The possibility of having a product's compliance with regulations certified by an external agency would certainly be very helpful in this case and would ensure a clearer and more logical approach. However, it would have been better to have an EU regulation providing for a general European system and eliminating the simultaneous existence of national regulations in Europe. In the food sector, for example, there are also numerous rules and regulations which are currently being amended and revised as a result of proposed EU regulations and I think this will help us to reach a high standard of safety. In other sectors, this directive has been extended to other fields of application. The inclusion of service-related products will lead to dealers and the craft sector increasingly being burdened with obligations which are actually the responsibility of the manufacturer. Elsewhere, we are calling on the Commission to present a proposal on the safety of services, so it is not evident why we should or would want to regulate service aspects here and now, instead of waiting for the Commission's proposal, since it is becoming increasingly clear that problems with demarcation between different provisions will arise and that legal uncertainty will grow as time goes on. Just a few more words about export issues. On the one hand we are demanding widely varying safety standards and like Mr Blokland are calling for national and regional needs to be taken into account, and on the other we want to impose our national provisions on countries we export to. I feel that this means there is a fundamental contradiction in the directive's approach, which we cannot support as it is proposed here.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we began our work on BSE in the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE, the very first thing we had to do was to expose and overcome cover-ups, secretiveness and deceit, and to take measures which, overall, have been very successful and offer a way forward in solving the problem of BSE. We have already heard many times today that the real problem facing us is to implement the decisions we have already taken. Mr Byrne, I am extremely grateful that so far you have made excellent progress in putting into practice the undertaking that you gave when you were appointed. You have brought forward proposals such as the White Paper and the hygiene regulations, and I can assure you that Parliament will deal swiftly with those hygiene regulations. We will work quickly enough for them to be effectively implemented in the new few years. But I am not aware of anything happening at Council level here. There are only declarations and opinions, but no decisions as regards directives or regulations. What I find incredible is this tug of war in the Council over meat exports and imports. This seems to be all about emotions. The public's feelings have really been whipped up, with the sole aim of securing the market for each country's own beef. Nothing else has happened! Now emotions are being stirred up again with dramatic announcements about banning animal meal as feed for all animals. If you would only implement what we agreed, then you would not need to worry about all this any more. It reminds me of witch-hunts in the Middle Ages. We are pursuing "sinners" who are not guilty at all. The causes are to be found somewhere else altogether. I would like to suggest rapid introduction of these tests that you too are proposing, Commissioner, and not as spot checks, but for every animal slaughtered, without any age restrictions. Only then can we say to the public "This meat has been tested and you can eat it". There really is no better solution. I have worked out the cost – 10 cents per kilo. So we do not need to argue here about millions of euros – every member of the public will happily pay this, I am quite sure of that!

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to say in the clearest terms that the White Paper on food safety before us today provides a springboard for action by the institutions of the European Union, for achieving the highest standards in food safety and for regaining consumer confidence. After all, there are good reasons why we asked for this paper. Of course, there have been very different approaches, as the discussions in recent months have demonstrated. That is why the rapporteur deserves great praise, because he has managed to pull together very different approaches and ideas into a clear report. There have even been widely conflicting views about the main point of the White Paper, the creation of a Food Safety Agency. I will not deny that when the White Paper was published, I spoke out against the Agency. If when it comes to the vote I – and I expect a substantial majority – argue in favour of this Agency, I would nevertheless advise the Commissioner not to be deceived. There are many doubts and critical voices. You should take Parliament's proposals seriously and concentrate the Agency's work on scientific tasks and risk analysis. I particularly wish to stress that the Agency and the present system of advisory committees cannot exist side by side. There must be clear arrangements governing the Agency's cooperation with the Joint Research Centre in Ispra and the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin. You must prevent several institutions carrying out similar work in parallel. As regards the actual structure of the Agency, it must be clear how it is to be financed. We in Parliament welcome and wish to encourage a financing plan. What staff numbers are required? What is an appropriate timetable for setting up an authority of this kind? You should also use the White Paper to enforce strict rules in the Member States. If the proposals for over 80 legislative measures are much the same as the hygiene rules I have now received as rapporteur, then I am very optimistic. However, Commissioner, when it comes to the provisions on labelling, please think again about your ideas … (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beef labelling was actually conceived as a quick way of regaining the public’s confidence in beef after a string of crises and scandals. But it has since turned into an almost unending saga. Whenever the regulation might cease to apply, Parliament is called upon to act quickly to prevent a legal vacuum arising. There have been two deadlines, first December 1999 and now the present deadline of 31 August 2000. Commissioner, given the time periods involved, you cannot seriously call on Parliament not to adopt any amendments. We want a workable system, and we have always said that. As the proposal before us does not guarantee that, it is not just our right, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to adopt amendments. When I then hear that in Italy, for example, the technical requirements for this system are not even in place yet, and that the same applies in other countries, then I wonder why there is all this rush if the system has not been implemented anyway. I would welcome some comments from the Commissioner on that point. The Commission’s proposal will lead to our having to deal with the system again before long. The Commission perhaps reacted somewhat hastily in the wake of the BSE crisis, and now we are into brinkmanship again. I cannot help feeling that the 2003 deadline that was thought up in December 1998 is now occupying the Commission’s thought processes again. I believe that you can achieve implementation of this regulation by 1 September if you accept our amendments. You will not achieve it if you still insist on including category of animal, which we have already touched upon several times today. That has nothing to do with information for the public, it is just a quality issue, and does not belong in this regulation. Commissioner, please accept the amendments and we will then have something workable in place by 1 September.

Mr President, our experience of the Community eco-audit scheme has been very mixed. In Germany and Austria a great number of businesses have taken part in it, whereas the uptake from businesses in other Member States has been very low. The aim of the present revision must therefore be to make the eco-audit scheme more attractive. For that reason it is important that there should be scope to involve companies from the service sector and to support small and medium-sized enterprises. All that, however, is not enough, in my view. More needs to be done, particularly in terms of reducing the administrative burden and establishing ways of projecting the public profile of the service.  From discussions at various company headquarters it has emerged that EMAS has an internal impact and that workforces are playing a far greater part in protecting the environment, but the time has now come to improve the external impact of the system. In all the reflections on how to improve EMAS, one thing has to be remembered, namely that EMAS is a voluntary system which companies can join. It must not therefore be encumbered with concepts such as best available technology. These are binding specifications which set excessively difficult targets. All we shall achieve by adopting them is to make businesses quit the system. That surely serves no purpose at all. The system has proved useful so far, and we should build on the valuable experience that has been amassed. If we cherish certain environmental ideals, I am certainly willing to pursue them too, but that will take us down the road of directives and regulations. We cannot realise such ideals by opting for a voluntary system like EMAS. One last point that seems important to me if the eco-audit is to be a practicable mechanism is the frequency of its validation. The proposal envisages renewal of the validation at yearly intervals. That, to my mind, is far too frequent. Companies have to spend nine months on the preparation of an environmental report. They cannot do that if annual validation is required. I therefore propose an interval of two to three years, and I hope you will support this proposal.

Mr President, for many years now we have constantly been receiving new reports describing the depletion of the vital ozone layer. At first, the hole in the ozone layer started getting bigger over the southern hemisphere, i.e. a long way away, and for some time now we have had to face the fact that the ozone layer is also changing over Europe.   Since 1976, the ozone layer over Europe has been contracting continuously, and is now depleted by 15%. The Commission only informed us about this recently and warned against a rise in skin cancer ailments, allergies and eye disease. People knew as early as the eighties which substances led to depletion of the ozone layer and continue to do so. According to estimates, for every one per cent less of ozone, the earth is exposed to 2% more UV, which means that people are at greater risk of contracting skin cancer. I am therefore delighted that a decision has at last been reached on such an urgent matter, which we will use to transpose the Montreal Protocol at Community level and to go even further in some respects than the demands that were raised there. Although I endorse the outcome of the conciliation procedure, I make no bones about the fact that I am not satisfied.   I am referring to the issues that have been controversial to the last, concerning the ban on partially halogenated hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which are mainly used in refrigeration and air conditioning plants. If we are going to opt for a ban on the use of these substances on the basis of definite findings pointing to the damaging effect they have on the ozone layer, then I would have hoped for a more consistent approach on the part of the Council as regards transitional periods and exemptions, particularly as ecofriendly alternative substances are available for all types of application. I would remind you that the ban on using virgin HCFCs in refrigeration and air conditioning plants will not take effect until the year 2010, whereas the European Parliament had called for it to be 2005. And in the case of recycled HCFCs, the full ban will not take effect until 2015, rather than 2007, which is what the European Parliament wanted. But cleverly, a transitional clause was incorporated which allows for a modification of the phase-out date of recycled HCFCs. I believe that reports on further damage to the ozone layer and also new scientific findings as regards alternative substances will soon show the present compromise up as having fallen too short. Time will tell, and if my prognosis is right then the European Parliament will soon be raising the issue of the phase-out dates for partially halogenated HCFCs again, and will be in a position to deal with this matter in the interests of the environment and public health.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, generally speaking, chocolate is credited with producing pleasurable moments and helping to create peace and goodwill amongst men. The chocolate directive is proving very much the exception within Parliament and the European Union, for it is a controversial issue and has unleashed emotions that have been seen nowhere more clearly than in today’s debate. Mr Maaten spoke of agony: yes, it certainly has been, and it is time we put a stop to it.   Yet the matter is actually quite simple. We always talk in terms of what might happen. There are two chocolate markets in the single European internal market. To reinforce the point again: there is already chocolate containing the disputed 5% of other vegetable fats, and there are countries where it is prohibited to add these fats, with the exception of cocoa butter. There is legal uncertainty and a lack of clarity within this market, from the point of view of the market operator as well as that of the consumer. This must be tackled. This situation cannot be allowed to continue, Mr Lannoye, whether it is in the interests of the multinationals or not. I have spoken to medium-sized enterprises. They would be happy if this directive was at long last to come into force.  Turning to Parliament’s demands: Parliament has called for labelling, with the label being separate from the list of ingredients. We have been calling for this for a long time now. Parliament has said we need a method of verification. ISPRA has demonstrated that a method of verification is already in place. After all, we test eco-apples at the location where they are produced, and not at the market. The same could apply to chocolate as I see it.  Of course, the question as to what effect this will have on the developing countries always looms large in this debate. There is an open letter that expresses the thought that the chocolate directive is the last nail in the coffin of 11 million people in western Africa. I think it is extremely irresponsible to distort the facts and inject an emotional note into the debate in this way. After all, it is quite clear: we called for this list because it comes from the developing countries. It is easy to see that developing countries still stand to benefit.   I am pleased that the common position has achieved a majority. Let us give consumers the choice and create greater diversity through unity within the internal market for chocolate – whilst preserving legal certainty – by rejecting the proposed amendments and endorsing the common position.

 Mr President, as you just said, this is the second reading for the directive on the awarding of the eco-label. The European eco-label is, it has to be said, a product of the internal market. Its function, partly in response to the increasing flow of products across borders, is to label products and services which have a high level of environmental compatibility. Its function, on the one hand, is to provide information to consumers from one country to the next and, on the other, to increase awareness within industry and among citizens to recognise and promote environmental issues. And this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip. I am of the opinion that the meaningfulness of a European label which is tailored to the European internal market is beyond dispute. However, it is often a long road from the conception of a good idea to its practical implementation. This is precisely the case with the eco-label whose main claim to fame at present is, unfortunately, its virtual anonymity in most States. I think that only a very small minority of citizens have ever actually seen it and for this reason my report has paid greatest attention to the wholly inadequate preparations for the label. What are the weaknesses in the current eco-label regulation which have given rise to today’s unsatisfactory situation? I think that a key problem lies in the cost structure of the label. The test procedures which companies and their products must go through in order to obtain the label are long and costly. We are therefore advocating that the stipulation of testing requirements should look to keep test costs to an absolute minimum, although this must obviously not be misinterpreted as a qualitative watering down of testing requirements. As well as the cost of test procedures, the on-going fees which must be paid to the European eco-label system are also highly significant. Here, too, we envisage a reduction in costs for SMEs, firms in developing countries and enterprises involved in other aspects of European or international environmental legislation. In this regard, I should cite, for example, EMAS and ISO 14001. In addition to a reduction in costs for certain enterprises, the report also envisages a maximum fee. In this we are following the example of almost all the national labelling systems, which also have this ceiling. The purpose of this approach is to make the labelling system equally attractive to large consumer goods manufacturers and service providers. Let me make something perfectly clear at this point: this is not a present to the large multinationals, as is being mooted in some quarters, but an important step towards the label exerting a wide influence in the long term. We must also clearly understand that without a certain amount of financial impetus for the European label we will not make any headway. In my opinion, we should take on the responsibility for this financing. Another important point in this second reading is the regulation of the relationship between the national eco-label and the European equivalent. At first reading we were still advocating the gradual abolition of national labels in favour of the European eco-label; it is not without good reason that we have abandoned this position. In some States national labels are well established and enjoy public recognition. This is the case, for example, as regards the Nordic Swan in Scandinavia and the Blue Angel in Germany. In my estimation it would be nonsensical and contrary to the spirit of subsidiarity to abolish these proven labels in favour of an as yet unestablished European label. Our approach should be different. We must ensure that the co-existence of national and European labels is coordinated and in this regard the working plan provided for in the common position, which we have supplemented in various respects, but which I think will meet with approval, is extremely important. The eco-label regulation treads the fine line between economic and ecological interests, one group wanting above all to enforce stringent environmental requirements, the other with an eye on the marketing aspect of the label. Both groups, however, have one thing in common: they want the eco-label to succeed. I believe that the regulation which we are considering today has found a solid compromise between the interests of all the groups involved and I am convinced that the constructive proposals of our House will also be acceptable to the Council and make for a highly successful European eco-label.

Mr President, the FFH directive is an issue which has concerned us for some time now and we are currently experiencing a few teething problems. However, to begin let me say the following: the FFH directive is an important directive and creates a new climate in Europe for the protection of nature, the environment and birds. I would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this. I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented. All the same, in the case of the FFH directive the question arises as to whether the legislation which we have adopted is actually implementable and I can see obvious weak points. As I see it, the FFH directive is an instance where the legislation is not matched to the feasibilities of the regions. I see a problem in the various legal interpretations in the Member States due to the partially unclear definitions in the EU legislation, whilst, on the other hand, there is a lack of strong subsidiary aspects and approaches. Revision of the FFH directive, including the current difficulties in implementation, should not, I think be excluded. Alongside this general criticism of the FFH directive, however, I also see a particular problem with the amalgamation of the EU environmental and structural policies. Article 12 of the structural funds regulation adopted on 21 June 1999 provides for the possibility of sanctions in the event of violations in the following areas: implementation of environmental legislation, breaches of public contracts and failure to observe equality between men and women. To date, the Commission has only threatened sanctions in the case of the FFH directive. Does it also intend to initiate sanction mechanisms in the other areas? In my opinion, this is a very problematic course of action. The EU has a quite different means of enforcing sanctions, i.e. the European Court of Justice. The possible cutting or withholding of money from the Structural Fund is a form of sanction whose effect on the regions concerned cannot just be disregarded. What will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen, above all, in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the Structural Fund? What sanctions will the Commission then impose for non-implementation of EU environment law? That the Commission is also totally unsure is shown by the fact that it initially wanted to include the entire state in the sanctions, then only a region, as you pointed out to Environment Minister Trittin, Commissioner. I would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here.

The regulation to be amended at the Commission’s proposal was described two years ago in the wake of the BSE crisis as a central issue and an important decision within the context of European consumer protection. The stated purpose of the regulation is to protect animal and human health and to increase or restore consumer confidence in the quality of beef and meat products. What was it that persuaded the Council to adopt this regulation when it did? Was it perhaps a way of saying to the public, look here, we are doing all we can to end the BSE crisis, while never really having any serious intention, either then or now, of implementing the regulation. Unfortunately, it was just that. The public has been cheated and, on top of everything, a disservice has been done to European consumer protection. To be sure, some speakers voiced their concern during the first and second readings that the text of the law was perhaps too strict and that there would be problems with its transposition. So there were signs. If that was the problem, we had the chance to rectify it but, unfortunately, we did not make use of that chance. The errors on the part of individual Member States, and I would be most interested to know which Member States, is only one side of the coin; the irresponsible conduct on the part of the Commission is the other. Allow me in this context to remind the Commission of a few agreed dates: the Commission should be managing an electronic data base on 31 December 1999, i.e. in 16 days’ time. Is this data base up and running? The same question arises in relation to the Member States’ reports on the implementation of the beef labelling system; these reports were supposed to have been sent to the Commission by 1 May 1999. Are they available? Obviously the delay with all the stages of transposition has not come about overnight. The Commission must have been able to see at the beginning of the year that the deadlines set could not be kept. Why then was Parliament not informed of these developments earlier, as it could have been in July. Today we are discussing postponing the entry into force of the regulation without
 really knowing how transposition is progressing in the individual Member States, without knowing how long implementation will still take and, more importantly, what action has yet to be taken. The original intention of the regulation, which was to generate confidence in European consumer protection, would be reversed by this sort of measure. The Commission’s present proposal is, in my eyes, confusing and lacking in background information and I am therefore unable to support it.

 Mr President, as I see it, the report before us today on reducing exhaust emissions from heavy goods vehicles serves to carry forward our efforts to improve air quality in Europe whilst preserving our citizens’ mobility. No one has said so yet, but that is guaranteed too. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work. The report largely addresses the critical issues and fits in well with existing clean air legislation. At this point I would like to make a general comment about the formal structure of the report. I wonder if the technical criteria set out in the annex really are a matter for us to discuss as Members of Parliament. Without expert guidance, the annexes are simply impenetrable for most of us – that has been my experience at least. I think perhaps that in future, with technical reports like this, the Legal Service should bring them into line with what we have already proposed and agreed upon. I would also like to comment on the most difficult and controversial points of this second reading, in terms of content. I agree with the rapporteur that the transition to new standards should be done in a single stage. By setting the deadline for 2006, we are demonstrating to the Council that we are willing to compromise, as we too will be making a concession as compared with the first reading. I consider that the Council proposal, which does not provide for this to be introduced until 2008, is not acceptable here. The directive on improving fuel quality and the catalytic converter technology now available make it possible for the Council and Parliament to come up with a truly ambitious project, without burdening industry and the transport sector with charges. Let me remind you of our experience with the Auto-Oil programme for cars. We stuck to our guns then, and it has now turned out that we took the right approach. Another important point, as I see it, is to encourage re-equipping of older vehicles by means of fiscal and other incentives. I think there is enormous potential here. Heavy goods vehicles have a very long service life. We should most definitely look at the fiscal options, even if the conversion only meets one criterion. This is an area where a lot more can be achieved. By and large, I am very pleased... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for about two years now, ever since the Kyoto conference, we have been discussing how our commitments to cut CO2 emissions can be transposed 

into European law. Consumer information and awareness-raising are the third pillar of our strategy, alongside the environmental 

agreement with car manufacturers and tax measures. I believe that the common position submitted to us by the Council fully addresses this third requirement. It is well balanced and takes account of the main requests made by the European Parliament at first reading – let me say that again, the main points. Because we should be really grateful to the Council, and I am not just saying this to get a laugh, that so many of Parliament’s requests from first reading have been weeded out, given that they were adopted in a fit of over-zealousness and did not have my approval. Mr Lange, I hope you will not take offence if I say that this request regarding petrol and fuel consumption in independent vehicle heaters and air-conditioning units is one of these. If we start trying to limit that certain level of luxury, that element of quality that people have become accustomed to, we will just irritate consumers. We should not be deterred by this. That is why I am happy that this directive is now somewhat clearer and that requests like this have been taken out. I think that we should limit our legislative texts to essential and comprehensible points, and that also applies to this directive. 
This is all the more relevant given that in future we will increasingly have to deal with complex and technical subjects. In Strasbourg we have plans for a similar directive on just such technical processes.  The directive we are discussing is certainly an important part of our strategy for combating CO2 emissions. However, I think that a certain scepticism about its effectiveness is not out of place. I have my doubts about whether publishing consumption and exhaust gas figures will really influence consumers in their purchasing decisions. Consumption figures are important anyway at a time of rising petrol prices. In order words, customers will inform themselves out of pure self-interest. I also believe that mentioning CO2 emissions has more to do with awareness-raising. For me, that is also one of the key points of this directive: raising consumers’ awareness of the problem, so that they worry a little more about reducing CO2 emissions when it comes to their favourite toy, their car, and so that this becomes part of their way of thinking. Because if we are really to achieve Kyoto’s ambitious targets, then we all need to get involved, not just governments! So what am I driving at here? As the legislature of the European Union, we will in future continue to have no option but to set clear limit values and time limits for achieving significant reductions in emissions. Some Member States have limited ambitions in this respect. I believe, Commissioner, that we still have some persuading to do together. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on this report. I am very grateful to him for that and he has our support. I do not think there are any more problems!

Schmitt (PPE-DE

rapporteur. – (DE)
 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for me the report before us today and this agenda item are among the most difficult of the past legislative period. Not because the report is so wide ranging, but because the procedure has proved to be extremely difficult. Since the Kingdom of Spain’s initiative to oblige carriers to communicate passenger data was presented, that is since the first document appeared early last year, every month has brought unofficial new versions with the promise of another official one shortly. That dragged on really until the start of this year and since we are coming to the end of this legislative period, I presented a report at the beginning of February, based on the old proposal. Then in the middle of February, the Council suddenly produced a new document as a result of which I then had to prepare a completely new report. To the point in hand, my group agrees with the starting point of saying that it may make sense to oblige carriers to communicate data on persons entering the EU from third countries to the competent border control authorities in advance. As presented, however, what the Council has produced is technically far from convincing. It is true that the Council went on to correct itself in many respects. Originally, for example, it wanted airlines to be obliged to report to the authorities anyone who failed to use their return ticket within 48 hours of the planned date. That means that any of us could be suspected of staying somewhere we were not entitled simply because we had not used our ticket, at least not at the planned time. On some points the Council has recognised that it is on the wrong track, but in my opinion it has still not provided the necessary tool. To this day, for example, there has been no dialogue with the carriers concerned as to how this might actually be done technically, what it will cost and who in the end will pay for it. I can only point out that if we want to prevent illegal immigration, we are dealing mainly with third countries that are not exactly wealthy. Think about those third countries, we also know that checking in there is in many cases still done manually, the boarding card is not printed out by computer, but you are given a pre-printed card and the seat number is stuck on to it. In those cases, airlines would be involved in considerable expense. I think that if we have such expectations we must first seek a dialogue with the carriers about how that might be jointly organised. Secondly, it does not explain at all convincingly whether the border control authorities will really be able to do anything useful with the data provided. In other words, will it make controls easier and more effective? This question has not been examined at all, either in committee meetings or in the document. Moreover, this document contains no justification at all, the Council initiative is unreasoned, there is neither a general justification nor a detailed justification for the individual articles. One very central point for which I have still not been given a satisfactory explanation is the question of whether the data collected really will make for more effective controls in the country of entry. That is why my report and the initiative having been rejected in committee, my group will be abstaining in the vote tomorrow, because our position is that basically we find the idea interesting and it may be expedient, but the technical side of it must be cleanly worked. So far, this Council initiative has not done that, and that is why I do not believe we should continue any further down this path. It is my sincere wish that we should take a final vote on this initiative tomorrow and not refer it back to committee. Tomorrow, at any rate, I shall not be proposing that we do this. I believe the road we should take together is that the Commission should submit a sound proposal based on the original Council document (it has already suggested as much itself in a committee meeting) and that we should then have an informed discussion and find a sensible solution.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it really does matter a great deal to me that I should start by thanking both the rapporteurs, Mr Fava and also Mrs Sanders-ten Holte. I think they have fought splendidly and with commitment, particularly in the final stage, when one sometimes got the impression that only Parliament was left to carry on the fight on this issue, the Commission having thrown in the towel a while back. According to the splendid brochure that was issued in 2002 with a foreword by the Commissioner, ‘the time is ripe’. Then along came the many proposals that, alas, never seem quite to have taken legal effect. It is for that reason that I am a bit wary today of talking in terms of a historic moment or of a culmination. This is at best a start. Let us have no illusions; this is the third time that this House has discussed this topic, and if the public could listen in, they would find it utterly beyond belief, believing as they do that this ought to have been sorted out ages ago. On the ground, we have no borders any more; I can get in the car and drive from Berlin to Paris or from Paris to Rome without undergoing checks. Despite the compelling arguments in favour of its doing so, this situation does not, however, apply in the skies above us, where aircraft fly over borders on a day-to day basis. What is so comic about all this is the lamentable fact that the Council, in March 2002, when it met in Barcelona, came out with an explicit statement, noted a need, and made a demand to the effect that ‘we need a single European sky’, and it was the Council that stonewalled wherever it could, right up to the very end. I put this in such blunt terms simply because I have for a long time been considering whether I can at all vote in favour of the conciliation procedure. As we saw it, there were two central points, the two big issues. We wanted greater safety, and we wanted more efficiency in the air. We were aware that the two were closely interconnected, and that, on the one hand, collaboration and cooperation between civil and military aviation had to be organised, whilst, on the other, we must put an end to fragmentation once and for all. As the brochure so splendidly put it, the patchwork had to become a network. As Mr Fava put it, the fact that there are 41 air traffic control centres in the Member States alone, with a short flight from Brussels to Rome having to pass through seven of them, not only makes for potential dangers, but also provides reasons for unnecessary delays. The Council has spent a long time blocking these central points. I regret having to tell you, Commissioner, that, when the Common Position came back to the committee, it was your representatives who said that the Council may well have taken a conservative position, but that was the only big success we were going to get. If Parliament had not stood so firm, and if the two rapporteurs had not given their all, it would not have been possible to achieve what is at least a beginning, with some degree of cooperation, an agreement, an understanding, a shared conversation between all the users. Nor, moreover, would there have been the clear instruction to the Member States – who, let us recall, have had decades in which to create functional airspace blocks – combined with the declaration, which I saw as crucial, that if nothing changes in the next five years, we must and will make improvements, in which event we cannot allow the Member States to retain competence in this matter. With this in mind – for this was what I saw as essential – I said it would be better to have a bird in the hand at the moment and to make a start, for there was nothing else on offer. Let me make it quite clear, though, that I have not lost sight of the two birds in the bush, and I would ask that all of us in this European Parliament should continue to keep on working hard so that this single airspace in Europe should not be merely a vision, but should indeed, one day, become reality. We need it – whether we get it with the Member States or despite them.
Schmitt (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are actually debating a regulation on the negotiation and conclusion of air service agreements. This heralds the end of a dispute that has exercised the Commission and the Member States for years, a dispute which unfortunately was not resolved politically at a time when this would still have made sense, but which finally had to be as it were set aside by virtue of a ruling of the European Court of Justice. In the past, the Member States continued to conclude bilateral air service agreements, which led to the internal market – which we had already made a reality in 1992 – being annulled in the air transport sector, ultimately reducing and restricting the opportunities and possibilities open to the Member States' airlines. It is therefore logical – and I fully agree with this – for our finally to have a Community agreement between the European Union and the United States, so that, competing as a European continent, we can use the opportunities that the USA has already been using for years in our Member States. I do not quite follow the Commission's comments and have also made this clear in my report: the Commission referred, no doubt partly out of annoyance and partly out of frustration after years of trying to persuade the Council to give it a negotiating mandate, to illegality, and in so doing it may now have thrown the baby out with the bathwater! If Commissioner Barnier said that the Council had already more or less accepted that in the future Member States would have to present the results of their bilateral negotiations for approval, then I think we are a long way from what we have discussed so intensively in the past and have also written in the Constitutional Treaty, namely from the principle of subsidiarity. Even allowing for the annoyance and the exuberance, I certainly cannot go along with the Commission's approach here, that it is now trying to treat the Member States like small children in what is after all an important issue for the national airlines. I am not disputing the fact that in the future the Community will have to lead the negotiations in certain areas, that is right and proper, not least because of the equivalence that needs to be established. As you rightly pointed out, however, there are over 2000 national bilateral air service agreements and these air service agreements will have to be developed further, they will have to be maintained and new ones will have to be added to their number. I think it is right and proper, where there is no obligation and no need for a Community agreement, to leave these in the sovereignty of the Member States. That these national agreements obviously have to be in accordance with Community law is, as I see it, not in question, but it is unacceptable for the spontaneity and sovereignty of the Member States to be restricted in such a way that, for each agreement, they not only, as it were, have to report that the negotiations have started, but also present the results and have them approved by the Commission. I will say again very clearly that I have tried to put this in a slightly different way in my report, and I have not gone along with the Commission's proposal, which has been made once again clearly by Commissioner Barnier. I think that the Commission should restrict itself to those areas where there is a need for the Community to negotiate, and that otherwise the Member States should continue to have the right to negotiate, obviously subject to Community law and the Commission's right, if need be, to intervene. I am confident, when I say a dispute is drawing to an end, that at the latest at the second reading a solution will be found that is acceptable to the Council, the Commission and Parliament. Until recently talks were still being held to achieve this, because there is a willingness on all sides to give a little more ground. The Member States are prepared to accept committing themselves to incorporating certain standard clauses in future air service agreements, and I therefore think that we will be able, despite our still differing starting positions, to settle this in good time to the mutual satisfaction of all parties. I would like to address one final point, because of course next we will be moving straight on to the vote, and that is Amendment No 17. This amendment, which unfortunately – and I use the word advisedly – received majority support in the committee, states that the 'polluter pays' principle should play a role in future agreements. I wish to point out once more that the negotiation of air service agreements is concerned exclusively with which traffic rights are retained and which can be used and I have absolutely no idea what the 'polluter pays' principle is doing in an air service agreement about these traffic rights. Obviously we can write a great deal in regulations, but anything that does not belong there should be taken out again, because it is irrelevant in this context. That is why I would earnestly request that when the time comes you do not vote in favour of Amendment No 17. (Sustained applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing thanks to the rapporteurs, who – not only at first reading stage but also at the second – had, in essence, to start their work all over again after the Council was so eccentric as to reformulate the Common Position in such a way that it was impossible to tell which of Parliament’s amendments had been taken up and which had not. One may well wonder whether this is just a haughtily offhand attitude, or whether there is a system at work here. I believe it to be the latter, because the Member States are simply unwilling to accept these undoubtedly forward-looking rules, but I will also make it abundantly clear that Parliament champions the cause of the Single Sky, one that will guarantee greater safety and also greater efficiency. I would like to list four points that I believe should be regarded as essentials. Firstly, the military cannot be allowed to continue to dominate European airspace. This is about bringing about proper coordination, in which civil and military air operators are partners with equal rights, and with the certainty that they are able to cooperate with each other. Secondly, in the air, too, the European patchwork must be done away with once and for all. Nobody, after all, can grasp how it is that we still have almost forty blocks of airspace in the skies above fifteen Member States long after land borders have been abolished. The issue of whose decision this should be is of the utmost importance, as the Member States have had enough time over the past decades to take the decision to create cross-border airspace blocks. They failed to do so, and so, I believe, the decision passes to the European level – to the Commission. My third point is that we want air safety services to be cautiously opened up to the market. My fourth is that we want mandatory harmonisation of both technology and of the training of air traffic controllers, as a means to making both technology and human resources mutually compatible. Today marks the first anniversary of the terrible air disaster on Lake Constance. Whilst that has no direct connection with this regulation, it does indicate the potential dangers inherent in a multiplicity of airspace blocks, in which the airlines constantly have to announce their entry and exit, with all the potential for misunderstanding that is involved. What this means is that we have the responsibility of ensuring safety and efficiency. If my judgment is correct, I can only say that my group will not be held responsible for regulations that do not end up giving real competence to the European level, along with the power to implement it. I want to make an urgent appeal to the Commission. Commissioner, I am somewhat surprised; you have narrowed the scope to some extent, and your staff were even more cautious, but, otherwise, on many aspects, you have demanded much more, and, if I may mention open skies, where you want all powers granted to you at once, you have suddenly started to hold back on this important issue. I ask you to consider on which side you are fighting. Join forces with Parliament, so that we may have a common European sky, in the interests of the people in the countries from which we come.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Posselt, in agreement with the shadow rapporteur, Mr Schmid from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we felt it was more appropriate to vote this afternoon when most of the Members are here. There was a lengthy discussion on this matter in the committee and this report is largely uncontentious. After all, there are no further proposed amendments, and that was why I felt it was sensible, and would ask the plenary to agree, that the vote be held this afternoon when all the Members are still here.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at times in this debate you get the impression that we have been building a European Union for only a short time and are addressing issues that actually ought to have been dealt with long ago. It is inherent in the very concept of the internal market that freight and passenger transport should have an appeal that gains them acceptance. The national railway companies' actions in recent years have predominantly been characterised by the fact that they have continued to try to cordon off their markets, while at the same time coming to terms with the consistent and dramatic decline in their figures in the freight transport sector. The only way of putting freight transport back on track at all is to ensure, firstly, that cross-border journeys can operate more smoothly in the future and, secondly, that the market is opened up and competition introduced, so that those who wish to offer attractive freight transport services have the opportunity to do so, and – so far at least –it has usually not been the national rail companies that have done this. When I hear people argue that liberalisation would mean job cuts then I only have one thing to say in reply: if the current trend continues there will not be any jobs in the rail freight sector at all, a result of the railways' conscious decision to neglect freight transport because it is not worth their while. I can only say that those who are well intentioned towards the railways have to ensure that the rail systems are compatible across Europe, that the highest safety requirements are put in place and, in addition, they must ensure that the railways are customer-friendly, which means that they should be reliable, that they should have attractive services on offer and that they should stick to their timetables. I can only hope that we and the Commissioner can push this through together in the Council. Measures in other areas – the Single European Sky to name but one example, when we wanted to have Europe designate airspace blocks in the future, because the national Member States had been failing to do so for decades – were repeatedly blocked by the Council, because they thought that all of this could be resolved bilaterally. I can only say that the Member States should have done it long ago, and now we are going to do it instead! (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to preface what I have to say with a few words of gratitude addressed to both rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, taking as I do the view that both reports have been drafted with great care and have also demonstrated a very responsible approach to their subject-matter. Let me also say that I am grateful for their willingness, in preparation for the votes in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to work together in seeking compromises and ways ahead, in which we largely succeeded. I also wish to thank the Commissioner, who has indeed invested a great deal of commitment in this project, and I do believe that, without her sustained efforts, we might well not have reached the point we have come to today, of being able to complete the first reading of a project of this sort. There is, however, something I would like to add. I was rather surprised, Commissioner, that you take such a critical view of the many amendments that Parliament has adopted, and which I have taken a quick second look at, and raise the prospect of your being unable to accept them. I do think you should take a closer look and see Parliament as the partner you will need if you are to be able to successfully and consistently put the case for this joint project of ours to the Council. We find ourselves today talking about a situation that has long been a reality on the ground. It has, in the meantime, become the norm for goods, just as much as people, to be able to cross the borders at will, at whatever time and in whatever manner. This freedom on the ground must actually have originated in the heavens, as it seems far less problematic to set down borders in the sky than to remove them on earth. Things have turned out differently now, though, and the public, the people who fly frequently, have expectations that are all the greater and all the more pressing; it is they who are telling us to at last get on with politics and sort matters out. It is the fact that the present position is simply unsatisfactory that prompted our desire for a Single Sky. Let me make that clearer by giving some examples. The situation in Europe today is that one out of every four flights is delayed. A proportion of the delays can be attributed to the fact that airspace is overstretched, and it is overstretched because we have this catastrophic situation with a fragmented sky. Every year, 350 000 flying hours are wasted because the direct route goes over military areas which may not be overflown, which means that aircraft have to fly by circuitous routes. We also have the situation today in which there are 41 blocks of airspace in 15 EU Member States. I always like to illustrate that by the example of an airline pilot who, on a flight from Rome to Brussels, has to fly through nine different blocks of airspace, meaning that he has to report in and out nine times. Misunderstandings are of course always possible and linguistic problems can crop up, so if anyone tries to tell me there are no additional potential hazards here, he is off beam. This makes it clear that we must make a long-overdue change here. I see these proposals as likely to give the sky a new architecture, create functional blocks of airspace and thereby ensure that, on the one hand, we increase capacity – which the increase in air traffic makes urgently necessary – and on the other, we enhance safety by minimising potential dangers from the outset, are able to reduce costs and so make flying cheaper and, finally and particularly, that we do the environment a favour by cutting at a stroke the 350 000 unnecessary flying hours to which I have already referred. So we have our eyes on the right objective, but I will also say that I am sure there are a number of points we could subject to critical discussion, and I know that one or other of my fellow-Members of this House has doubts about whether this or that is the right way to go ahead. In the Committee, we tried to add certain things. One I will mention is an industry consultation body, as we felt it was right that both the users and the manufacturers should be more involved in the project, to prevent us coming up with something that later proves unusable, or, on the other hand, from requirements bearing no relation to the products that come on the market. The fact is that, as well as the fragmentation represented by the 41 zones in the sky, Europe is fragmented in the field of technology. I believe that our technologies must also be modernised and harmonised as soon as possible. Like Mr Stockmann, who tabled an amendment on the subject, I would have liked us to go a step further by creating a European supervisory authority and removing this area much more from the nation states. I know that to be, at the moment, a chimera, but my relative youth gives me hope that we will today take the plunge and take an important second step by declaring our desire for a Single European Sky, deciding on the political objective, and then going down the road the Commission has pointed out to us. Thus we may hope that, at some point in the next ten or twenty years, there really will be a Single European Sky with a European supervisory authority, which will of course safeguard national interests. So I ask you to vote for these projects by a large majority.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves today at the second reading stage of a draft Regulation that I regard as being of great significance and which in particular makes one thing clear, namely that, particularly through the committed involvement of the responsible Commissioner, the lack of what should long ago have been a matter of fact in the field of air travel has, in recent months, at length been successfully made good. I refer to the fact that air travel should know no frontiers and regulations and safety measures affecting air travel should naturally, therefore, also be without borders, meaning, in this instance, that they should be organised, as is appropriate, on a uniform basis across Europe or at least throughout the Member States. The regulation we are reading for the second time establishes an agency for aviation safety and ensures that assessments will in future be made uniformly as to which aircraft are to be built in accordance with which criteria before being licensed to enter service. It is obvious that the uniform assessment of designs makes this step significant in terms of air safety, but it is in my view also self-evidently essential to the aircraft industry, which has hitherto had to apply for authorisation in each individual Member State, but will in future be in a position to sort these problems out with one authority and with one agency, and get the relevant certification from them. The task of the Aviation Safety Agency will be to approve aircraft, certify them and oversee their operation. At the same time, supervision of the flight crew, as also maintenance and other measures, all of which are factors in aviation safety, are in future to be regulated by law, something for which we clearly expressed a desire during discussions in committee and during preparations for second reading. Let me repeat the clear message that this regulation's principal objective is the creation of a uniformly high standard for aviation safety in Europe. There are of course further objectives or knock-on effects associated with this, which can be described quite briefly. These are, on the one hand, greater cost-effectiveness for the aircraft industry, and on the other, which I consider equally important, the fact that it will be guaranteed that relevant standards will be interpreted in a uniform way, thus promoting and enhancing the Community's position in the world, that is, with especial reference to the American situation. The committee's concern was that the Aviation Safety Agency's general political independence, for the issues involved are exclusively of a technical nature, in which decisions are to be taken by authoritative experts and specialists rather than by politicians in Parliament or the Council. It was also important to guarantee the Agency's autonomy, meaning that the Executive Director really is the head of the authority and, at the same time, that the Management Board is in a position to lay down appropriate guidelines for the Agency and influence the way in which it works. I know that this puts us into a conflict situation with the Council and the Commission, but I believe that our numerous discussions have brought solutions which of course ensure that the Commission's responsibility is made clear, that it will continue, so to speak, to supervise the Aviation Safety Agency, but that it is clear at the same time that the Aviation Safety Agency must also take responsibility for itself in its area of expertise. I am confident that a conciliation procedure will be avoided, that we will be able to activate this regulation with the Council's agreement, and that the Agency will indeed be able to start work twelve months after that. We have, in my judgment, taken a great step forward in the area of aviation safety. I will take this opportunity to thank all of those who set this legislative project in motion and supported it, especially my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Transport and Tourism. I also thank the Commission and the Council for their willingness to seek compromises, and now hope that today's vote will enable us to complete this report, and that we will then begin a new chapter in the history of aviation safety in Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor only in order to point out a small textual error that has crept in during the proceedings. It is in Amendment No 15(1)(d). The word ‘relevant’ needs to be inserted before the word ‘premises’. There are different versions of the text; in some of them the word is completely absent, whilst in others it has become ‘any’. I therefore ask for it to be corrected to read: ‘relevant premises, land, or means of transport.’

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Meijer, I would like to say in advance that I actually want to say a word of thanks to you, as I know with what commitment you have sought to introduce this subject and how many discussions you have had in order to produce some sort of proposal. I must, though, say on this point that I cannot go along with broad areas of your proposal. There is, in principle, nothing new about what we are discussing today. When, in the summer of 2000, the regulation at last emerged from the Commission, reached Parliament, and then the first discussions were held with trade unions and the representatives of local transport bodies and voluntary organisations, everything was clear: There was to be controlled competition. This had been the aim for years, and now we only had to deal with the questions of how long future contracts should run for and when the regulation was to enter into force, in other words, when would the first tenders actually be invited and the first contracts awarded? There was the additional question of what exceptions there should be to the obligation to put contracts out to tender. All that had its part to play, as did the recurrently raised issue of social dumping, that is, the danger that tenders would lead to the employment of especially cheap labour. We came to a consensus. We wanted controlled competition without privatisation. The two are always confused with one another. Privatisation is not automatically connected with it. All that is involved is that local transport bodies no longer automatically come into the enjoyment of substantial subsidies from regional, national or local funds without having to compete for them, but contracts will now have to be put out to tender. We all know that local transport bodies, who know this themselves, basically offer their product at too high a price. The cause of this is to be found in the fact that it is in the public sector that trade unions have always been very successful in pay negotiations in recent decades. It is a truism, to give just one example, that the personnel costs of private bus companies are some 35-40% lower than in the public sector. Competition also opens up the possibility of us being in a position, in the future, to buy in transport services more cheaply, without a local authority being able to evade its responsibilities in the process. It is not the case that they are being privatised. There will continue to be a State office with responsibility for ensuring that public transport carries on. I can see the opportunity of using the resources saved by buying-in transport at more favourable rates to buy in more transport in the future, thereby making short-distance transport more attractive and achieving all that was said at the outset, namely making transport so attractive, that more people will use it in the future. Let me say that, following these lengthy preliminaries, I think there has almost been a catastrophe, because Mr Meijer was evidently unsure which way he should go, and proposed that, in future, the responsible bodies, whether the regional or local government, should be entitled to decide whether or not to invite tenders. I forecast that if this right to choose, which is to be introduced into the bill by means of Amendment No 61 and Article 7a, becomes reality, there will be no competition, because pressure from the transport companies, trade unions, and associations will be so great as to be irresistible, and contracts will continue to be awarded automatically. Though we can disagree about many details, I therefore beg you, ladies and gentlemen, to seriously reconsider your decision tomorrow and not to vote in favour of Amendment No 61, so that contracts will continue to have to be put out to tender, exceptions being made for rural areas where only small sums are involved, but let us march in the same direction.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, I believe that the Committee, which adopted this version of the report by a majority, is on the wrong track. Let me explain briefly what I mean. About a year ago, when the Commission submitted its working document, we attempted to reach a compromise on this very difficult and sensitive issue. We agreed that we would distinguish between three specific groups: firstly, asylum seekers; secondly, persons who come to us on a temporary basis from crisis regions; and finally, people who wish to migrate to the Member States in order to make their lives here. In particular, we all recognised that we could only regulate the last pillar, that is, immigration, sensibly by ensuring that the number – I am choosing my words carefully – of unfounded asylum applications can be reduced, at least that we can process them consistently. We all know that no more than 10% or 15% of the applications submitted are genuinely well-founded and likely to be recognised under the Geneva Convention. This is where the Committee and a majority of its members have made two errors, in my view: firstly, it has abandoned the consensus which we worked so hard to achieve and, secondly, it has done no service at all to genuine applicants who are politically persecuted, because it also treats everyone who enters Germany or another Member State without a well-founded claim in more or less the same way and thus undermines the standing of genuine applicants. Expanding the rights of asylum to include new forms of (non-state) persecution, restricting the opportunities of Member States – at least those Member States which have to cope with large influxes – to make effective use of the ‘safe country of origin’ principle, but also the issue of how manifestly unfounded applications should be dealt with – indeed, the entire contents of this report – means that there is longer any way of taking effective action when large numbers of unfounded applications are made. I appeal to you yet again! I know this is a difficult issue. I also know this is a sensitive issue. However, let us try to uphold the details of these common pillars which we discussed a year ago, and where there was plenty of scope to reach a consensus. I hope that the German Social Democrats – who adopt an entirely different tone in their dealings with their Home Affairs Minister in Germany – might change their voting behaviour today. I also hope that we will again find a way of achieving consensus which will enhance the status of those who have genuinely suffered political persecution and seek asylum in the Member States.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the regulation creating a European Aviation Safety Agency was welcomed by all groups in committee. Basically, this regulation needs to take account of three points. First, and this has always been the most important point, once there is a liberalised air traffic market, which will give rise to new competitive pressures and the risk of using competition to cut costs, cost cuts must not be made at the expense of safety. That is why I say, loud and clear, that this regulation is a sign that we want to guarantee a uniformly high standard of safety in the EU Member States in future and ensure that it is identical in every state. The second point is also, I think, an important aspect to bear in mind, despite the fact that it often receives short shift in policy. There are also economic policy aspects to this regulation because, in it, we are creating an authority or, more accurately, an agency which brings all the licences and permits needed for the air travel industry under one uniform licensing procedure. That means that, in future, individual Member States will not need to repeat the entire procedure and everything will be taken care of by this standard agency in the European Union. 	 A third point also needs highlighting. We are creating an agency which is a very similar institution to the agency which already exists in America. We all know that the FIA has quite a lot of clout – even worldwide – because it represents a nation which is a strong economic power. We Europeans are obviously limping along behind because individual nation states have less influence than a closed unit, i.e. an institution which represents all the Member States. That is why I think that this is a step in the right direction. The Commission proposal before us was discussed at several meetings in committee and we endeavoured, I will not say to improve certain positions, because that always sounds as if we think those who prepared it did a bad job; we endeavoured to lighten the Commission decision, to make the agency more independent, because we felt that the prime concern of this sort of agency should be to improve air traffic safety, so we tried to ensure that it has plenty of room for manoeuvre. Now we all know that, under the current Treaties, a fully independent agency is out of the question. But we do feel that the Commission should give the agency enough leeway to carry out some sort of legal supervision and perhaps some sort of technical supervision in certain secondary areas. We were therefore right in saying that we want an independent agency and I think it was also important that we said that the administrative board must be given a stronger remit, on the one hand, and that the executive director must be given a position that allows him a degree of independence as the head of such an agency, on the other. There is another important aspect which I should like to make a point of addressing here. We endeavoured in committee to draw clear dividing lines between the various areas of jurisdiction. As Parliament, we deliberately avoided accepting the Commission proposal of a seat on the administrative board. Instead we said, we want it to be perfectly clear that Parliament lays down the basic specifications, the Commission is the contact for the corresponding implementing provisions and the agency has to ensure that the technical details are properly regulated. To summarise, because I am running out of time, I think that this regulation is the right move. We are making sure that the European level takes action in an area which is of interest to a great many people and which a great many people worry about. And I say to you quite unequivocally that airspace and safety should know no bounds and this agency is therefore well placed at European level. I therefore call on the House join with me in voting in favour of this report tomorrow.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Simpson, we have to agree with much of what you said. It is true that it became clear in 1989 with the liberalisation package that the European Community must not only ensure fair competition but must also ensure safety in aviation. The present amendment of the regulation aims to do that and I think it is right for the European institutions to clearly assume their responsibility. That means that if we are responsible for regulating aviation safety in Europe, we must also take the appropriate action. But at the same time we must also make it clear that Parliament and political bodies such as the Commission and the Council should not disregard the vote of experts. So I very much welcome the fact that we held a very pragmatic debate in committee and nobody really tried to enter into the details of the technical rules or, so to speak, to put political knowledge above the knowledge of the experts. You quite rightly also pointed out, and I think that is quite clear, that we need rules on duty time, and I myself am surprised that in spite of this long process the social partners have still not managed to put rules together. That is why I also think it is right for us as Parliament to make it clear once again that we expect the social partners airlines and employees' representatives to fulfil their obligation. We are prepared to introduce this into the regulation too, at second reading. On the other hand, we are equally prepared to put our own rules in place if the social partners do not fulfil their obligation. For one thing is quite clear: safety in aviation must take priority. Yet safety in aviation cannot be ensured just by having rules, especially not overarching rules. That is why I also say quite plainly: however much we can agree with large sections of the report, we do not consider it appropriate for Parliament to introduce its own detailed provisions into this regulation in certain areas under the heading, for instance, of "one cabin crew member operations" or length of experience, i.e. how long someone has already served as a cabin crew member. So unfortunately we will not be able to vote for your Amendments Nos 9 and 10, which concern such proposals. I was somewhat surprised to see how intently the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered and discussed the question of hand baggage. In my view that is not an issue for a parliament to discuss and I can only say to Mr Simpson and my other colleagues: let the airlines regulate that; it is not the job of Members.
Schmitt (PPE-DE

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Amsterdam has at last paved the way for joint action in the area of asylum law and refugee and immigration policy. In my view, this was long overdue, because the decision to move from a purely economic community to political union was taken a long time ago. That the Treaty of Amsterdam moved in this direction was therefore all the more important. Unfortunately, when it happened, Parliament was only granted the right to be consulted on moves in the relevant legal areas, which is why I expressly state here that I trust that the Commission will continue to ensure that Parliament remains fully involved, despite the fact that it only has a right of consultation. Having said which, one thing must be made clear: given that, officially, we only have the right to be consulted, we shall only have any effective influence on the Commission and on how the relevant legal provisions develop if we, as a Parliament, agree on common principles and waive the need for full implementation of individual political goals. I think that we have chosen a good approach to this issue over recent months during our discussions of the Commission’s working paper. I know from my own group, I must add, that, because of how the report is drafted, the view of hardly anyone here in the House is wholly represented. That is precisely what happens when you make compromises and try to find a consensus. You are satisfied on many points, but not always 100%. Allow me to highlight the main points which I think are important for future asylum procedures. First: we must summon up the courage to separate the three main groups, i.e. asylum, on the one hand, and the temporary admission of refugees from crisis regions and immigration policy, on the other. Secondly: we must ensure that qualification procedures are shortened and simplified, without sacrificing sufficiently high standards of careful examination. Thirdly: our aim must be to allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum just once within the European Union. However, this means ensuring the same procedural law applies everywhere and is applied uniformly. This means training officials in charge of processing applications to a high standard. These officials must have access to cross-border information. And we must also ensure that asylum seekers are treated in exactly the same way, wherever they make their application. This includes welfare, accommodation etc. We need to guarantee that, in theory, you will face the same procedure everywhere, irrespective of whether you make your application in Spain, Germany or England. If we can guarantee that, then inversely, it is only logical to rule that just one application is allowed. Fourthly: I think that the Member States of the EU should be required to draw up a uniform, binding list of countries subject to a visa requirement and safe third countries and countries of origin. I know that some people are critical of this. But, in my view, it is the only way to ensure that officials take decisions on the basis of the same criteria and to create legal certainty for applicants in the Member States. One important point which I should like to address, and which we have made clear several times in the report, is that the burden must be divided between the Member States. How exactly this burden will be divided obviously still needs to be discussed. But one thing is clear: the door on which the majority of asylum seekers or refugees knocks cannot be left to chance. One country alone should not have to bear the burden. I know that asylum law is a difficult and politically sensitive issue but I think that we have made a start in the discussions in committee over recent months. We have discussed extremely constructively and fairly with each other. This discussion has encouraged me and I am convinced that Parliament is now in a position to give its joint support to the continuing legislative process and, possibly, to discuss other difficult issues, such as an immigration law, constructively.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supported Mr Sterckx’s report in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as it will support it in plenary. The key message, as Mr Sterckx has reiterated, is that basically liberalisation has succeeded in principle. As a result we now have substantially more competition. This stronger competition has also created some movement in price levels, not in all market areas, certainly, but in many of them. Furthermore, what many people feared has not come to pass, namely job losses and deteriorating working conditions, and instead we continue to see rising employment. In the space of about eight years, employment figures have risen by nearly 50 000 and there really has been no evidence of a lasting decline in working conditions unless we look at this in the context of what has happened nationally, which is that national airlines are in a sense being transformed into modern service industries, which is, of course, accompanied by changes in working conditions and their modernisation. Nonetheless I am glad that the report does address the fact that we, of course, expect common rules – even if for a different reason, namely because of safety aspects –with regard, for instance, to working hours and flight times, because, at the end of the day, it is training and actual working conditions that will partly determine how safe we can make European aviation over the long term. Mr Sterckx also made it clear, however, that liberalisation concerns only a very small area of European air transport, which can largely be regarded as successful, but there are many other areas that currently continue to give us problems, whether these are old, unresolved problems or new ones. We are a long way from having a uniform, common European air transport market, in principle. I think in future we will have to deal with four important points. Mr Sterckx has already addressed some of them, and I would like to raise them again. In my view, the Member States’ airlines must, of course, be in a position to have equal access to the international market, like other airlines in the world. At the same time, we must ensure that the airline companies really do achieve economic stability, which means we have to try to ensure, through appropriate competition on the ground, that the immense costs of, for instance, landing and ground handling charges are reduced to the kind of level that is usual in other countries of the world. Secondly, let me emphasise that we do want to see more air transport. It enhances individual mobility. But, on the other hand, we must not disregard environmental conditions. My position is fairly clear on this point. Bans are not the right method; instead we need incentives, we need to give support for the airlines to move towards reducing emissions by using modern fleets that use less kerosene and also produce less pollution. Thirdly, in my view we need to improve consumer protection because obviously the growing number of passengers brings increasing problems with it and, in this regard, the passenger deserves more protection than the airline. My fourth and final point, and the one I consider most important, is that we must ensure that we also have a single European airspace and we must establish a uniform system of air traffic control in order to reduce delays and congestion.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, although I do think that what Mr Cushnahan said is of course highly credible, the point at issue is not whether we feel like puppets – which I do not believe that we are – and nor is it a case of us giving priority to commercial considerations, as Mr Gahrton said. Something quite different is at stake. It is what Commissioner Patten was talking about in relation to the Middle East this morning; it is about avoiding a clash of civilisations. It is about how, by working towards intercultural dialogue, we Europeans are performing what is a primary task for our own age and for our world. Whatever the reservations expressed in this debate, Pakistan very definitely has a positive role to play in this. The question at issue is: who is our partner? North Korea is not one, but Pakistan is a partner in the fight against international terrorism, and the coalition ranged against that is of course much greater than the coalition of states at present in Iraq fighting terrorism there and fighting against the regime. The coalition combating international terrorism includes Germany, France, Russia and others. Pakistan is among them. It is for that reason that I believe that the conclusion of the Third Generation Agreement is a matter of the utmost urgency.

 Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for his constructive and very close cooperation over the years. The Czech Republic’s successes over the last few years are beyond dispute. There are still deficits in some areas, however, on standards in food-processing establishments, for example. Our consumers need have no fear, however; nothing that fails to meet our standards will be allowed in the EU internal market. Another problem that has increasingly been brought to my attention recently is the suspected trafficking in human beings and in particular children at the German-Czech border. The Czech Government should be encouraging victim support programmes here. There is also a need for training programmes for the police and border guards to increase awareness of the issue of people trafficking and there should be greater cross-border cooperation on the basis of INTERREG. So far as the plans for barrages on the upper reaches of the Elbe are concerned, I have managed to persuade the EU Commission that an environmental impact assessment for this project is absolutely essential and that intermodal alternatives must be worked out. I live in the Elbe valley in Saxony, which was flooded in summer 2002, and I know what I am talking about. Finally, I want to talk about the Czech parliament’s intention of honouring the former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš. When we have spent years dealing with the matter of the Beneš decrees here in Parliament and I found a compromise formula that was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the plenum in April last year, I find it insensitive and provocative of the Czechs now, just before the country is to join the EU, to be passing a law that not only evokes the past but actually honours it. I do not want anyone who supports this law joining my Group in the future.

 Madam President, Commissioner Vitorino was right to refer to the very special relationship we have with Canada, which is in the process of being raised to a higher level. You mentioned, Commissioner, that our models of society are identical or very similar. It is indeed the case that Canada is a large country endeavouring not only to permit but also to promote cultural diversity within itself, and so certain analogies with the situation in the European Union present themselves, since our structure differs from, say, the United States of America. Cultural diversity is present in our European Union too, a diversity that will become even more marked following the accession of new countries next year. You also mentioned, Commissioner, that we have the same global interests, and this goes hand in hand with the other aspect you mentioned, our shared social model. Our global interests are in the field of foreign and security policy. Particularly after 11 September, we have to engage in a global cultural dialogue, for a clash of civilizations, a choc des civilisations
 will get us nowhere. In the final analysis, international terrorism cannot be fought by military means. This leads me to mention another aspect, which is that although Canada, that great country, is in North America, it is one in which French is spoken. Intercultural dialogue, especially between the United States of America and the Islamic world, grinds to a halt if it is conducted only in English. I think there is great potential if France joins Canada in promoting such dialogue. Canada can be a mediator between the USA and the Islamic world. Not least is this in the interests of our most important partner, the United States of America. Let me conclude by adding that I believe that our relationship with Canada functions as a model. Now that the Iron Curtain has ceased to be, we are quite right to work towards a balanced relationship with Central and Eastern Europe and also with those Eastern European countries that will very probably never belong to the European Union, especially with Russia. We must never forget, though, that we must continue to look westwards; not only to the USA, but to our great ally Canada. Together with Canada, we must work towards global equilibrium in a multipolar world, and I believe that a productive relationship with Canada in this process is something the significance of which cannot be overestimated.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, if, as I hope, the European Parliament today votes by a very large majority for the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, individual Members’ motives for that decision may differ to some degree, but their motives will coincide on one point, namely that with our vote we want to seize an opportunity, an historic opportunity! I am fully aware how carefully the term ‘historic’ ought to be used. But there are situations where it would be a mistake to ignore the actual dimension of events, and we are faced today with one such situation with historic consequences. As rapporteur responsible for the Czech Republic, I have no reason to react with exuberance, let alone euphoria. The many unqualified statements by some Czech politicians in the past, statements made with an eye to the various election campaigns, have been too frustrating for that. We should be careful, though, not to deny the Czech people, a people at the heart of Europe, accession to the European Union simply because some opportunists, whose names will probably be almost forgotten in ten years’ time, have been guilty of verbal gaffes. We are left with the objection that the problem is not so much the many opportunists, both small and great, but the question of the possible continuing effect of the presidential decrees known to us as the Beneš Decrees. So far as this point is concerned, the Czechs have taken upon themselves the obligation to comply with the Copenhagen criterion that there can be no discrimination against minorities. Should anyone in the Czech Republic nevertheless be in breach of that after European Union accession, as a community of justice the EU can and will take appropriate action. The fact that neither government nor parliament in the Czech Republic have so far responded to our Parliament’s resolutions is disappointing and regrettable, as our group chairman has already made clear. President Vaclav Klaus’s political gesture should not, however, be played down. It is an encouraging sign that, a few weeks ago on the anniversary of the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia in March, the highest Czech representative expressed regret for the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans. It is a step in the right direction, which we may hope will be followed by others. In any case, we still need patience in our dealings with one another because coming to terms with history is something on which it is hard to impose a time frame. No one should think that the Czechs are the only ones having problems in dealing with their past; the phenomenon is not only found in all the countries of the former Eastern bloc, even long standing Member States of the European Union sometimes have problems with it. There is one thing of which we should be careful when dealing with the past. We are right to oppose collective condemnations, but are not those who do not want the Czechs in the EU simply because a few Czechs are unreasonable doing much the same thing? Someone has already pointed out today that we are not admitting governments, we are not admitting parties and groups, but we are admitting people, we are admitting nations. In this case, it is the Czech people that we are admitting, and integrating them into the European Union must and will be the key to developing a new legal culture, the European Union’s legal culture, in that country too. If the Czechs remain outside, we will have gained nothing. First, if the Czech younger generation in particular is able to move and develop in a wider democratic environment, the wounds that doubtless still exist on all sides will close and hopefully will one day heal completely. The people in today’s Czech Republic, who cannot be held personally responsible for what happened before they were born, should and must be given the opportunity to have a part in the European community of values with equal rights and equal obligations. Today we are holding the most important vote of this legislative period. Let us be aware of the historic implications of this vote; let us seize this opportunity by voting for the accession of the Czech Republic by a large majority. And, as a Member from Saxony, I would like to say to my neighbours: Drazí přátelé, vítáme Vás srdečně.

 Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his introductory speech, Mr Brok said something that is, basically, applicable to all the candidate countries, but also to the Czech Republic. There is still room for catching up in both the economic and administrative spheres. I do not wish to go into them in depth, as these things are basically not problematic, but will be resolved in the near future. Please permit me to concentrate on one point that is of especial significance – the decrees of President Edward Beneš, which we have discussed at very great length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. On behalf of our group, I have tabled a final amendment, which I would like to put before you now. It reads thus: ‘The European Parliament refers to the report commissioned by it and supports its common conclusions, namely that the presidential decrees do not pose an obstacle to Czech accession to the EU, meaning that all Union citizens will enjoy the same rights on Czech territory after accession, that all judgments handed down in absentia
 have been quashed, and that Law No. 115 of 8 May 1946 has no justification for its existence from the point of view of modern jurisprudence’ – let me repeat – ‘that Law No. 115 of 8 May 1946 has no justification for its existence from the point of view of modern jurisprudence; regards the statements of principle made in the German/Czech Declaration of 21 January 1997 as a sound basis for reconciliation, which represents the moral foundation for European integration; considers a political gesture by the Czechs to this effect as desirable
.’ This text respects the dignity of all those who suffered during the past decades, although it is important again to call to mind the sequence of the historic events. First came rule by the Nazis, then the Czech lands were occupied by Nazi-ruled Germany, then there was the war, and then came the expulsions. A very, very large number of people suffered – Czechs, Sudeten Germans, Hungarians, Roma and others. I believe that this text respects the dignity of all of them, but also respects the dignity of all those who live in the Czech Republic and in the European Union today, of all those who are alive, but had nothing personally to do with these events and who are looking forward, to whom it is the present and the future that matter. Beyond that, this text makes no demands and exerts no pressure on the Czech Republic. Let me conclude by saying that, as my final amendment does justice to all sides, I ask you to vote tomorrow to accept it, along with the report as a whole. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since time is short, I should like to focus on just one issue which has been mentioned several times already today, namely the presidential decrees. In this context, the Czech Parliament's declaration of 24 April 2002 is helpful, since it states that the presidential decrees cannot be the basis for any new legal relations today. However, there is one issue which concerns us, and that is whether discriminatory elements still exist in current Czech law, such as an act dating from 1992 on the restitution of property confiscated from its owners under Communism, which makes the restitution of property contingent on continuous Czech citizenship. We must establish whether this provision conforms with European law. The same applies to what is known as the 1946 Criminal Indemnity Act. In addition to clarifying these and other issues, a number of other problems will arise even after Czech accession to the EU. I am convinced that a clear signal from those who were expelled in 1945 and from their descendants would be helpful. This signal should make it clear that the property relations which emerged after the Second World War are inviolable, and should not be violated. If this signal were sent out, Czech fears could be assuaged, and people who are currently consumed by these fears could use their energies productively to prepare the Czech Republic for EU accession in 2004.

 Mr President, I do not wish to say anything about the content of my report on the Czech Republic. Anyone who has read it will also realise that the criticism that came from the Right at the end of this morning's debate was unjustified. It does, in fact, contain a number of observations on these points. Allow me to comment on the latest developments. In the past week it has emerged from the Czech Republic that the government has a very ambitious programme, namely that by June 2002 it wants to have met the accession criteria and therefore to regard the accession negotiations as closed. So far, 19 out of 31 chapters have been closed and by the end of the year a further six key chapters should be completed. Commissioner Verheugen rightly said that completing chapters is not the only thing that counts and that neither is it an indicator of how far a country is. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic is well on the way and we should not believe those who are confusing the people in the country. Only last week a leading Czech politician asserted that the European Union was a rigid, unwieldy and costly concern. With your permission, Mr President, I should like to analyse these three erroneously employed concepts. The European Union is not rigid. If there is one constant in the European Community – which today is the European Union – then it is the desire for change and the possibility of achieving it. Since the Fifties, the European Community has been constantly changing and today we are even facing the possibility and necessity of enlarging this Union once more. Anyone, therefore, who says that this organisation is rigid does not know what they are talking about. Secondly, I turn to the charge that it is unwieldy. We should not confuse two different things here. Of course the European Union is a large entity, but it is, nevertheless, manoeuvrable. It can be compared to a great ship sailing across a wide ocean. It can be manoeuvred and yet it is large, like the European Union. The decision-making process is certainly lengthy in the European Union and it is sometimes tedious as well, but what do you actually expect in a Community of 15 sovereign states, where each state – and, incidentally, not least the small ones – is asked what its position is? Everyone has a say, and this is something which those circles in the Czech Republic should bear in mind. So the Union is not unwieldy and it is not rigid either. The third argument, that it is costly, is actually the least accurate because the countries which freed themselves from communism would have had to undergo reform and a process of transformation anyway, regardless of accession to the European Union. There is a further point: there are two possibilities in the European Union, either you receive money or you contribute money. Those who receive money – and the Czech Republic is already one of them – actually ought not to complain at all. Those who contribute money have also shown over the last few decades that they fare very well when they pay money into the European Community or Union because somehow they always get it back again. These three arguments are therefore purely and simply populist, to put it mildly. My final comment on this is that where cost is concerned there are also things which should not be measured or explained in terms of marks and pfennigs or euros. These people in the Czech Republic who are blackening the name of the EU have forgotten one thing, namely our founding fathers' prime concern: peace in freedom. This is something which up until now has prevented wars and, by the way, expulsion. Despite a number of points which are explained in my report, for example in relation to Temelin, the Czech Republic is making good progress. No one should take fright; Temelin is not an obstacle to joining the European Union. Finally, allow me to make one further comment which I already made last year in my report. I am from Saxony, which borders the Czech Republic; in the past in socialist times I was in the same boat as the Czechs and I should also like to be in the future, but in a different boat, a boat which the Czechs can help to steer. Admittedly, no one in the Czech Republic should think that the Czechs will be the only ones deciding where the boat goes because it is not the European Union which wishes to join the Czech Republic but the Czechs who wish to join the EU. Nevertheless, the Czechs are guaranteed to be one of those helping to steer the course of the European Union in the future. (Applause)

 Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a most balanced report and then, if I may, I should like to comment on a strategic point which particularly concerns me. Following the political upheaval in central and eastern Europe, association agreements were concluded in a bid to help these countries one day become members of the European Community or Union. Ukraine was not one of them. The question of the borders of Europe, which reappeared on the agenda with the fall of the Iron Curtain, has never been seriously discussed here, and hence nor has the fate of Ukraine. However, the answer to the question of the borders of Europe is that Europe does not end east of Bulgaria because that is where Ukraine lies, and not just Ukraine. Europe’s borders cannot be determined unequivocally, which is why the complete enlargement of the European Union is a contradiction in terms. The current enlargement concept will inevitably bring about new divisive borders in Europe, for example between Poland and Ukraine. This is a huge problem, which is why we need a new concept. Since 1989/90, Europe has no longer been politically or geographically divided; it has become an open continent. What sort of concept do I mean? The principle of exclusivity, whereby a candidate country is either fully assimilated into the EU or is completely excluded should be replaced by the following concept: any country which thinks of itself as either partly or wholly European, such as Ukraine, should be given the opportunity to decide if, and to what extent, it is willing and able to subscribe to European policy. This would maintain the vision of the founding fathers of a free Europe in the dialectic sense and allow us to focus again on the crux of the matter, as formulated at the time, namely to create peace in freedom for all the nations of Europe.

 Mr President, as rapporteur in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on preparations for the accession of the Czech Republic, I have a request to make of you. It has come to our attention that a member of the Czech Parliament, Mr Ivan Pilip, has been arrested in Cuba. He has evidently been accused of spying. The truth is that he met civil rights campaigners and that his actions were quite normal for a member of a freely elected parliament. Mr President, I urge you to arrange for a request to be made to the Cuban authorities for Mr Pilip and those accompanying him to be released immediately, because the Cuban regime does not have any moral grounds for giving lessons in democracy to members of a freely elected parliament. I have all the more reason for asking you this given that in April this year a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is due to take place in Cuba. How can one possibly justify holding a meeting of this kind in a country where members of parliament are arrested if they talk to civil rights campaigners?
Schröder, Jürgen (PPE-DE

Mr President, Commissioner, the subject of my report is the Czech Republic and its request to become a member of the European Union. Not only are the Czechs my immediate neighbours; as a citizen of Saxony, I sat in exactly the same boat as them, as it were, for decades. I should now like the Czechs to come back on board as soon as possible, this time in a boat which is solid and the course of which the Czechs can help plot. My good wishes apart, a report on the progress of the Czech Republic towards accession to the European Union must, of course, be as objective as possible. The objectivity of my report is certified by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Plus, the report has been enriched by contributions from my fellow members in all the groups, whom I thank. I was delighted that my report was adopted unanimously in committee on 14 September. The criticism levied by the European Commission in its regular report in 1999, was not enthusiastically received by the Czech Republic, but it understood that it was meant to be helpful. There has since been a push forward in the Czech Republic. There has been progress in the economic area. After a three-year recession, the economy has turned around. In central and eastern Europe, the Czech Republic has the second highest per capita income after Slovenia. As a result of clever fiscal policy, direct foreign investment topped EUR 5.45 billion last year. There were also positive developments in the privatisation of the banking system. As far as cause for criticism is concerned, as I state in my report, the European Parliament stresses the need to ensure a high standard of safety at nuclear facilities and to carry out the relevant environmental impact assessments. It also calls for the judiciary to be improved in order to address the problem of corruption, which the Commissioner has already discussed, and to achieve more secure rule of law. One problem specific to the Czech Republic, especially on the German-Czech border, is the problem of prostitution, especially child prostitution. This problem does not exist solely on the Czech side, it exists on both sides and it is therefore a problem which we must resolve jointly. There is still one point which crops up constantly when talk turns to the Czech Republic and that is the problem of the Roma. We acknowledged in committee that this problem is a complex social problem, including in the Czech Republic. Parliament supports the Czech Republic in continuing efforts to improve the standard of living of the Roma minority, but calls on the Czech Government to take further specific measures to integrate the Roma economically and socially. There is also a paragraph in my report dealing with the decrees of the Beneš government. We are delighted that the Czech government is prepared to review the decrees dating from 1945 and 1946 in order to ascertain whether they run counter to the EU law in force and the Copenhagen criteria. I should like to state quite clearly at this point that this is not some sort of attempt to rewrite history on our part. There is no question of that. It is Today and, more importantly, Tomorrow, which are at stake. What is important to me – and my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy supported me here – is that the Copenhagen criteria, which the Czechs have also acknowledged, should continue to apply and I should like the Czechs themselves to review their own legal system, if necessary page by page, in order to ascertain if there are any laws which are discriminatory. We should not interfere, especially we Germans! (Applause)
 After the fall of the Communist system a decade ago, the Czech Republic underwent radical change which the majority of the people wanted and supported, but which also demanded huge effort and endeavour on their part. Numerous weaknesses still present in this country are the legacy of decades of dictatorship. In this respect, politicians from the part of Europe for which a happier fate was in store after the Second World War would do well to be sparing with their criticism of countries like the Czech Republic.

Mr President, allow me to pick up where my colleague Mr Gawronski left off, namely the acceptance of Europe among the people of the various countries seeking to join the European Union. It is not only Poland; other countries, such as the Czech Republic, also keep their enthusiasm for the European Union in check. I should like to point out that the Commission’s progress report on the Czech Republic refers to a medium-sized town in the Czechia where a fence has been built down a street to separate the Czechs from the Romas. That is hardly progress. I have been there twice, I have spoken to the mayor, I said the fence must go and what happened? The tabloid press of Europe is calling this fence a wall, as if it were not only the Berlin wall but the great wall of China. It has been so blown up that the people there are, understandably, extremely angry because they assume that there is sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander in the European Union. We have one set of rules for ourselves, and we are far from whiter than white, and we have another set of rules for applicant countries and we expect everything of them which we ourselves fail to deliver. When we in the European Union take a look around us, at ethnic conflicts and terrorist attacks, I think that, if the boot were on the other foot, for example, if the Czech Republic were already in the Union, then it would say to a certain Member State: friend, if you do not get your house in order, then you must wait another twenty years before you become a Member State. I simply mean we should make sure that the people are not put off. The point is, we do not need to get on with the politicians in the applicant countries, but with the people. That is all that counts.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the premise, which is repeated again and again here, according to which Turkey would have to fulfil specific conditions to become a Member of the European Union, is a false one. Just imagine if the Turks were actually to fulfil the criteria! We, in the European Union would be in no position whatsoever to integrate Turkey. That is the reality! For we have a principle in this European Union of ours, the socialist principle of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. We call it economic and social cohesion. If Turkey were to become a Member of the European Union, then of course Turkey would also have a claim in having this principle respected. The European Union would be completely overtaxed by this. What we are planning now, is already a show of strength of the first order, i.e. integrating the Poles, the Czechs and Hungary, whom I would have in the European Union tomorrow rather than the day after. But we cannot yet integrate Turkey too. And as regards identity, as this is an argument which keeps being brought into play, I think that if Turkey is European, then Ukraine and Russia, at least, should first belong to the European Union, and that is impossible too. But it is equally impossible to integrate Turkey. We should dismiss this thought. We should not string Turkey along any longer. It is just unfair and thoughtless. It is not we but our children who will have to pay the price.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are considering a regulation which expires at the end of the year. The role of this report is to provide a successor. We want to continue with the existing and worthwhile provisions in 2004-06, and in order for the legal basis to allow a seamless transition we want to try to succeed on the first reading, together with the Council and the Commission. We seem to have been successful so far, in that all the amendments proposed today are, on the whole, very worthy of support. We have sought to put the emphasis on the initiatives and stakeholders in the decentralised cooperation in the developing countries themselves rather than those in the European Union. The wording of Amendment No 10 is now the result of a compromise proposed by Mr Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and myself, and now states, among other things, that independent establishments are also included. We have adopted the wording used in Recital 11 on the status of churches and ideological groups in the Annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure that the ministers could accept it without any difficulties. The Commissioner has already said that Amendment No 5 is the real sticking point. Everything else has also been agreed in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. Amendment No 5 provides for an increase from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million. I have to say that while obviously I would like to see such an increase, given the current situation I do not think this report and the new regulation are the appropriate place for demanding one. It would undoubtedly mean – as the Council has made very clear – that no solution would be agreed at first reading. For that reason, I would prefer to stick with the EUR 18 million, as per the proposal, and then set a higher figure in the new negotiations for 2007 onwards.

 Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for this really excellent report. This House welcomes the Commission communication and urges the Commission and the Member States to make their contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water, especially given that around three million people die every year from water-borne diseases. If we look at the Commission’s ambitious goals, they deserve Parliament’s full and unequivocal support. The EU has undertaken to reach the development aid target of 0.39% of GDP on average for all EU Member States by 2006. At the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in March 2002, it was agreed that each of the current EU Member States would by 2006 increase the proportion of GDP spent on development to at least 0.33%. Yet taking the Federal Republic of Germany as an example, we can see that unfortunately, this is likely to remain a utopian ideal. Germany vigorously rejected, to the very last, any increase in spending, claiming that this was incompatible with budget discipline. This shows that ultimately, the Federal Government’s economic policy failures are the cause of inadequate development assistance. Only yesterday, I saw that the German Minister of Development states on her website that 0.27% of GDP is currently allocated to development assistance. This must seem like pure mockery to the people affected, who followed what happened at the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen as long ago as 1995 and trusted the pledge that 0.7% of GDP would be spent on official development assistance. The only conclusion we can draw is that it is hard luck for anyone who relies on development pledges! It is a sign of political bankruptcy – indeed, it is a political debtor’s oath – that at the same time, real expenditure has decreased by more than 500 million euros from 1990 to 2001. Yet we live in an era when Volkswagen, for example, has to appoint three apprentices to every training place in the developing countries because two out of three die during training, either from Aids or from other – water-borne – diseases. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in Monterrey, and I quote with your permission, Mr President, ‘If the industrialized countries do not double development assistance, the forces of envy, despair and terror will continue to grow’. Let me add to this: these forces will impact on Europe too. That, not least, must be avoided!

 Mr President, although we welcome the Commission communication, I regret that it does not adequately reflect the fundamental principle – stated in Cotonou – of participation by non-state actors (NSAs). Support from the Commission for non-state actors must be ensured, especially in countries where such support is not provided by government agencies. In doing this, those NSA projects that already have a successful track record should, in the interests of continuity, remain under NSA management, thus averting any risk that EU funding will trickle away into government structures. It has long been undisputed in the EU that civil society is an important pillar of its social development. The contributions made by civil society during the European Convention’s negotiations on an EU constitution are a recent example of this. Yet the increasingly robust civil society in the ACP states had no chance of participating in the negotiations on the current Cotonou Agreement. This, in my view, is where the Commission wasted an opportunity. The German Development Minister condescended to hold a joint press conference with a number of NGOs at the time, but she failed to give adequate support to civil society’s direct participation in the negotiations. Of course, there are still some developing countries that deal with aid funds in a fairly arbitrary way. That is the flip-side of the developing countries’ greater individual responsibility for the formulation of development policy, which is what we are seeking to achieve. Nonetheless, part of the balance can undoubtedly be restored by a strong civil society in the countries concerned. It is hardly surprising that most governments in the ACP countries reject such demands. For many ACP governments, non-state actors are still synonymous with opposition. It is even more important, therefore, for the Commission to take this step in the right direction at last.

 The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance, but whether the Czech Republic is founded upon the European order is a matter of doubt. Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts. This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.' It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that ‘ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture’. This is an unambiguous verdict. It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain. Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the ‘events full of violence and human tragedies’, which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were ‘unacceptable acts from today's point of view’, nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it. They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture. This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so.

 Madam President, I think this directive will be a success. What we have here is a classic example of European work. First of all, Parliament came up with a pioneering proposal as regards which the Council then needed four years to establish a common position adopted by the 15 Member States which was characterised by exclusively national interests. Parliament then required the Council to think in European terms at second reading, while the optimum demands were made on behalf of artists and auction houses. Finally, a solution that everyone involved considered to be acceptable and satisfactory was found following tough negotiations with the Council and the Commission. We have put European competition in the art market back on track, while auction houses and galleries in the EU are being given equality of opportunity. In this context, I think it is particularly important for the Commission to also look regularly into the issue of whether – and, if so, when – the European art market, and not only national art markets, are affected, and that corresponding adjustments are made. We have improved social security for artists and their heirs, who have now also been uniformly guaranteed a financial stake in the increases in value of their works. I therefore believe that we have, in this way, taken a first important step in the direction of more competition and more security in European art circles. I must ask the House to approve the result of the negotiations.

Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to refer to the remarks made by the Commissioner at 0.15 this morning and to point out that Amendment No 1 imposes an obligation of the Commission. I am pleased that Mr Fischler has accepted this amendment, in which the Commission is called upon to open international negotiations so that this droit de suite 
applies not only within the European Union but in as many countries of the world as possible. In this context, the amendment refers to Article 14 of the Berne Convention. In other words, Europe could play an exemplary role in this domain.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is considering at second reading the harmonisation of artists' right of resale, thus taking up again a directive for the benefit of artists as also galleries and auction houses in Europe that has been under discussion since 1996. First I want to thank those colleagues who have assisted with this project. It was very difficult to resolve the problems in a way that was useful for those concerned. In the end we did manage to do so thanks to the goodwill of all the groups in this House, as shown in particular by the decision in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I owe special thanks to Mr Dehousse and Mr Echerer, whose many discussions helped bring about workable compromises. Right of resale is the unassignable and inalienable right of creative artists to receive a share of the profits made from the selling on of their works. As such it forms part of societal copyright protection and is the expression of the societal acknowledgement of artistic creativity. It needs to be harmonised because although it already applies in many EU states, it has not so far been recognised in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland or Austria. That leads to considerable distortions of competition because it means that in one country an artist profits from the resale, whereas in another he gets nothing. That is not acceptable in the European market and is contrary to the requirements of the single market. The report proposes the following specific amendments to the Council's common position. Right of resale should extend to the professional trade in works of art. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes graduating the amount of royalties to be paid by the seller on the basis of a percentage rate of 4% for the portion of the sale price up to EUR 50 000 and 1% for the portion above EUR 200 000. Moreover, the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years, which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales. So here we must not allow a collective management firm to be involved. The new minimum sale price of EUR 1 000 repeats a proposal the European Parliament made at first reading. Most transactions in Europe take place up to the threshold sale price of EUR 4 000 provided for in the Council's common position, so that this area needs to be harmonised now. For amounts below EUR 1 000, however, there is no need for harmonisation since this does not affect the European market and on the basis of subsidiarity no European right of resale should apply. Furthermore, we have deleted the Council's proposed ceiling of EUR 12 500 as the highest amount of royalties an artist may receive, since there is no reason why successful artists should be penalised. In regard to the time limits for implementing this directive, on my proposal the committee decided to set a deadline of two years for each Member State to transpose it into its national law and during which the rights of the successor in title must be enforced in countries that have not hitherto recognised the right of resale. The time limits of five and ten years wanted by the Council and in particular by the United Kingdom are unacceptable because in effect this would simply enshrine the status quo and would only benefit the art market in the United Kingdom. The reservations voiced in several quarters can be summarised in two major groups. On the one side, UK lobbyists fear job losses. However, I do not see any risk of art markets relocating to Switzerland or the USA, since the insurance and transport costs exceed the costs involved in the right of resale and make it unprofitable to relocate. In addition, it is in the interests of both Switzerland and the USA to introduce a right of resale once we have adopted a harmonised right of resale in Europe. The second problem concerns Austria, where groups of artists have formed who fear the directive will have adverse effects and therefore oppose it. This is based on the quite mistaken assumption that it is compulsory to involve collective management firms, as has hitherto been the case in Austria. But that is precisely what the directive does not provide. Accordingly, this matter should be put before the Austrian legislator instead of attacking the European legislator who is only creating positive framework conditions for artists and auction houses. So I hope our UK colleagues will not show the same national tendency to block progress that we saw in Nice but that this Parliament will adopt a forward-looking European directive on the art market.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a very sad subject today. I am sure we are all at least in agreement that anti-personnel mines should be outlawed worldwide. I would like to subdivide this topic into three major areas. The first area is that of prevention. I am sure we in this Chamber agree that existing mines, and especially anti-personnel mines, must be destroyed. When I think of the problems and the events in developing countries, such as those in the ACP area or in Central America, it is evident that things cannot continue like this. Another point I regard as vital is that we need to tackle the black market, especially in Africa. The second important area for me is follow-up action. In this area we have to pay special attention to de-mining programmes and humanitarian actions. In particular, research initiatives in this area need to be supported, especially those concerned with technology for detecting and clearing mines. However, nor should we ignore the fact that the European Union, and in particular the European Parliament, is increasingly in a position to check more effectively where the money we intend for this purpose is actually going. The third area I have in mind concerns specific measures that ought to be proposed, examined and implemented. I believe that we should pay special attention to the victims of mines. These are, for the most part, private individuals, civilians, children and child soldiers – another topic that we have already discussed. With regard to children who have been mutilated in this way and therefore need long-term care, there is now the possibility of providing "growing" prostheses, which in Europe ...

 Mr President, I should first like to salute Mr Imbeni, the author of this report, and express my appreciation of his work. It is an excellent report which both identifies the main points of criticism and describes ways to ensure that ECHO is able to work effectively in the future. We have had this office for humanitarian aid in the EU since 1992, and both evaluation reports – which form the main basis of the assessment, together with the Commission's report – contain high praise for ECHO in respect of its work so far, while identifying several very serious weak points. Although the assessment of ECHO's work in terms of efficiency compared with costs, is very positive, there still remains the problem of the infamous ‘grey area’ in the time immediately following the events which trigger the provision of relief. Humanitarian operations in this ‘grey area’ cannot be assessed on the basis of precise criteria, nor do they provide the information and recommendations required for future ECHO operations in the area. It is therefore necessary, in my opinion, to improve disaster preparedness and step up the provision of disaster relief as a priority. It should be noted here that the regional approach adopted by the existing DIPECHO instrument offers a possible solution. At the same time, however, the lack of sufficiently flexible alternative instruments within the Commission is to be lamented. The Commission needs to present a clear strategy for the role which the humanitarian aid provided by ECHO has to play as part of foreign and development policy. ECHO does not have the necessary human resources to do the job of a planning headquarters. Staffing levels are below those characteristic of other Commission departments and well below those in national administrations, which are known to invest considerably less in crisis prevention. Here the appropriations, which currently stand at around EUR 7.5 million, therefore need to be at least – wait for it – quadrupled to allow the work to be done effectively. It is particularly regrettable – and Mr Imbeni has already made this point as well – that when projects are developed and run through partners, around 56% of which are non-governmental organisations, they are not identified strongly enough in the public arena as European Union aid. I believe that there is a considerable need for action here in the future. The public has to be informed, but please not with the funds which are directly available to ECHO. We should continue to pursue the positive initiatives here and use alternative sources of funding to defray the costs of informing the public.

Mr President, yesterday we received a communication on yellow paper from the vice-president, with some nuts attached to it. This note was about supporting the export of products from Vanuatu, a developing country in the Pacific. I think that is a very good idea and quite right. And I am quite happy to support it. But what rather puzzles me is that in it the vice-president quite explicitly stated that it is illegal to import these nuts into the European Union. So I must ask this vice-president to explain how these nuts came to be illegally imported, since it was he who delivered them to us! That in itself is a contradiction so would he please clarify the matter. (Laughter and applause)

 Mr President, I should like to return once again to the fax, which Mr Van Hulten made available to all of us before the vote, and which concerns the issue of whether sittings should continue to be held on Fridays. This is not just about participating in plenary sittings; there are other tasks which need to be dealt with in this regard as well. We will now have to deal with these matters at home. There are, however, no attendance allowances for working at home. But since we have been promised these allowances in Mr Van Hulten’s letter, in the coming year I will be claiming the lost allowances from him. (Applause)

Mr President, the EU/Africa summit was reported in the press under the headline: Kiss and make up! Unfortunately a unique opportunity to reconcile different ways of looking at current problems and find a solution was wasted. First, it is astonishing and highly unsatisfactory that the European Parliament was not included in this allegedly forward-looking conference. The members of the European Council appear to have overlooked the fact here that the people of Europe are represented first and foremost by this Parliament. Obviously no one was particularly interested in apprising the African states of this fact. So it was certainly not a mobilisation summit, as the press described it. As far as the content was concerned, it is perfectly understandable that the developing countries are interested in seeing their debt burden wiped out, but there can be no question of complete remission with no conditions attached. We found out at the last meeting of our ACP/EU assembly in Abuja that in Nigeria, for example, which has restored democracy, one of the last dictators diverted several billion euros to private accounts. One can only emphatically advise the developing countries to prosecute these offences, which are also punishable in Africa, and confiscate the money. Then some, and it is a great deal, of the money would again be available to repay debts. We would be able to recognise the good intentions of the developing countries and could then negotiate writing off and ignoring the rest of their debts. In my view, this is all part and parcel of the good governance to which the countries of Africa have committed themselves if they are to receive more development aid. On the other hand, I totally fail to understand why the German chancellor, for example, is treading a path which goes in the opposite direction of the other EU countries, by saying that the poorest of the poor countries should have all their debts written off first. This rather flashy and, in fact insubstantial gesture contradicts the resolutions of the G8 summit last year and is in keeping with his departure from the conference. It does not help matters if, instead of attending working meetings, one prefers to talk to Gadaffi for 10 minutes. What the topic of conversation was, one may only speculate. The chancellor of the media, as he is called at home, made his entrance and what came out of the final declaration adopted hours later was obviously a matter of indifference to him. This is not the way, in my view, to formulate development policy nor is it the way to bring about the urgently needed reconciliation of national development policies. I think that we, the European Parliament, must continue to denounce these national solo efforts and increase the responsibility of Member States’ governments. (Applause)

Mr President, last night, we were faced with the unwelcome news on EDF (German TV channel) that Mr Hombach, the EU Balkans Envoy, has been placed under investigation again by the Public Prosecutor. We have already had serious problems of this kind to contend with, as has the previous Commission, but in this particular case the accusation has been levelled that DM 300 000 were allegedly paid to an agency with nothing being received in return. I call upon you to inform the Council of this and to urge it to relieve Mr Hombach of all his duties until such time as this investigation has been resolved in a conclusive and legally valid manner. We cannot afford for the European Union to make a bad impression again.

 Mr President, this is a particularly important regulation given that it can no longer be said that ‘we are destroying the environment’ – we have done this for long enough already – instead it is now almost true to say that ‘the environment is destroying us’! It is now our task to counteract this. In the industrialised countries, significant initiatives are being taken to preserve and protect the environment. In the developing countries, however, intensive work still needs to be done on designing appropriate policies, strategies and projects to prevent further destruction and to care for the environment. Measures need to be implemented which, for instance, take account of the consequences of developing countries being integrated into the global economy. Nigeria can once again serve as an example here, as oil drilling there is causing commensurate environmental damage. Here too, education and training measures need to be supported in order, in the end, to help people to help themselves. The content of the regulation must therefore be supported in full, although the budget proposed by the Council is not sufficient by far. That is why I should like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour, in particular, of Amendment No 11, so that at least reasonable financial provision is made, even if this falls well below the amount for previous initiatives and is still only around EUR 13 million a year. Even at this early stage a considerable increase needs to be considered for when the Treaty or the regulation is revised.

 Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report. Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty. But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU. With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation. In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively. An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future. For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation. I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help. An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers. One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately. It will be easier to take account of the developing countries’ very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.

Mr President, I too should like to make a complaint. I have been trying to make a point of order for the last ten minutes. It is not right of you to lump all of us sitting up here in the last two rows together and to refuse to acknowledge points of order. I wanted to point out that the German translation was, unfortunately, lost in the commotion. It makes no sense to turn the public address system in the House up so loud that we can no longer hear anything over our headphones. That is my first point. On my second point, I should like to ask that the seating arrangements be changed in future. If you look at the seating plan, you will see that the four members of the PPE group up here in the last two rows are sitting between other groups. It is not a very happy arrangement and it should be changed, especially in view of what has happened here today.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Brok very warmly for his astute and very balanced report. I am glad of one thing that he makes clear in it, namely that it is not enough for us to produce a European security strategy as a constructive response to that of the United States; on the contrary, we must also show how it is to be achieved. That is why we need a two-stage plan of the kind proposed in the Brok report, with, as its first step, the formation of a European crisis intervention force for evacuation operations and humanitarian tasks. What worries us at present is our relationship with the United States and especially their reaction to these proposals and to those made by the Convention, which has put forward the idea of a mutual defence commitment for the countries of Europe. This causes concern to the United States, which take a critical attitude towards it, as they do – vehemently – towards the proposal for enhanced cooperation between a number of European countries. Then the proposal was made for a European armaments agency to combine our capacities, and our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic objected to that. There is one thing that we have to make clear here: on the one hand, our friends demand that we should develop our capacities and abilities to play a greater global security role and to make our contribution in this area. If we want to do that, we have to combine our capacities, and that, after all, is what these proposals are all about. We must, then, be clear in our own minds, and make it clear to the Americans, that if we combine our capacities in Europe, that is not being done only for Europe’s benefit, but also for that of the United States.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the High Representative has just talked about the dreadful and ongoing death toll in this territory between Israel and the Palestinians. We in the European Community must consider what contribution we can make to ensuring that, in the long term, peace is restored to this tormented territory. The question is this: What contribution can the European Community make? Indeed, is the European Community powerful enough to make an effective contribution here? The European Community is certainly powerful in the economic field, and its economic contribution to stabilising this territory in the past undoubtedly outstrips the contribution made by others in the same way. Yet on the other hand, when it comes to taking final decisions and to providing final guarantees to one side or the other that its people can live in peace and security in this territory in the long term, the European Community in its present state is obviously still too weak to make this vital contribution. That is why I too have a question for the High Representative, who is working with great commitment in this region: What role does this territory play in the European Union’s security strategy, which is currently being drafted? I am aware, Mr Solana, that your staff are working very intensively on this security strategy. This security strategy also involves the circle of friends with which the European Community is surrounding itself, and so my question is this: how much priority will be given to this particular conflict within that framework, and in developing this circle of friends, will the dreadful conflict which we are discussing here today be given adequate priority?

 Mr President, first of all we should ask ourselves why we are debating issues to do with European defence in this Chamber, which is not particularly full, in the European Parliament. I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Barnier is here, because he was the one who brought the issue of European defence to the fore in the Convention. Right at the outset, I should like to explain briefly why we are addressing defence issues here in this Parliament. In 1999, the Heads of State and Government decided to establish a European crisis intervention force of between 50 000 and 60 000 troops. Since then, this crisis intervention force, which was actually a virtual force and not a regular European Union army, has however been deployed in two cases, first in a small operation in Macedonia, and then also in Bunia in the Congo under mainly French leadership. I come now to the European Parliament: on 10 April of this year, on the basis of the Morillon report, the European Parliament set out its views on defence policy, and in particular proposed a two-stage plan. At the time we had asked ourselves what we could learn from Maastricht. We learnt from Maastricht that first and foremost you only make progress in Europe if you set clear goals and deadlines for achieving them. We said that by the year 2009 we wanted to have made sufficient progress to be capable of carrying out an operation of the intensity and difficulty of the Kosovo conflict on our own, independently, or together with our allies. As a first step, the call was made in the Morillon report, and subsequently endorsed by a substantial majority in the European Parliament, for us to have a 50 000-strong crisis intervention force by 2004, a permanent crisis intervention force to be available around the clock for rescue operations and humanitarian duties. That then is what the European Parliament is calling for. I now turn, however, to arms policy: after the operations in the Balkans, we were told repeatedly by the American side that Europe only spent 50% of what the Americans spend on defence, but that measured in terms of efficiency it was only 10%. Why is that the case? In the United States there is only one buyer of arms and that is the Pentagon. In the European Union, there are not one but 15 buyers, which procure more or less the same things, but according to different criteria and using different methods, and cooperation in this sector leaves a great deal to be desired. We do not therefore have a common armaments market here, but continue to have 15 sub-markets. Our goal now must be – if we wish to move forward and spend European taxpayers' money more efficiently in this sector – actually to form a common market, which means dismantling barriers to trade between the Member States in this sector too. However, if we wish to dismantle these barriers to trade, we first need to ensure not only that there are common rules for the export of armaments, but also that these common rules are applied in the same way by the 15 Member States. Anything else would mean that the exports would first be transferred within the European Union to those countries with the laxest provisions, and that must not be allowed to happen. The European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is undoubtedly our most developed body of legislation. But firstly it is only a code and it has only been transposed into law in some countries. The first demand that is made in my report is for this code to be made legally binding. That is the first issue. Member States may also declare unilaterally that the provisions are legally binding. In addition, we have to ensure, as soon as they are legally binding, that the authorities in the 15 Member States apply these provisions in exactly the same way, because that is the first and most important precondition for success. Secondly, the report calls for arms brokering to be better regulated. There is a certain element here of deals taking place in a grey area, brokered by people who should surely not be involved in this activity. That is why we are calling for all of those engaged in brokering activities to be registered, and think that a Europe-wide system of authorisation should be introduced for this activity. Thirdly, we note that it is relatively straightforward to ascertain who has manufactured the arms, and often this also tells you who owns them. It is unclear, however, how they are passed from one to the other. That is why we are calling for an international system to be set up that will make it possible to ascertain who has passed the arms to the end-users. There is a French proposal on this subject and we are calling for this to be used as a basis for ensuring that we obtain a full account of how the arms reach end-users, which is of decisive importance for security.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the statement issued by the Thessaloniki Summit on the European Union's security policy was an important step towards a common European Security and Defence Policy. The United States have set out their security policy in clear terms, and it guides their actions on a day-to-day basis. A constructive response to it from the European Union is overdue and necessary. The paper tabled here is the beginning of a joint reply of this kind. If we take a closer look at it, we see that when it comes to analysing new threats in the world, joint statements are made that are extremely detailed and also completely accurate. But when it comes to defining the answers to them and saying what now needs to be done, we see that the system of unanimity makes it extremely difficult to come up with a coherent statement. That is why this paper can only be a beginning, a beginning with important statements. Nevertheless, we need a broad debate about this in the European Union, including in Parliament, so as to gradually formulate a common security strategy. We need clearer statements on our relations with NATO, on our relations with the United Nations, and on the roles that Russia and also Turkey will play in this security concept, and we need a clearer mandate – this too is addressed to the Intergovernmental Conference – for the arms agency that is now being proposed. Above all, however, we need a step-by-step plan. We have seen that the European Union has only ever carried out projects successfully when it has first had a plan setting out clear tasks and deadlines. Our job now is to formulate a more precise strategy of this kind for the European Union.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo Mr Goebbels' thanks to the Greek Presidency and to Mr Yiannitsis in particular for their cooperation during this presidency, which has been outstanding and inspires confidence. I would like to mention a few issues regarding foreign policy in the Convention. The new document presented to us here defines the objectives of the European Union's foreign policy. It goes without saying that we wish to use our foreign policy to promote human rights, democracy and environmental protection. But there is one thing that is rather skimmed over here. For me, it is self-evident that the first and most important objective of the European Union must be the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in other words effectively representing the interests of the EU's citizens and the interests of the European Union itself on the world stage, and in particular our citizens' desire to live in peace and security. There are some things in this field that should not be allowed to happen again. We as the European Union should not be left without a voice, as happened on Iraq. Hence our demand that we should introduce majority voting in this area, because only in that way can the European Union act effectively in the field of foreign policy. What we also need is an EU security strategy as a counterpart to the security strategy published by the American administration in September last year. We as Europeans need to adopt a clear position on a number of issues here – first the United States' claim to leadership and second the statements made here about a preventive war. We know that Mr Solana has been charged with the task of presenting a proposal to the Heads of State and Government for Thessaloniki. However, that can only be a first step in this debate. The debate needs to be an open one and it needs to be held in the European Parliament, because we Europeans must, on the basis of a wide-ranging debate, reach a common position on these important issues. We have to ask ourselves what the position on a division of labour with the United States is. Do we want a situation in which we leave military intervention to the United States, with Europe looking after the financial mopping up, as people sometimes call it? Or do we want to agree that Europe should play a regional role here, for example the task of guaranteeing peace and security in its own geographical region? These are important and vital decisions in which Parliament, too, should be involved. Above all, we Europeans should make it clear that the EUR 160 billion spent by the 15 EU Member States on defence need to be spent more efficiently in future, and if we want to be up there with the United States we will also need to spend more money, hard though that may be! Now, what is Parliament's role in all this? For example, the Military Committee in Brussels is discussing intervention in the Congo. That should not happen without Parliament being consulted. We should be kept informed about that; we should have an opportunity to deliver an opinion on it. If war and peace are at stake, things like this cannot be decided without consulting a directly elected parliament, and in this case that is this House. As a consequence this House needs to adopt an opinion on this important subject at the very least next week and beyond that, because careful consideration is needed as to whether with its present organisation the European Union is in a position to take on such a role.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Morillon on his excellent report. His ability to achieve very broad consensus in this House on this extremely important issue is demonstrated not only by this debate, but also by the relatively few amendments that have been tabled. Comparing that with the situation in similar debates as recently as five years ago, we see that there is today in this House very broad consensus on the need for a European defence contribution. On that I congratulate Mr Morillon. His report is an important building block in the development of a security strategy for the European Union. Why is that necessary? We took note last September of the United States' new security strategy. Week in and week out, we are at present seeing how systematically the United States implements it. What we Europeans need is a European security strategy to be a response to that. We Europeans need, as the first building block in our common foreign policy, to start by together defining what our security interests are. I believe this to be perfectly possible. Firstly, there is broad consensus about the European Union's ability, within the NATO framework, to defend itself against any conceivable aggressor, whether this be done together with our allies, or, if need be, independently. I would very much welcome a decision by the Convention to propose a mutual support clause for the new constitution of the European Union. We should, secondly, be developing our capacities, so we still need time to make necessary contributions to crisis management in the area around the European Union, which must be both civil and military. That is not yet the case today, and we have not yet been able to do that independently, but it is a capacity that we must develop. Thirdly, we in the European Union should be in a position to carry out rescue operations anywhere in the world and at any time, where the safety of European citizens is involved. Those are three more building blocks towards a security strategy for the European Union. If we develop one, we must take into account the experiences we have had of comparable major projects, such as the internal market or the European currency. These were successful only because we had specific requirements on content and time, because we were clear about what we want to do and when we wanted to be able to do it. The Morillon Report deals with this issue in a number of ways. What the public expects of the European Union is peace, security and stability. We in the European Parliament must do our bit to ensure that the European Union does, as a whole, live up to these expectations.

 Mr President, I wish to point out one remarkable characteristic of the vote that is currently in progress. With effect from 1 April the European Union will be taking over from NATO responsibility for peacekeeping in Macedonia. This will be the first military operation to be conducted under European Union leadership. I would like to point out that the issue of democratic control is of even greater importance in this instance than in others; that the mandate of a parliament – specifically of this European Parliament – is required; and that this principle, whereby similar operations have to be subject to democratic control, has to be embodied in the future European Constitution.
von Wogau (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my own group, too, I would like to express our profound sense of bewilderment at the death of Mr Djindjić and to take this opportunity to say that events such as these always forcefully bring us back to the question of whether the establishment of peace in this region really has advanced as far as we hoped it had. Apart from that, Mr Gollnisch, I take the view that our taking over from NATO responsibility for the mission in Macedonia is an historic event. Even though the unit involved is a very small one, this still creates a precedent, in that structures and possibilities are being created on which we will later be able to build. It is for that reason that I believe this to be an important step on the road that leads to a European defence policy. For the first time, the EU is taking on responsibility for the military side of peacekeeping in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. What functions do parliaments have to perform in operations of this kind? It is one of the principles of democratic politics that military operations may be mounted only with the mandate of a directly elected parliament. For Macedonia, these mandates were provided by the national parliaments. If European defence policy is to develop further, mandates will in future have to be given by the European Parliament, and so, our primary expectation of the Council is that it should do what has already been demanded of it and, this very day, meet this need by providing truly comprehensive information and, secondly, we expect the Convention to give parliamentary control a clear, unambiguous and permanent place in the future constitutional treaty. Those in positions of political leadership must ensure that the troops on the ground are not exposed to unnecessary dangers – and what gives rise to these? They come about as a result of the wrong orders being given or of inadequate leadership and equipment. This consideration leads me to put a number of questions to the Council, and also to the Commission. For a start, what difference will it make that American troops are no longer to be deployed in Macedonia? Might not the loss of certain capacities expose our soldiers to danger? My second question concerns the way in which decisions are implemented. Are you confident that the decisions taken by the Council will then be implemented by way of NATO, and that, when decisions have to be implemented without delay on the ground, these lines of command really do function as quickly as will be required of them? Thirdly, I turn to costs, on which I have questions about both the civilian and military sides of this mission. It is my view that both the Convention and the new constitutional treaty will, in future, have to make it possible for the military costs of the mission, as well as the civilian ones, to be borne by the Budget of the European Union. I would like to conclude by saying that we have seen in this morning's debate on Iraq just how inadequate the European Union's foreign and security policy can still be at the present time, but, at the same time, I would like to give voice to the hope that, at any rate in the European Union's immediate vicinity, where the essence and heart of Europe – of which the Balkans are part – are at stake, we may continue to demonstrate the European Union's capacity to contribute to the maintenance of peace.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing the Budget and the strategy for 2004. As has been said, 2004 will be the year of the European Union's enlargement, but it must also be a year in which, at last, the European Union's foreign and security policy is developed further. So the crucial question is what democratic control there will be when we get a common defence policy. In this area, democratic control is exercised primarily by way of the Budget procedure. If we are to have to handle issues of war and peace in the same way as issues of foreign and security policy, such democratic control is even more important than in other areas. It is in view of the Convention that we need to make certain demands now, demands that will be significant in 2004. For a start, we have to ensure that the military element of operational expenditure on peacekeeping and crisis management has a fixed place in the European Union's regular Budget and that we in Parliament get full powers of codecision. Secondly, President Prodi, you said that joint actions were being undertaken in the European Union in the area of research and development, and in the purchase of armaments. We know that the Convention is talking in terms of an armaments agency, and we must do all in our power to ensure that these Budget lines do not disappear into a shadow budget somewhere, a budget over which neither the European Parliament nor the twenty-five national parliaments will have any control, but rather that these items of expenditure are reflected in the regular Budget of the European Union.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr President of the Council, concluded your remarks with a brief discussion of European defence policy. You observed that the agreement between NATO and the European Union has now come into being, thus leaving the way open for the next European defence policy measures, which we can expect to be taken in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is an eventuality to which particular attention must be drawn, as the European Union will then, for the first time, be taking on responsibilities in defence in a visible way. This leads me to put two questions, the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future. Do you share the view that the constitutional treaty currently under negotiation should include an article stipulating a mutual defence commitment, comparable to the corresponding article in the treaty on the Western European Union? That would be an expression of confidence when we take joint action. Secondly, you also, very briefly, addressed the area of armaments policy, alluding to the way in which the countries of the European Union spend EUR 150 billion on defence, whereas we are always being told that the excessive duplication resulting from this means that efficiency is minimal. Do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created? What definite steps will the Greeks take during their presidency of the Council? (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's Kangaroo Group has made an essential contribution to making the European internal market a reality. Many of the Members speaking today belong to the Kangaroo Group. It is this group that is today presenting you with an initiative demanding the further development of the internal market as it is today into a true European home market. Over recent months, we have had talks with a large number of people in the business world in order to analyse where we have got to, what progress we have made in making the European internal market a reality, and it is the results of these that we are presenting to you today. For a start, the European internal market is a success story. A fundamental change occurred in the realities in Europe when the borders between the countries belonging to the European Community were thrown open. Standardised entry requirements then made European firms substantially more competitive, and the creation of new instruments, among which I will mention only the European Patent Office, makes it very much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to gain access to the European market. We have, though, at the same time discovered that there are many areas in which no internal market exists, where we have fifteen domestic markets within a European internal market that does not really work. We all know, for a start, that this is true in financial services. It is the case in the life sciences, pharmaceuticals and other areas in which there is no internal market either, and it is true in the defence field, where the first hesitant moves are being made towards the creation of common policy and a common internal market. Last but not least, the leap from internal market to domestic market demands of us – and I say this also for Mr Harbour's benefit – that we should have a common European currency in all the countries of the European Union, and this development also requires us to work on the basis of a common economic model. This must, in my view, be that of the social market economy. We now call on the Commission to come up with a coherent concept for introducing this new stage in the development of the European home market.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with a prefatory remark in order to highlight the climate in which we are engaging in debate. The countries belonging to the European Community have at present a mountain of debt totalling EUR 4 700 billion. What that means is that, taken together, the countries belonging to the European Community owe EUR 4 700 billion. The annual interest payments alone, by which this debt is serviced, amount to EUR 230 billion per annum – more than double the European Union's Budget. I am sure that you, Mr President of the Commission, will agree with me when I say that it would be stupid and idiotic to open these floodgates even wider at the present time. I will now turn to the Stability and Growth Pact, for which we have framed rules that are very clear. With the objective of balancing budgets, the deficit may not exceed 3%, and sanctions become operative if this 3% rule is not adhered to. That is the point at issue, and that is what we have to deal with now. It was an enormous help to your country's budget, at the time you were at the head of its government, that these rules create confidence. This confidence led to lower interest rates, and that took a great deal of pressure off your budget. My second point is that I believe it really would be stupid to gamble away these advantages now. Mr President of the Commission, you said that there is a need in Europe for an authority that would have an undisputed role of economic governance. You may not have used those words, but what you meant is a European economic government. That is a view that I share. In my view, that can only be the Commission. What is required of such an economic government, though, is that it should lay down rules and see to it that they are adhered to, in order that they may send out the right messages. Mr President of the Commission, by your interview with Le Monde,
 you sent the wrong message. What we expect of you today is that you should make good that error and should do as Parliament demanded on 2 May 1997 and apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact – not flexibly, but strictly and consistently. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was possible, at the Helsinki Summit, to get the impression that we really were on the way to having a common European defence policy. The Heads of State or Government of the time set themselves ambitious objectives, and the early months made it possible to assume that these objectives would be achieved relatively speedily and within the time limits envisaged. Looking at matters today, when the deadline is fast approaching, we can see that we are far from achieving these objectives. The current proposal that NATO should deploy and build up a crisis intervention force makes it clear that our American friends have also lost confidence that we Europeans can actually reach the decisions that are required. This should prompt us to make new attempts along these lines, as this European crisis intervention force is, as I see it, an essential step towards securing peace around the European Union. Turning now to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, I would like to thank Mr Titley for his excellent report. We have common rules on arms exports, we have a common code and a code of conduct, but these rules are interpreted in different ways. We have just seen an export to one Member State prohibited, whilst the same goods were then allowed to be exported to another. This must not be allowed to happen in future; whilst we need common rules, the way in which they are applied must also be common to all. It will probably turn out that any code of conduct will be insufficient, and these rules will also have to be put on a legal footing. When talking about arms exports, we are on the way to a common market in the defence field as well. That is why I consider it important, if we are talking about shipping armaments within the European Union and the export rules unfortunately cease to be applied, for these shipments to be made easier. All 15 EU countries, after all, form a community of values composed of democratic states, and this leads me to believe that such a thing is possible, as are substantial savings, estimated by experts at EUR 240 billion per annum. I would like to conclude by pointing out how important democratic control is in this area. I would therefore like there to be even greater attention paid to this debate. If not only foreign policy, but also defence policy, are under discussion, then the matter at issue is war and peace, about which democratically elected parliaments alone can decide. At present, this burden rests primarily on the shoulders of our counterparts in the national parliaments, but, the more this European policy develops, the more this Parliament will also have to take upon itself this crucial task. (Applause)

 Mr President, I should like to say a few brief words about Mr Schulz's speech. That was not a question; it was a campaign speech! (Applause)
 I can only conclude that the opinion polls have obviously made him very nervous, and this was also an opportunity like no other! I should like to ask a question, Mr President-in-Office, about the division of competences during your presidency. Defence policy will be the responsibility not of Denmark but of Greece even during your presidency. We are, however, facing some very important decisions, particularly in the Balkans, for example concerning the American involvement there and the transfer of responsibility to the European Union. This raises the following question: how are you going to ensure optimal coordination between the civilian and military aspects of the operation, which are of course by their very nature inextricably linked? What role will the presidency play, and what part will be assigned to the Commission?

 Mr President, last night there was a terrible air crash when two aircraft collided over Überlingen near Lake Constance. There is, at present, speculation that some eighty people have been lost, including children who were on a holiday trip. I believe such an event calls for Parliament to express its sympathy to the families of the victims. It also, however, calls on us to consider how such an accident could occur in the first place, and to give thought to whether Europe's present fragmented system of air traffic control, involving military, national and European authorities, might not have been a contributory factor. Pilots report ever more frequently how complicated flying through European airspace has become. This terrible accident, this frightful calamity should prompt us now to really mean business with the European system of air traffic management that we have been calling for.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to join those who have congratulated Mr Lamassoure on his excellent report, and, if time permits, to take up three points in it. The first has to do with the subsidiarity principle and the monitoring of how it is adhered to. I would have liked us to have granted right of action to those regions that possess the right to enact legislation. 
I do not know whether we will find a majority in support of that, but I would think it right and proper, and a step in the right direction, to at least grant that right of action to the national Parliaments. Taking the review clause as my second point, I consider it of extraordinary importance that Mr Lamassoure makes it clear that this can work in both directions. I believe that future negotiations will depend on that to a very significant degree. Thirdly, the report refers to improvement of the legislative process, which must, for a start, involve the legislative function being, as Mr Lamassoure proposes, more clearly demarcated from the executive – and that includes the terminology used. It involves the EU's lawmaking being relieved of the burden of technical details. I would like to add that the agreements reached between the three institutions on the basis of the proposals in the financial services area are not yet adequate to deal with democratic control, but that they can at least serve to point the right way ahead.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that this debate today is also touching on industrial aspects of European defence policy. We should remind ourselves that the founding fathers of the European Union did not create it because they wanted economic cooperation, but because its prime task was to ensure peace, so that there was a plan for a European defence policy as far back as the period between 1952 and 1954. It is a good thing that we are picking up where we left off then. Commissioner Patten has presented us with a challenge. He has asked us this question: would we be willing to demand that 14% should be spent on defence, as is the case in the United States? However, I would first like to make another demand, and that is the demand that the money we are already spending on defence should be spent more sensibly, instead of having 15 different policies in this area. We need to take advantage of the synergy that can be achieved if we work together in this field. Part of this is that the rules of Europe's internal market need to be applied more in this field. There are some sensible exceptions here, but these exceptions are applied too widely, and we therefore need to make sure that these rules are applied more fully. For 15 different nations finally to work together implies a certain standardisation in this area, as otherwise there will be enormous problems of incompatibility. We have already developed standardisation procedures in the civilian world that could be helpful here, especially as regards dual use. Lastly, we should not lose sight of the fact that the most important pilot project in this field is the crisis management force agreed upon in Helsinki. The question is this: should the European Union actually take over the leading role in Macedonia in the foreseeable future? I believe that we need to consider that very carefully. We should not put the cart before the horse here. We should not let ourselves get into a situation in which we can be blackmailed by either side, because this first European intervention will be of the utmost importance for us.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an extraordinarily important debate that we are taking part in today. It is important to banks, insurance companies and investment funds, because this debate will make it clear that we are pressing onward – and that without delay – on the road that leads to a common European market in financial services. The debate is though, also important to the European Union's citizens, as we are removing obstacles from the path of cross-border competition in the field of financial services, in the granting of credits and the negotiation of insurance policies. Competition of this sort will put the citizen in a stronger position and enhance Europe's competitiveness. What, then, is this debate about? Alexandre Lamfalussy and his Committee of Wise Men have made proposals as to how we can speed up the great legislative package needed to make this common market in financial services a reality. In doing so, he made the wise suggestion that the legislator, that is Parliament and the Council, should focus on setting the essential objectives, whilst leaving to the Commission, working together with experts, the small print of the implementation provisions. That proposal is a very good one. Where, then, is the problem? The problem is that we have always found, in our experience as parliamentarians, that it is to us that the public and firms come with complaints about the European Union's bureaucracy, and that they are not complaining about the law, be it a directive or a regulation, that we have helped to enact, but about the provisions made for its implementation. That is why Parliament has insisted on being able, jointly with the Council, to carry out a kind of final check on whether the implementation provisions that are enacted actually correspond to what the legislator intended. What have our negotiations with the Commission and the Council now achieved? At this point, let me warmly thank President Prodi for his statement, but also Commissioner Bolkestein, Mr John Mogg and many others, as well as the secretariat of the Constitutional Committee. I have to tell you that the discussions lawyers had in this area occasionally reminded me of disputations in ancient Byzantium on the sex of angels. I wish to thank very warmly all those who helped me find my way judiciously through this labyrinth. What have we achieved? Transparency first of all. That is important, as we are informed about everything that goes on in the Commission. We also get to see preliminary drafts. Secondly, we have achieved the reduction of the mandate to four years, after which period it must be renewed by Parliament and the Council. We have, furthermore, gained the right to monitor outcomes, which is where President Prodi's statement was extraordinarily important. Like the Council, we have three months in which to do this, in which respect we are given equivalence with them. President Prodi, indeed, spoke of parity and equivalence, which adds up to an additional safeguard. Thirdly, we must be clear in our own minds about the actual relations between the powers. We are faced with a large number of legislative acts, which have to be adopted. Each time, Parliament and the Council together must give the Commission a mandate, and if the Commission were to fail to take Parliament's justified interests and objections into account in this respect, it would have cause to fear that it would not be granted that mandate when it came to the next legislative act. What this means is that, today in any case, we as a Parliament are in a very strong position in this context. To that extent I take the view that, in this context, or on the basis of President Prodi's statement, the equivalence we demanded has been granted. Something that strikes me as also especially important is the committee of market participants, which we decided on. This represents a first step towards the European Union's lawmaking becoming more modern. We must reach the situation in which legislation generally makes a clear distinction, as Alexandre Lamfalussy proposed, between the Parliament and the Council's intentions as joint legislators and the small print of the technical details. Here, for example, the supervisory authorities and the experts should be involved, but at the same time the market participants, too, should be included in the structures as purely practical issues are under discussion. In that sense I also believe that what we are deciding on today can also be a model for the Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference, and the improvement of the European Union's legislative procedure, and so I wish to ask you to adopt my report. (Applause)

Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your decision not to make a reference to the European Court of Justice, as the creation of the European Company was one of the objectives for this parliamentary session, and is one of the five decisions for which the economy has been waiting. For thirty years, this decision has been awaited; for thirty years, negotiations have been in progress. To go to the Court of Justice now would mean this business being dragged out for another five or six years; for I am convinced that no firm would avail itself of this important new form under such uncertain conditions. So I believe it wise in this case to refrain from making a reference to the European Court of Justice.

Mr President, I get the impression that there will be speakers only against the urgent procedure, something I consider a very important step. There is the danger that the Council will decide on its position before Parliament's has been produced. I consider it a matter of urgent necessity that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs should deliver its opinion first, and that only then should the Council come to a decision. It is for that reason that we should reject this request for urgent procedure.
von Wogau (PPE-DE

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this speech is the last I shall deliver in this Chamber as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I have been a member of this Committee for 22 years. From tomorrow, I shall be a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I am convinced that the next step on the road to the realisation of the European Union must be political union. I look forward to working on this task in future. Looking back over these years, I would like to start by recalling our colleague Basil de Ferranti, now sadly deceased, who at that time drafted the first reports on the creation of the internal market and thereby initiated this whole development. It started off as a working party on technical barriers to trade, later spawning the Kangaroo Group. These were the first initiatives towards creating the internal market. Jacques Delors was at that time the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in other words, Mrs Randzio-Plath, our predecessor; he then, as French Finance Minister and later as President of the European Commission, laid the foundations on which these ideas were to become realities. I wish also to recall Jacques Moreau who, together with me back then in 1984, presented the first report of the European Parliament on proposals for the creation of the internal market. Seeing the enthusiasm that greeted the euro on 1 January, welcoming this new currency for 300 million people in the European Union, we have to recall, on the one hand, how difficult was the road to this. On the other hand, though, we also have to ask ourselves what conditions are required for the euro, our common currency, to be successful in the long term? Let me here list three conditions. The first is the consistent development of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is indeed almost ironic that we see today that it was Germany, my homeland, that campaigned most vigorously then for this Stability and Growth Pact with its strict criteria, and that one can, or must, almost take it for granted in the present situation that Germany will be the first country to be affected by this treaty's sanctions. I take the view, though, that we must be consistent here if we want the euro to become and remain a stable currency in the long term and interest rates in the European Union to remain low in the long term for our enterprises, as a condition of investment and growth. The second condition is that, in the Member States and in the EU, we make economic policy in accordance with principles held in common. It was by a large majority the will of Parliament that these principles should be those of the social market economy. Thirdly, we must move forward to political union. We said before Maastricht that we wanted monetary union and political union at the same time. Even then we were saying that monetary union cannot exist in the long term without political union. We must stay consistent on this point. It is now that we must take these steps to political union, at the core of which is a common foreign and security policy. I would like, finally, to pick up on something Jacques Delors said. Jacques Delors, during the interminable debates we had on the European internal market, once remarked, and quite rightly, that you could not fall in love with an internal market. In other words, there is very little emotion involved. I would also say that the same applies to a currency, although there are some of us who have a very emotional, almost erotic, relationship with the currency. What we need, though, and what we must bring to light, is the awareness of a common European identity, Europe-consciousness. I believe that is surely the most important task facing us as the European Parliament. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, in our view, the Member States which have the primary task of creating the appropriate framework for more employment. It goes without saying that the European Union can contribute towards it. I believe, though, that dialogue between the ministers of the various Member States is particularly important here. On looking into the matter more closely, we note that we have in some countries of the European Union almost full employment, but in others unemployment – and, in particular, youth unemployment – on a frightening scale. I believe it to be a matter of extraordinary importance that the States should learn from one another and avoid making the mistakes already made by others. We can see that the countries that perform best have created jobs on the basis of a solid financial policy and have got to grips with the necessary structural reforms earlier than others. We must also ask ourselves the question: who, then, actually creates jobs? It is not the state, it is often not the major enterprises, which indeed tend rather to retrench. It is, far more, the small and medium-sized enterprises that create the most jobs. If we want to be successful, the establishment of new enterprises is especially important. It is a matter of creating the appropriate framework for them. We must make it our concern that the European Union is not the institution that contributes to life being even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises or to making it difficult to set up new ones. The European Union's activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why did my group demand this afternoon's debate on the Stability and Growth Pact? The reason given was that we were disturbed by certain utterances we have heard emanating from the ranks of socialist governments in the past weeks and months. The statements made by Mr Eichel, Mr Jospin, Mr Fabius, and other things that were said, all went along the same lines. For a start, they asserted that it was necessary in the present situation to soften the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. That was the first demand. The second was that the Heads of State and of Government must be accorded the right to prescribe annual stability objectives to the European Central Bank. We take the view that both these proposals are extraordinarily dangerous, for the Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are the twin pillars on which rests the European Union's monetary system. These pillars must not be shaken. My group will always speak up in favour of maintaining the independent European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact in their present forms. Let us turn now to the resolutions on the table before us. Jointly with the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, we have submitted a motion for a resolution. We negotiated with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which stated that it was unable to agree to our resolution. What, though, is so bad about our resolution? It states that the Stability and Growth Pact should, in quite simple words, be 'retained'. Why can they not agree to that? Then they said: We want to put its principles fully into practice. Why not just agree to it then? We need measures against money laundering. You spoke about that, Commissioner. We need measures to destroy the financial background for terrorist acts. Why not agree to that? We must also be consistent in reducing monopolies in order to strengthen the competitiveness of our European economy. Why can they not agree to that? Now for the second question: what counter-proposal does the other side have to offer? They put forward essentially the same ones over and over again: that the European Central Bank should cut interest rates. Or, on the other hand, that the Stability and Growth Pact, or the Member States' budget policies, should be relaxed. That is the Socialist policy mix. That is the potion concocted by druids to cure all the ills of our economy at a stroke and without effort. It would be nice if things worked like that, my dear Christa! But in reality they do not. Take a look at Japan, where this policy was applied and where it does not work. Consider the stock exchanges in the United States today, where it can be seen that it does not work. Look at economic history, where we see from the past that it has never yet worked. So I would like to urge you to reject these demands and support our resolution. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place at a difficult moment as regards economic policy. Growth is declining and inflation is on the increase. The Federal Republic of Germany, which accounts for a third of the euro area, is bringing up the rear in terms of growth, inflation and net government borrowing. It is no longer the locomotive it once was, it is now the last coach in the train. At this difficult time it is, above all, important for the European Central Bank, which is a young central bank, to gain credibility. For this reason we too will not be voting for three of the proposals made by the rapporteur in her report. The first proposal was that core inflation should be the key factor in economic decision making, that is to say inflation excluding energy and food. This would amount to looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles, because what matters to the public is not core inflation but inflation including energy and food prices. The second proposal that we will be rejecting is that of setting inflation targets. I am convinced that the European Central Bank was right to establish its own definition of stability shortly after it was set up, according to which monetary stability is an inflation rate of less than 2%. That cannot be altered now. If anything, it is precisely in the current difficult situation that the European Central Bank should be measured by its own yardstick. That is the reason why we cannot vote for this second proposal. The third proposal relates to the accession countries. The proposal that the accession countries should not in fact be required to meet the inflation criteria of the Maastricht Treaty in the same way, which would also mean a weakening of stability, is something else my Group will not agree to.

Mr President, to my very great surprise, I have learned this morning that a group of three Vice-Presidents has decided to assign the issue of services of public interest, which is incontestably a competition matter, to the Legal Affairs Committee. The Rules of Procedure state that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is responsible for competition matters. The proposal in question, concerning services of public interest, was even presented by Mario Monti, the Commissioner responsible for competition. Our rapporteur, Mr Langen, who has been working on this matter for several months and has now submitted a report, has just discovered to his astonishment that another committee is responsible. I wish to say quite clearly here that a group of three Vice-Presidents has no authority to overturn the Rules of Procedure. (Applause)
 For this reason, I ask that we proceed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and that the Conference of Presidents deal with this matter. Unfortunately, it is not the only current issue concerning the competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which is apparently being widened bit by bit. This question must be settled once and for all, and the Conference of Presidents is the body to settle it, for the present situation is obstructing the proper discharge of our parliamentary duties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first of January 2002 will mark the start of a momentous chapter in the history of European integration, when twelve sovereign states exchange their national currencies for a common European currency. From that moment on, the people of those twelve Member States will use the same notes and the same coins. It seems appropriate to find a term to describe this new stage in the integration of national economies, a stage which is characterised by a common market and a common currency and which is surely unique in the economic history of the world. We propose the use of the term ‘European home market’ as a synonym for Euroland or the euro zone. This European home market already has a common monetary policy. Since European economic and monetary union came into being on 1 January 1999, this policy has been in the hands of the European Central Bank. Today, however, we are faced with the challenge of formulating appropriate common economic policies for the European home market. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed by a clear majority that these economic policies should be based on the principle of a socially committed market economy. The main instrument for the coordination of economic policies at European level is the procedure laid down in the Treaty for establishing the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. The European Parliament has hitherto played a subordinate role in this procedure. I therefore believe it is absolutely essential to provide for a greater degree of participation by the European Parliament in future. Another flaw in the procedure is its lack of flexibility. Recommendations are made on the basis of predicted economic trends. If, however, current economic data diverge from the forecast values, these recommendations lose some of their validity. The Member States must therefore be given some leeway to respond quickly to unexpected changes in economic indicators. The Guidelines are not legally binding, but it is certainly accurate to speak of the political binding force of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Although there is no disputing that defects must be corrected in everyone’s interest, a certain margin of discretion should exist here too. I believe there is a need, for example, when assessing a Member State’s economic policies, to consider the extent to which particular trends in that country will affect the euro zone as a whole. Economic growth in the European Union has slowed down since last year. The Commission has now revised its predicted growth rate of 3% and has lowered its expectations to 2.8%. Other observers expect even lower growth rates. On the basis of these forecasts, we consider a figure of between 2 and 2.5% for this year to be entirely realistic. In view of the general slowdown in the world economy, I believe it is crucial that the European Union should look to its own strengths. How profoundly the bleak global economic climate will affect us is largely in our own hands. Particularly in view of developments in the United States and Japan, responsibility for the world economy falls on the European Union, and we must shoulder that responsibility. What is the present state of play in the European Union? As far as inflation is concerned, current forecasts indicate that prices are set to rise by more than 2% in two consecutive years, thereby exceeding the bounds of price stability as defined by the European Central Bank itself. External factors, however, such as the increase in oil prices, are playing an important part in this development. In this difficult environment, the European Central Bank is doing an excellent job. But it must continue to do everything in its power to avoid squandering the reserves of trust that have been vested in it. That is why we welcome its steady-handed policy, which we encourage it to keep pursuing. At this point, however, I must cast doubt on the consistency of last week’s interest-rate cut with this approach. In the domain of budgetary policy, most Member States have managed in the course of the past year to achieve the balanced budget prescribed in the Stability and Growth Pact. This, however, has been done with the aid of the proceeds from the sale of licences for the operation of universal mobile telecommunications systems (UMTS) as well as low interest rates and the increased tax revenue generated by accelerated economic growth. Some of the Member States, however, have not capitalised sufficiently on these favourable economic conditions to reduce their public deficits and their national debt. In view of the changes in the ageing pattern of the European population and the strain these are likely to put on the pension system, it is crucial that sufficient financial room for manoeuvre be created. Full use must be made, for example, of the potential for spending cuts in every area. This should not undermine the role of public investment, but such investment must be made judiciously in pursuit of defined strategic aims and must not be made at the expense of priority private investment. Looking to our own strengths also involves continuing the structural reforms of the Member States’ capital products and labour markets. The Stockholm summit failed to reach agreement on a firm timetable for the liberalisation of the European gas and electricity markets. I very much regret that. Nevertheless, we should make every effort to secure the liberalisation of the remaining state monopolies. This is essential if we are to achieve our avowed aim of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by the year 2010. At the same time, it is imperative to push ahead with the completion of the internal market. I need cite only two major examples in this context: firstly, agreement must be reached at long last on the Community patent; secondly, Community rules on public procurement should be applied to defence procurement too, wherever their application is warranted. (Applause)
 Particularly at a time when the European Union is taking steps to establish a common defence policy, the ring-fencing of national defence markets is inefficient, anachronistic and quite simply too expensive. The introduction of the euro on 1 January will affect the entire population of the European home market. If we want it to benefit the people of Europe, we need an economic policy that accords with the principles of social justice and market economics. (Applause)

 Mr President, may I say to Mr Lipietz that I continue to hold the position on which the vote was taken with regard to these two parts. I am not absolutely sure, however, whether last week’s interest-rate cut was entirely consistent with this policy. I have to express my personal doubts on that.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Katiforis for his report. What exactly is this report about? In May 1998, resolutions were passed making economic and monetary union a reality. At the time, economic and monetary union and the introduction of a European currency were irreversible. What were they based on back then? First, the independence of the European Central Bank, in order to safeguard monetary stability and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact, the purpose of which was to ensure that the European currency cannot be jeopardised by the budgets. Because our first objective in introducing the European currency – and this is particularly true of my Group – was a stable currency for Europe. We now have before us Mr Katiforis’s report on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. We must remember what this Stability and Growth Pact calls for. It calls for balanced budgets and for countries which are still overly in debt to achieve a surplus. At the time, when we were discussing the Stability and Growth Pact against the backdrop of the Maastricht Treaty, the important thing was not to exceed a new net debt level of 3%, which was the entry condition at the time. Today, the important thing is to achieve a balanced budget or a surplus. So what news on this front? The first item of news is positive: in the euro zone, i.e. in the twelve countries which have introduced the currency, which we also refer to as the European home market, we have on average, I repeat on average, balanced budgets. That is one very good point. On the other hand, however, we must face the facts. We achieved this objective in a period of growth which we shall be unable to match next year, namely with growth of 3.4%, i.e. in a fat year for the purposes of economic policy. The Bible exhorts us to save in fat years for the lean years ahead. Secondly, there were the UMTS licences, which gave our finance ministers a windfall. Thirdly, we must bear in mind that we have age pyramids in store for us and that we need to make provision for the expenditure in store for us here. I am firmly convinced that we have failed to grab this opportunity, we have failed to make proper use of this positive climate. What especially worries me is that some countries still have a very high level of overall debt and that, in some cases, these debts are still somewhat short-term in structure. We must face up to these risks. Which is why we also need to call for the consolidation efforts which have started – and which are impressive in some countries but insufficient in others – to continue. I have to say that my own country, Germany, gives me cause for concern, because our rate of growth is below the average in the euro zone. Nor have we managed to balance the budget, despite the huge windfall from UMTS licences in Germany. Now to my group’s stand on the Katiforis report. We can support it, as it now stands. However, we are concerned about two proposed amendments, both on the same subject, namely that investments should be excluded when calculating the Stability and Growth Pact margins. We agree that investments are needed and that budgets should be restructured towards greater investment, but within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is why, unfortunately, we shall have to vote against the Katiforis report if these proposed amendments attract a majority in the House.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals made by Alexander Lamfalussy on the type of legislative process needed in connection with the implementation of the financial services package are a step in the right direction because, for the first time, a clear distinction has been made here between the law, the directive, the regulation passed by the Council and Parliament and the technical implementation of the directive. As a result, adjustments to new developments in the technical sector can be made much more quickly than was the case in the past. The Heads of State or Government decided that the European Economic Area should become the most modern and the most competitive economic area, and this calls for a modern legislative procedure. If what has been thought up here later proves its worth, it can be applied in other areas during the technical legislative procedure, perhaps including agriculture. So what exactly is the problem? The problem is that even technical implementation, i.e. even the regulations issued on this basis, often conceal problems for our citizens. Here policy must be able to intervene and pull these points back into the decision-making process of the policy. When this happens, given that it is a codecision procedure, the European Parliament must have the same rights as the Council. What was agreed in Stockholm is a good agreement between the Commission and the Council, but Parliament has still been left out, which is why we need further negotiations in order to bring about a result which will also satisfy Parliament.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution which we are discussing this evening raises two issues. Firstly, the problem of Community legislation. If we examine the Community's legal sources, we have the original Treaty law, on the one hand, and directives and regulations, which are adopted with the involvement of Council and Parliament, on the other. But between the two, there is something else, which is often regarded as a source of law, namely the communications. We are discussing one of these communications today. Commissioner, you have rightly pointed out that this communication is merely an interpretation and is based on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. But it often seems as if the Commission is the only body to interpret the law, without any involvement by the Council or the European Parliament. The Commission acts as the sole legislator, as in the Byzantium of ancient times under Emperor Constantine. My law lecturer in Freiburg sometimes described the Commission's methods as the Imperial Byzantine approach to law-making as well. This is why I think it is absolutely crucial, in these very important cases, that directives or regulations are submitted and – as is right and proper – adopted with the participation of Parliament and the Council. The problem which we are addressing raises a second issue, namely competition in the European Community. Liberalisation – i.e. the abolition of monopolies – is one of the EU's success stories. In telecommunications in particular, we have seen that cutting costs and prices has genuinely benefited citizens. But there is a substantial danger here. We face a situation in which some are liberalising and opening up to competition, but others are not doing so. And we see that those who have not done sometimes win out, even with a monopoly, as long as the others are buying up, until the old public monopoly has been replaced by a private monopoly. The citizen then still faces a monopoly, as before, and derives no benefit from liberalisation. I think that the Commission needs to pay greater attention to this fact in its activities in future.

Mr President, with your permission, I should like first to make a comment on Parliament’s order of business. On the basis of Parliament’s order of business, on which this and other reports are entered for this morning, I promised to discuss the European economy with voters in my constituency in one hour’s time. I should therefore like to apologise in advance for being unable to stay until the end of this debate. I wish to make a few comments on the Wise Men’s proposal, but I shall start by thanking Baron Lamfalussy for his highly intelligent and far-reaching report on this subject and then take a position on the first part of this report, i.e. on the question of a fast-track procedure. The real issue here is that we want to fast track the passage and application of this important legislative package. And we have here an initial opportunity where the European Parliament has already stated that it is prepared, if at all possible and if the Council meets us half way here, to complete the legislative procedures at first reading. So if we can agree at first reading, then the European Parliament will be prepared to refrain from tabling any further proposed amendments at second reading. That goes without saying. I think it would be a good idea if we were to select two very important pilot projects here, such as the regulations on pension funds, which are crucial, and a simpler issue such as the regulations on prospectuses in the European Union, and use these projects to see exactly what happens here if we shift legislation to a secondary level. I should like to say a word on the question of whether democracy costs time. Time and again we hear that Parliament’s being allowed a possible three readings to deal with a question extends the legislative procedure unnecessarily. I cannot agree with that. Think back to the old days of unanimity, when the legislative procedure in the European Union took up to 20 years. There are quite specific examples of this, such as the product liability directive. Experience has shown that we are able to complete important legislative procedures in two years with the new codecision procedure. I think this shows that it is possible to have a democratic procedure which does not take an overly long time. Now to the second question, i.e. the implementation of legislation in the European Union. We agree with the Wise Men’s proposal on most points, unlike the Council, which has reservations. However, as the European Parliament, we unanimously demand a callback right in cases in which we feel that errors have been made in implementing the legislation. This too is a unanimous call and will shortly be adopted in the resolution.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to deal with why we have tabled this issue regarding decisions in Ireland. I believe that it should be considered that we have reached a new stage in the development of the European Union and in the integration of the economies in the European Union. Today twelve Member States make up a Common Market with a single currency. A domestic market in the original sense. It is imperative that economic policy in this European domestic market is drawn up in accordance with common guidelines. In this respect, we are pleased that the European Commission and the Ecofin Council have taken action in this area. It is the first time that a decision regarding one of these Member States has been taken in this way and this decision concerns the stability of the European currency. As you are aware, in all debates in this House my group has repeatedly granted the utmost priority to the stability of the European currency and we shall continue to do so in future. We believe that a stable currency is one of the key building blocks for a social market economy and that this is also necessary for the European currency. Let there be no doubt that this shall remain a priority for us in the future. However, I would ask whether the European Commission and the members of the Ecofin Council have picked the right target for this, the first decision of its kind. Ireland is without a shadow of a doubt one of the European Union’s model children. It is questionable whether other countries are in the position to reduce their deficits. Ireland achieves surpluses. Other countries still have a huge total debt of over 100% while at the same time Ireland is in the process of reducing its debt to under 40% and so can likewise be held up as a model for other European Union Member States. While other countries are battling unemployment, Ireland has made exemplary progress in this regard with the creation of new jobs. While other Member States are battling with slow economic growth, Ireland is enjoying growth rates that other Member States can only dream of. It should be said, however, that the Irish economy is overheating as a result of this strong growth and that, consequently, there is a risk that this could be to the disadvantage of the Irish people. For example, if I take rent and property prices in Dublin and compare these with those in Frankfurt it becomes quite clear that the development of these prices also has a detrimental effect on the Irish people. In this respect clearly something must be done. The question is, however, who shall take the action? Should it be the European Union who intervenes or is this a matter that should and can be settled by Ireland, the Irish Government or the Irish Parliament themselves? This then raises the question: who should be responsible for European economic policy in the future? We must work towards ensuring that this responsibility is set out quite clearly. We must be clear on who is responsible for what, so that where there is success praise may be given and where there is failure, which may also occur, we are able to say that a particular country or a particular institution is at fault. A clear division of tasks is now emerging within the European Union. The European Union is without doubt responsible for competition, the competition between businesses in the European Union. As Commissioner Mario Monti has demonstrated time and time again, the European Commission takes this task very seriously indeed. The European Commission is also responsible for currency stability, on the one hand through the strong European Central Bank and on the other hand through finance ministers, charged with monitoring the stability and growth pact. The European Union, is therefore responsible for competition and currency stability. Responsibility for taxes, on the other hand, still undoubtedly lies with the Member States of the European Union. The same applies to social security systems and education. This then raises the question: what is happening with currency stability or, more precisely, have occurrences in Ireland jeopardised currency stability within the eurozone? Just imagine a different situation. Imagine that the inflation rate in Germany stands at 6 or 7%. As Germany makes up one third of the gross national product in the eurozone, this would instantly lead to a sharp increase in the average inflation rates in the European Union, to such an extent that the European Central Bank would be forced to spring into action and thus the economy would be curbed. Ireland is however a small economy with a gross national product little above that of west London. The overheating of the Irish economy has no influence whatsoever at a European level, so there is no need for action at the level of the European Central Bank. Ireland no longer has the opportunity as before, when the Irish Central Bank could raise interest rates, of contributing to the deceleration of the economy. Therefore, Ireland must themselves be responsible, also for the Irish people, for reducing the overheating of the economy somehow or other. How this is to be achieved I leave up to the Irish. I do not wish to raise this at the level of the European Union. Now, turning to my second question. On 12 January a decision was made by the European Commission to pay EUR 401 million to Ireland. EUR 726 million in supplementary funds followed, funds that were also pumped into the Irish economy. In this regard I would like to ask whether a conversation took place between Commissioner Solbes and Commissioner Barnier with a view to resolving this obvious contradiction. In other words, what is happening in Germany, in France and in Italy gives much more cause for concern regarding the stability of the euro. I hope that the European Commission will have the same courage, when it comes to dealing with these large countries. (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have set themselves the goal of turning the European Union into a truly dynamic, competitive, knowledge-based economic area over the next ten years. We will have to make enormous efforts to achieve this and it will only be possible if we succeed in mobilising the forces which are currently slumbering in European enterprises and in European research and training establishments, in the context of an open market economy. We are on the right path. I found what Mr Prodi said yesterday very encouraging. Soon, the single currency will be introduced and an optimum currency area will be created through enhanced mobility within the European Union. We are moving forwards in terms of protecting intellectual property, which is also important if we want to mobilise research. I believe that the European patent is an important step along this road. We also need to move more quickly in liberalising telecommunications, energy and the postal services, if we want to get closer to these goals. We also need to create a European economic policy based on common principles and I am convinced that can only be done in terms of a social market economy. But the question is this: who is responsible for this economic policy? Or are the responsibilities different? There are areas which are clearly allocated to the European Union: the area of competition, where the European Union has the strongest powers; the area of monetary stability, which is monitored by the European Central Bank, and the Stability and Growth Pact – these are the most important instruments. They are the areas which fall to the European Union. There are other areas where responsibility clearly lies with the Member States, such as taxes, social security systems and training. Here, Europe can only make a contribution through dialogue; it is not empowered to make decisions. As far as the collection of data is concerned, which Mr Bullmann proposed, my opinion is that, clearly, for us in the European Union, the areas where the European Union makes decisions must be given top priority. In areas in which the European Union contributes through dialogue, the collection of data need only be accorded secondary priority. Where do I think these priorities lie? In which areas will we need more information before long? We need more up-to-date information for example on the development of GDP and its components. We need more data on the growth of services in the European Union. We know a great deal about production in the European Union but too little about the development of services. At the moment, we have inadequate data on the balance of payments of Euroland, and these are fundamental principles which underpin decision making, for example when the European Central Bank takes its decisions on interest rates. As regards other data, the essential thing is to get a dialogue going in order to come up with the principles of benchmarking. I must make it very clear that, in the case of data collected in this area, I would regard it as disastrous if, once it is available, such data was misused for planned economic intervention in the economic affairs of the European Union, and we need to build in the relevant safeguards in advance. This data, which I believe, in full agreement with Mr Bullmann, we need, must be used to increase competition between Member States. By having common borders on the outside and open borders on the inside allowing the free circulation of people, goods, services and capital, we in the European Union have created competition not only between enterprises but also between Member States, which is aimed at offering the people of Europe the services they expect from the state at better prices and under better conditions. It is my firm belief that the data mentioned in the Bullmann report should be used for this purpose. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and the EIB for the very open dialogue we have been able to have over recent months. Today’s debate shows that the work of the European Central Bank has, in the main, been assessed very positively, which, President Maystadt, I am sure you welcome. The European Central Bank has an especially important role when it comes to improving European Community structures in less developed regions. Two thirds of its disbursements go towards this. But I also believe trans-European networks are of major importance, especially for transport, and they need to be set up along European lines. We see that a common European economic area is emerging. But we also see that the traffic situation is very often still following the old limitations and priorities of past centuries. I believe that a common European market, a domestic market and an optimal currency area must incorporate a corresponding infrastructure and transport infrastructure. All the activities of the European Central Bank in this area are of special importance. I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance, especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. For SMEs, especially those which are innovative and assume risks, simply granting loans is often insufficient; venture capital also needs to be made available. In recent years the EIB has developed its own initiatives which, in my opinion, are especially welcome.

 Mr President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has made it very clear that the majority of Members of the European Parliament is disappointed by the outcome of Nice. The real reason is as follows. In Nice, transparency and democracy for the European Union fell by the wayside. What happened? We find the Council applying the qualified majority principle in more and more areas. That prevents any scrutiny by the national parliaments, whose decisions can, of course, be outvoted by the respective majorities in the Council. But this democratic scrutiny has, unfortunately, not been replaced by democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament nor, unfortunately, by codecision by the European Parliament. Here, I am convinced, lies the crucial weakness of what was decided in Nice. Mr President of the Council, Sweden has a great tradition of democracy and transparency. I expect the Swedish Presidency to support us in our endeavour to remedy these weaknesses of Nice and to strengthen the legitimacy of democratic decisions in the European Union again, and I am convinced it will do so. I want to address a second point. During its term of office the Swedish Presidency must prepare for the introduction of the euro, i.e. of the notes and coins, in 12 European Union countries. The question we keep asking ourselves is this: who actually represents the euro externally? I am persuaded that the European Commission ought to undertake to do more here than it has to date. The French Presidency gave us clear information. Accordingly, the president of the 12 EU countries represents the euro externally. That in turn leads to a paradoxical situation. The Swedish Finance Minister represents the European Union externally for general economic policy questions, while when it comes to the euro, to the euro currency, this job goes to the Belgian Finance Minister. If even we in the European Parliament cannot understand that, how are the citizens of the European Union supposed to understand it? How are the markets to understand it? We must do our outmost to return to a sensible situation here. You, Foreign Minister, can make a major contribution here. If you manage to persuade your fellow-countrymen that the euro is a good project, that it is stable from within, that its external stability is also constantly improving; if you can persuade them to support this great project of European integration, you will also help ensure that the citizens gain a better understanding of this aspect of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to address the question of the taxation of electronic services and to clarify the nature of the problem. When goods are traded electronically across borders, VAT is levied as a matter of course. When an item physically crosses the national border, unless that item can be transferred electronically, VAT is levied. The question arising here is whether VAT is levied when such items are the subject of a service which is provided electronically. Even in these cases, we have many instances in which VAT is already levied. If the transaction takes place within the European Union between two Member States, VAT is levied. I am told that, when transactions are effected between states in the US, the applicable sales taxes are also levied in certain cases. The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU. There can be no doubt at all that this constitutes a distortion of competition, being detrimental both to retailers who, though they do not sell the same items, deal in similar products and to suppliers who offer the same sort of product from countries within the EU. Such distortion of competition cannot be tolerated in the long run, which is why I should like to say on behalf of my group that we endorse the proposals on this matter by the European Commission and by the rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil. In essence, it is only a question of finding a set of rules now so that these matters can be administered with as little red tape as possible. In this respect, the French proposal that registration be carried out in fifteen countries is surely not a suitable solution. The second point on our agenda is the taxation of aviation fuel. Here too, I go along with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in principle. The taxation of aviation fuel is desirable for various reasons, but it is our firm belief that it can only be taxed on the basis of an international regime. If the European Union goes it alone, the result will be that flights from Frankfurt to the Costa del Sol, for example, will become considerably more expensive than flights from Frankfurt to Florida. That too is an unacceptable distortion of competition to the detriment of European operators. I therefore believe that efforts must be undertaken to create an international regime for the taxation of aviation fuel. My group and I take the view that unilateral European action would be unwise. (Applause)

 Madam President, when we discussed this in committee, we assumed that this debate would take place in January. After all, this is a second reading.

 We are continuing the debate on the report by Mrs Villiers, whom I want to congratulate very heartily on her report. She has managed to reconcile the different opinions across the committee, so I believe this report represents a real step forward. In particular, it is important that she managed, by achieving a very broad majority in committee, to ensure that the requirements of the small institutions – the savings banks, the cooperative banks, the small and medium-sized businesses – are also given due consideration in this important legislative project and that what is called internal rating, i.e. the internal assessment of credit risks, will be given the same status as external rating, as proposed by the Basel Committee. I regard that as major progress. I believe it is also important in terms of the public debate to make it clear that it is not the Basel Committee, a non-elected body, that will be deciding the definitive directives, but the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, by the codecision procedure. In that public debate I keep finding people referring to the Basel Committee. In fact, the European Parliament will decide on the final legislative text jointly with the Council of Ministers, and we should make people more aware of that. But for me the question now is the procedure that will apply. The banking sector is very keen that we decide by a fast-track procedure. I, too, believe that Parliament should play its part here and, if possible, take the final decision at first reading. However, we must create the necessary conditions to ensure that the European Parliament's rights are in no way weakened. If possible, by one means or another, we must ensure that Parliament and the Council of Ministers can reach agreement at first reading on the legislative text that is then finalised. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, we are grateful to you for your report on trends in net government borrowing in the European Union, Mr Solbes Mira. I believe that, overall, the message here is a positive one. When the Maastricht Treaty was drawn up, it was assumed that maximum permissible net government borrowing would be 3%. Today, taking the average for the euro area, it has dropped back to around 1%, and we are moving towards balanced budgets, that is to say very much in the right direction. Commissioner, does it not worry you that it appears that in Germany next year, instead of falling, net government borrowing will increase by a further 0.5%, despite the fact that income from UMTS licences this year has been like manna from heaven for Germany's finances? We have noted that this development is taking place in the largest country in the euro area, whereas the Netherlands and Finland have already achieved what we are seeking, that is budget surpluses which enable excessive debt to be repaid. So let me ask you once again: does this not worry you? I would like to stress once again that we in the Group of the European People's Party regard the independence of the European Central Bank, combined with consistent application of stability and growth factors, as being a fundamental requirement for price stability in Europe.

 Madam President, since the borders between the Member States of the European Union were opened, an increasing number of firms have been taking advantage of the opportunities offered by this common market. At that time we had to note on the one hand that freight transport had been made considerably easier, but that on the other there were still major barriers and costs associated with making the corresponding payments. The first study on this subject, which was carried out at the instigation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, showed at the time that cross-border transfers of over DEM 1 000 cost 25% on average, and as much as 75% in individual cases. You have to bear in mind that small and medium-sized businesses are of course the ones primarily affected by this. When the markets between the Member States of the European Union were opened up, our ambition as Members of the European Parliament was never to create access for large companies, which they had of course had for a long time already; it was always to open up this large European market to small and medium-sized businesses. That is why I am extremely grateful to our rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, for the persistency with which she has pursued this objective for many years, that is to bring down the costs of making transfers between the Member States of the European Union. I have to stress that there have already been some improvements here, that average transfer costs are much lower than they were when the borders were opened between the Member States, but I should like to emphasise just as clearly that they are still far too high and that further action is needed here. The banks repeatedly tell us – and with some justification – that the necessary facilities to effect transfers of this kind, the giro systems which exist in the individual domestic markets, are still not fully operational at European level. A major effort is needed here. This remark is not directed solely at the European Central Bank, but also at the various banking associations which we have in the European Union. What we wish to see is not just one single transfer system – which would once again be a monopoly – but competition between different transfer systems set up by different banks and groups of banks, competition which will at long last work in favour of the public and in favour of small and medium-sized businesses. (Applause)

 Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Radwan, on the excellent report he has presented here. And I would like to thank you, Mr Duisenberg, very sincerely for your report as President of the European Central Bank. The thing that has particularly agitated the public during the first 18 months of the euro’s existence has been the exchange rate against the dollar. The ECB itself eventually had to pay some attention to this question, because there started to be a risk that imported inflation would become a reality here in Europe. What caused this initial drop in the exchange rate? We have to recognise that the international financial markets noticed that we in Europe have been slow in tackling some of the structural reforms needed. Secondly, the euro is a new currency. A new currency has to win the confidence that other currencies already enjoy. Thirdly, there was a not inconsiderable gap between our interest rates and those in the United States, which meant that investors felt more inclined to invest in the United States than in Europe. It also has to be recognised that the ECB’s policy has very consistently been different from that of the US Federal Reserve Bank. In this case, the guidelines Mr Duisenberg has been operating under are not the same as Mr Greenspan’s. For example, in the United States the inflation rate has topped 3% in recent months, without the Federal Reserve Bank taking any special countermeasures. Over here, the upper limit is set at 2%, and for very good reasons. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Duisenberg, on having pursued a very consistent stability policy, and on having given a very clear signal when the ECB made its most recent decision on interest rates. You spoke just now about new technology, about the new economy. The objective of the European Central Bank will remain the same, even with the new economy, and that is to maintain price stability.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mr Karas on his excellent report, but at the same time to say that we are not at present satisfied with the European Commission’s information policy. We wish to remind the House that the euro information programme is also, as defined in the budget, a joint European Commission and European Parliament programme. During the last parliamentary term there was a committee led by Mr Anastassopoulos which laid down the essential features of information policy in this area. It was very successful at that point. We also managed at that time to secure a full and key role for Members of the European Parliament in this information campaign, via the political foundations. This has not happened during this new parliamentary term. This body, which consisted of the Commissioner responsible and the relevant committee chairs, has not yet been convened. Some of the procedures dating from the last parliamentary term have still not been discharged to this day. We therefore have to ask in the clearest possible terms what should happen next. For this reason, my first request is that a meeting of this body should be called as quickly as possible. That is my first point. The second point that I would briefly like to touch upon relates to an observation regarding the substance of the information campaign. If you compare prices in the Eleven, that is in Euroland, with prices in other countries which have remained outside the Eleven, including the United Kingdom but also Switzerland and Norway, where this is particularly apparent, you will see that price levels in Euroland, even in the ‘rich’ countries, are generally speaking lower than in the other countries. This means that the European single currency is already leading to greater competition in this area, and that in turn this competition is leading to the public getting goods and services on more favourable terms. A study should be carried out on this, something which is also called for in the Karas report.

Mr President, 
ladies and gentlemen, during a previous debate on economic policy, Jacques Delors said in this House that these days, 70% of the economic framework conditions that are enacted in the form of laws are European directives. I would not wish to commit myself to a percentage in this respect, but we should all be aware that some of the economic framework conditions are established by the European Union and others are established by the Member States. This state of affairs will only prove successful in the long term if it is accomplished on the basis of common principles. The principle enshrined in the Treaty is that of the market economy – the majority in this House would say the social market economy – and there are two key aspects to this. Firstly, there is competition. The European Union is very good at creating conditions for competition. I welcome with open arms the initiatives produced by the Commission aimed at gradually decentralising competition policy and this desire to foster competition and to allow the individual Member States and the regions to play their part in the process. This is a very important development.   The second important cornerstone of the social market economy is the stability of the currency. Firstly, we have the European Central Bank, a strong European institution. Secondly, we have the social partners, who are responsible for currency stability, and thirdly, there are the national governments and parliaments, which draft their budgets. I feel I should point out that not only is currency stability one of the cornerstones of economic policy, it is also one of the cornerstones of any social policy, because currency stability is the starting point for social policy, and inflation does not affect those with huge assets at their disposal, but those who have to manage on a small income. That is why currency stability is such an important cornerstone of our policy. And one of the crucial cornerstones we have created is the Stability and Growth Pact. I am delighted that this report is now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be rigorously applied, for what we want for the European Union is growth based on currency stability.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, always particularly nerve-racking when one has occasion to make a speech in the European Parliament before such a packed house. That said, it might also help one to overcome stage fright. What is decisive though, is not the quantity but the quality of the people in the audience.   (Laughter, Applause)
 We are continuing the debate on the accession of Greece to the euro zone and, of course, we must have noticed that the tone of this debate has been influenced by the exchange rate weakness of the euro and enlargement, and we have kept in mind the fact that any decision we take now may set a precedent for future candidate countries. I feel we should take account of this throughout the debate.   At the same time though, we must stick to the facts. The fact of the matter is that the European Commission and the ECB have presented us with reports. Both reports state – the one from the European Central Bank does so with a few more reservations perhaps – that Greece has fulfilled the criteria of the Treaty of Maastricht. If one looks a little more closely at the facts and figures, then it is possible to discern positive and negative aspects. On the plus side, one cannot help but notice that inflation – which was still running at 20.4% in 1990, when Greece started the consolidation process – fell to 2% in March of the year 2000. That is undoubtedly a most impressive achievement.   The second important criterion is the public deficit. It was still at 7.6% in 1996 and fell to 1.5% in 1999. That too is a most laudable achievement on the part of Greek economic policy. However, there are also concerns to be registered here. First, there is the fact that the criteria relating to the inflation rate were only fulfilled very late in the day, in the course of the last few months, and that the lowering of excise duty must have had something to do with this. Then there is the question of total debt, which is still in excess of 100%, and is only inching towards the prescribed 60%. We have some weighing up to do here.   I feel we should also take account of the fact that in the wake of the European Central Bank’s statement, the markets have, in principle, anticipated Greece’s accession to monetary union, and so if we were to reject this statement, it would not benefit the euro exchange rate in the least, but would, on the other hand, do considerable damage to the Greek economy. I believe we should bear this in mind when forming an objective assessment of the situation. Hence, we are in favour of Greece joining the euro zone, but with some reservations. The majority of my Group will vote in favour, however, as we have included several amendments in the Pomés Ruiz report that highlight our concerns.   Firstly, it is made quite clear that the Maastricht criteria must be applied in full to all future candidate countries, and no more precedents are to be established in this respect.  Secondly, there must be sustainability as far as the rate of inflation is concerned. I believe that if Greece were to step up its implementation of internal market directives, which actually enhance competition, then this would help to achieve this goal.   Thirdly, the proceeds from privatisation should be used to reduce debt. These are the conditions under which the majority of my Group will vote in favour of Greece joining the euro zone.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to highlight three demands that we have to make of the Intergovernmental Conference, although all of them relate to the same facts. We are now approaching the time when we will have a Community with a single currency and a common currency policy that is largely dictated by the European Central Bank. But we still have 15 different economic policies in the Member States of the European Union, and we will only succeed in the long-term if this economic policy is framed according to common principles. Hence our first demand is that we should firmly establish the social market economy, which adds a human dimension to the functioning of the market, in the European Treaty, as a model for our economic policy.   Our second demand is for Parliament’s participation in the drafting of the economic policy guidelines, which we have already discussed here today, to be placed on a more formal footing, i.e. the Commission should present us not with a recommendation but a formal proposal, on which we can then be consulted in the true sense of the word.   Our third demand relates to competition policy. On the one hand, competition policy is the key to the social market economy, on the other hand, however, it is also the most robust instrument of economic policy that the European Community has at its disposal. Numerous decisions on individual cases are taken in matters of competition policy and that is quite clearly the task of the Commission. But in future, whenever general rules are drawn up, or the Commission drafts guidelines in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, then the European Parliament must also be involved in the codecision procedure, for only then will Parliament be able to realise its goal of becoming a fully-fledged member of the European forum, where European economic policy is not just discussed publicly, but is also framed with the participation of Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safeguarding pensions is an extremely important task facing our age. We are conscious of the fact that numerous pension schemes in the various Member States, based on the intergeneration compact, are encountering ever-increasing difficulties. That is why the issue of supplementary pensions has become so very important, and that is what we are discussing this evening. When it comes to supplementary pensions and pension funds, our first priority in regulatory terms is to ensure that the rules governing the Common Market are upheld, and that no additional restrictions to the free movement of persons within the European Community are created, as is often the case.   We are aware that this is still the case today for many social security systems, and we must avoid the possibility of similar restrictions to the free movement of persons arising in this new sphere as well. That is why certain common minimum provisions need to be put in place here. We need certain minimum regulations for the protection of financial investments, and we anticipate that suitable proposals will be drafted and improved on to this end.  The second quite crucial issue is that of tax breaks, this being possible at three different stages: at the paying-in stage, then afterwards on the interest that is paid, and then at the payout stage. The arrangements for this vary from one Member State to another, and if we want these funds to be compatible throughout the European Community then we are going to have to produce common provisions. This is not going to be a piece of cake. We all know that taxation is subject to the unanimity principle, but this is one of the fundamental demands we have to make.   I now come to the crunch question of this debate, namely what are pensions? What are pension funds? I have to say, we are still only halfway through the debate where this is concerned. We have not reached a conclusive opinion within our Group either. There is only one thing I can say with certainty: biometric risks must play a part in this overall assessment in some respect. In other words, if we do not take biometric risks into account, then it will not be possible to address the other issues I have mentioned. But we are quite deliberately proposing an open style of wording, as chosen by Mr Ferri for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in points 7 and 8. I believe this kind of wording will attract the broadest consensus here, and therefore enable us to make progress, for what matters most is that the directives are now put forward to us. I believe it will not be possible to answer some of the questions we are discussing today until we can assess them in the light of the Commission’s proposals, the actual draft directives, that is.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in the speeches which we have heard a noble aim has been mentioned, that of we Europeans becoming competitive with the United States, of developing ourselves into equal partners with the United States. If we consider our gross national product, that ought actually to be possible. If, on the other hand, we look, for example, at the issue of filling top posts – when it is a question of finding a new Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund – and see how the Europeans behave towards the Americans, then without a doubt we are still a very long way from this equal partnership. We now need to ask ourselves why this is the case. Of course there are sectors of the business world, including the new media, in which we occupy leading positions. Here I need only mention mobile telephones. We have banned them here in the Chamber, rightly, because they are instruments of torment. At the same time, however, they also make life much easier for many people because they create jobs. And in Europe we are world leaders in this field. Why? We are world leaders because we managed to adopt a common set of European rules; early on we decided on a common European standard which today has become a world standard. This means that if we in Europe get our act together in good time then we will also be competitive in this field of new technologies. Where then do Europe's shortcomings actually lie? I believe, Mr President-in-Office, that we cannot eliminate the shortcomings by setting up more observatories as is planned at present. I believe that these observatories create a handful of jobs for officials, but that they do not create any jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises. We in Europe are deficient where training is concerned. This is shown by the fact that where the new media are concerned we are having to import from countries outside Europe. Europe lacks, as has already been stated, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial spirit. There are too few young people who are willing to take the risk of being self-employed. The way in which we structure our work and the way in which work is organised is not flexible enough. Establishing additional rigid rules – such as, for example, introducing a rigid 35-hour week in France – can, I admit, create jobs in the short term, but I am convinced that in the long term it damages our competitiveness and thus destroys jobs. In Europe we are also still a long way from a common domestic market. We have 15 domestic markets and a common European internal market. For electronic commerce we need common, clear, European rules. We need a European patent at a reasonable price; we do not have that yet either. This European patent is so expensive that it is not competitive with other patents. We need the European company legislation, and not least we need to adapt our social security systems to the new reality of a common Europe, because this too forms the basis of what we call the social model, namely a social market economy for Europe.

 Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that my friend Giorgos Katiforis is still able to muster so much enthusiasm for this very important subject so late in the evening. I would be more than pleased to accede to his request, but first and foremost, I would like to begin with the analysis.   Surely the first question we must ask ourselves is: how is the European Union’s economic policy proceeding at the moment, or rather, how is the economic policy of the eleven Member States proceeding at present, for that is what it all revolves around after all? We have asked experts about this and they gave very interesting answers. However, I believe that the most important judges as to whether a country is pursuing sound or poor economic policy are currently the international financial markets and developments that are then reflected in the exchange rates. In which connection, we know that the euro is weak against the dollar; in other words, the international markets have given a poor assessment of the economic policy currently being pursued by the eleven Member States of the European Union whose currency is the euro.   Why should this be so? Is it down to the European Central Bank? Definitely not. The European Union is in good financial shape. The European Central Bank has all the instruments at its disposal that a central bank could wish for. The European Central Bank is headed by convincing personalities. They have also fulfilled their task of monitoring price stability and the interest rate policies they have pursued have been completely in line with this task. So it cannot be down to the European Central Bank.   Is it down to the forecasts concerning growth and employment in the coming years? The forecasts are absolutely excellent. It is forecast that economic growth will run at 3%, as compared with 1.9% in the 90s. Unemployment is expected to fall, albeit slowly. Price stability in the European Union is better in the eleven Member States than it is in the United States. We have price stability, inflation running at less than 2%. Long-term interest rates are also lower than they are in the United States.   The real reason why the European countries are not finding favour is the fact that we are too slow in tackling the structural reform Europe needs. First and foremost, there is the flexibility of labour markets. We are aware that unemployment has fallen more quickly in those countries, including EU Member States, which have made their labour markets more flexible, than it has in other countries. In some countries unemployment is now below 5%.   Then there is the major undertaking of reforming the social security systems and adapting them to the requirements of a European home market – here too, we in Europe are lagging far behind. There is also a need to improve conditions for research and development: firstly, there is technophobia within the European Union, which certainly hampers research and development in the EU. Coupled with this is the fact that the protection of intellectual property here in Europe, particularly for small and medium-sized firms – and they are especially creative – is too expensive and does not operate adequately.   I also believe that, as matters stand with regard to electronic money, we are about to miss out on opportunities that other countries are already exploiting as we speak, because we are taking too long to adapt the framework conditions. We are also failing to adapt our training systems in good time. For example, if there is currently demand in Germany for electronics experts to be brought into the European Union from other countries, then this only goes to show that our own training systems have failed and that they have not been equipped to deal with the requirements of the information society in good time. In other words, things are moving too slowly.   The adjustments that need to be made with regard to dismantling monopolies are proceeding too slowly as well. We have come a relatively long way as far as telecommunications is concerned. We still fall a long way short on the postal services front and there is also still a lot to be done in terms of dismantling monopolies in the energy sector. What is more, we have reason to fear that, in some sectors, private monopolies could replace the old public monopolies, which would mean that, in terms of competition, and in terms of what benefits the public most, we would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.   But now perhaps a few words on the fundamental difference between our opinion and that of the rapporteur. The rapporteur believes in growth and stimulating demand. He regards this as a panacea. Alongside the many issues where our opinions do not differ to anything like the same extent, this is what stood out from the rapporteur’s proposals. I believe it would not be totally wide of the mark to describe his stance on this issue as belonging to the old Keynesian school of thought.   By contrast, we take the view that this kind of economic policy would be lop-sided, and that we should give attention not only to stimulating demand, but also to supply conditions and the structural reforms I have just mentioned. We must set to work on these now, for only then will we be able to hold our own in the face of global competition.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s White Paper on modernisation of the European competition rules has ignited intense and lively debate amongst interested members of the public. The reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support. What is this White Paper, in fact, about? The existing system of European competition rules was set up in the early years of the Community. This system, which is based on a centralised application and approvals procedure, was certainly appropriate for the conditions prevailing at the time. This procedure made a substantial contribution to the development of a European competition culture. However, the framework conditions have fundamentally changed in the 40 years since it came into being. The Community of 6 has enlarged to one of 15 and is set to undergo further enlargement to encompass 27 members. But the system has hardly changed at all. That is why there is an urgent need for reform, and no one takes issue with this in debate. Nevertheless, certain critics are of the opinion that the Commission’s proposals go too far. The Commission wants to abolish the application and approvals procedure and enhance the role of national authorities and courts in the implementation of the competition rules. In other words, this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption. However, the prohibition principle, and this is important, is to be retained. In principle, I take the view that we ought, when an authority accused of tending towards bureaucracy and centralism, submits a proposal for debureaucratisation and decentralisation, to at least give this serious consideration. According to the Commission's proposal, it all revolves around competition-inhibiting agreements between enterprises and abuses of powerful positions. However, the notification obligation, with respect to state aid and corporate concentrations, is to be retained. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gave its blessing in principle to these proposals put forward by the Commission, with only one vote against and two abstentions. However, it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the Commission are published.   Whilst I may endorse the Commission’s proposals in principle, still there are a number of points that warrant improvement, or at least clarification. I would like to go into some of these points briefly. Many critics of the White Paper maintain that decentralisation will jeopardise the consistent application of Community legislation. Not all national authorities, in particular the courts, are in a position as yet to fulfil the role the Commission has in mind for them when it comes to the application of the competition rules. Firstly, in the course of the last few decades the national monopolies have familiarised themselves with the implementation of the competition rules to an adequate degree. Secondly, the national courts will be empowered to implement Articles 81 (1), 82 and 86 in accordance with the current administration of justice. Nonetheless, it is still extremely important for the Commission to support the national authorities and courts with group exemption regulations, guidelines and notices. Furthermore, cooperation between the national authorities and the Commission, as well as amongst the national authorities themselves, must be strengthened. As far as the competence of the national courts is concerned, we recommend in this report that specialised courts be set up for dealing with monopolies law proceedings. These are already in existence in certain Member States and they have proved successful. Entrepreneurs, for their part, fear a loss of legal certainty. In order to guard against this, the enterprises should, in certain cases, continue to have the opportunity of being given prior clarification by the Commission. These are only a few, albeit central aspects that must be taken into account where the modernisation of the European competition rules is concerned. That said, the process is still very much in its infancy. Discussion will continue until such time as legislative proposals are eventually produced. However, I am convinced of the fact that the White Paper has put us on the right path.   A European competition culture has come into being in the course of the last few decades. The decentralisation proposed by the Commission accords with the principle of subsidiarity, which has, in fact, now been firmly established in the Treaty. This leads to increased implementation of the European competition rules at national and regional level, thereby making it possible for the European competition culture to be placed on a broader basis. Finally, I would like to say that the competition policy reform we are introducing here is a necessity and that it is going to be absolutely necessary, in this context, to clarify that the European Union’s competition policy is an essential pre-requisite to the success of a social market economy. Both the Commission and Parliament must do more than they have done hitherto to get the message across that competition policy, competition between enterprises, and the fact that the European Commission is supervising this, are first and foremost matters which have the interests of the citizens at heart. (Applause)

Madam President, I should like to make a point of order and table a motion. We in the European Parliament have asked time and again for the debates held here to be held in the presence of the competent Commissioner. We understand that Commissioner Byrne has been held up by transport problems and that Commissioner Monti has read the Commission’s opinion. However, I consider it absolutely necessary that the competent Commissioner should hear what Members have to say before being given the opportunity to reply, since otherwise the debate which we wish to hold does not in fact take place. I should therefore like to move that we adjourn this debate and begin the debate on competition, as suggested, so that the Members concerned with the beef question can speak in the presence of the competent Commissioner. I therefore move that this debate be adjourned now and that we proceed to the next item on the agenda.

Madam President, I fear that we may waste a great deal of time on this debate on a point of order. I moved, quite clearly, to adjourn this debate and to resume it after the debate on competition.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are discussing today contains Parliament’s proposals for reforming the European Union. This is necessary because of the forthcoming enlargement. The reform is also necessary, however, due to the fact that now, for the time being, eleven countries have a common monetary policy. This necessitates the Member States’ at least pursuing their economic policies on the basis of common principles. The economic system prescribed in the Treaty of Rome has remained the basis of the Community’s economic policy. It is a system of open markets. In a number of Member States, one particular concept has been adopted. It bears the name “social market economy”. I would recommend that this concept of the social market economy be incorporated into the Treaty. That is also the view of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.  A significant part of the Member States’ economic policy revolves around tax policy. Here, through Europe’s internal market, competition between the economic systems has arisen which, in the area of VAT, for example, has led to tax rates’ converging. However, the internal market in this area is not complete because the anticipated changeover to the country of origin principle has not yet taken place. This is one example of why the requirement of unanimity in the Council has led to paralysis in decision making and therefore to a reduction in economic performance. As a result, our economic growth is lower and unemployment higher. That is why it is necessary, at least when it comes to the procedures for collecting taxes effective across national borders (VAT in particular), to permit qualified majority voting in the Council.  A further problem area is Parliament’s still inadequate participation in the legislative procedures concerning competition. Competition is the key to our industry’s competitiveness and therefore a prerequisite for Europe’s ability to embrace the future. We therefore demand, where legislative procedures in this area too are concerned, that the European Parliament be involved in the decision-making process.  What we request is that, in a number of areas in which, in full adherence to the principle of subsidiarity, the Treaties now already accord Europe a key role, the role of Parliament should be strengthened and the principle of majority voting established in the Council.

 Mr President, President Duisenberg, I too would like to express my delight at being able to welcome President Duisenberg here today. Why is the debate we are having today so important? The European Central Bank is autonomous, and my group is surely the one which always stressed this most. But, at the same time, the European Central Bank must make decisions which concern every individual citizen of Europe. It is therefore particularly important that the bank should not exist in an ivory tower but that it should continue to justify itself to the public. There are a variety of ways in which it can achieve this. I would also like to point out that the European Parliament has a particularly privileged role here. The European Parliament is explicitly mentioned in the Treaties as the partner of the European Central Bank in dialogue, and this is not the case in the same way with other institutions. The European Parliament is a forum where all of Europe can in fact take part in the debate; though I would have liked to see a rather larger participation in this debate today, for I am of the opinion that this debate is of great significance. The European Central Bank is autonomous. It is committed in the first instance to ensuring price stability. At this point, I would like to remind Mrs Randzio-Plath that the Treaty plainly stipulates that the prime objective of the European Central Bank is to ensure price stability and that any other objectives may be pursued only if they can be achieved without any risk to price stability, and that price stability itself, as the President has already stated, can have positive social and economic effects. On behalf of my group, I should like to say that the European Central Bank has achieved some outstanding work in the course of this last year, since it was founded. It has taken some very important decisions, for example, its decision on the definition of price stability. That is of very great significance for the long-term development of our debate on this question. Even in its decision regarding the minimum reserves, which were rather controversial, the European Central Bank, i.e. the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, has demonstrated great perceptiveness. It has, at least, passed its period of probation as far as that goes. I would however like to specify that throughout this probationary period the Bank experienced fair weather, economically speaking. Perhaps occasionally things were rather hazy, but, on the whole, we are going through a period of positive economic development. It will be much more difficult for the European Central Bank to take uncomfortable decisions, such as, for example, raising interest rates rather than lowering them, if the economic situation becomes more difficult and if actual risks to price stability arise. In the first months of its existence, the European Central Bank has earned our confidence, but if it is to be able in the future to withstand such situations, then this confidence must be systematically consolidated in the years to come and, Mr President, in that endeavour you may count on the support of my group. We are called upon to vote on a draft amendment which demands that the votes of the individual members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank should be made public. I would like to make it perfectly clear that my own group will never agree to such an amendment. Why not? Individuals sit on the Governing Council of the Bank, who are personally responsible for monetary stability and who make decisions as individuals within this Governing Council. There is not, therefore, any weighting of votes, such as there is in the Council of Ministers, since it has been determined that these are people who have to vote here as individuals. Publishing the votes could lead to a situation where there would then be national debates on the behaviour of individual members. That would be extraordinarily negative both for the European Central Bank and also for all of us. The European Central Bank has achieved some excellent work, it has earned the confidence of the citizens by dint of its work in the last few months, and this is what we are going to reflect in this resolution.

 Mr President-designate of the Commission, the new Commission is faced with a number of big tasks. We now have a joint policy on currency which is being managed by the European Central Bank. What we now need is a common economic policy. This should include consistent application of the rules on competition, including the Stability and Growth Pact. It should also include joint minimum regulations for taxation and a number of basic principles. I am convinced that this common economic policy can only succeed if it is designed in accordance with the principles of a social market economy. What we need in this connection – and this, Mr President of the Commission, is a further point to which you referred quite specifically – is a number of projects which are visible to the citizens of Europe. Firstly – and I know that there are criticisms about this – food safety is one of people’s basic concerns yet also one of the things which stops the Common Market from really working. I should like personally to encourage you, Mr President of the Commission, to take up this theme, for it seems to me to be of fundamental importance, on the one hand for our citizens but, on the other hand too, for the proper functioning of the Common Market. Secondly: the supervision of air space. For this, America has one authority, to which you also referred in one of your initial speeches. In Europe we have three authorities concerned with this issue. That is unacceptable to the airline companies and is dangerous for the citizens of Europe. This seems to me to be a second big priority. Thirdly: the further dismantling of monopolies. From the costs of telephone calls and of electricity, it appears now for the first time that dismantling monopolies is of practical value to our citizens and also entails tangible advantages. I think this ought to encourage us to go further down this road, that is to say, in the fields of postal services, energy, telecommunications and railways where similar conditions prevail. In my opinion, dismantling monopolies is to the advantage of the citizens of the European Union.

 Mr President, the reiterated support given today to both Commissioners’ negotiating positions by our group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, indicates that we too are in favour of everyone moving, when there are negotiations on agriculture, to ensure that such negotiations are actually held, and that the other participants in them should follow us in not merely announcing reforms but also implementing them. That is my first point. My second is that our present support for the mandate given to the Commission and the Council also means that we in this European Parliament have to be consistent. It is not acceptable that, in this House, we are supporting the Commission by a large majority, at the same time as, in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the same group and the same rapporteur prepare reports that are diametrically opposed to what we have said to the WTO. I would refer to the negotiations on the regional partnership agreements, in which the same principles must apply, including such things as the Singapore issues. What we see as of the utmost importance are the reciprocal opening-up of markets and, of course, preferential treatment for our ACP friends as well. We cannot, though, send out two conflicting messages, and we in the Group of the European People’s Party, perhaps along with other Members forming a majority in this House, will see to it that we remain coherent. My third point is that we in this House have to try, if we are to become active on the parliamentary front, to play a significant and leading role, which – difficult though this may be – will mean the constant involvement of our partners in the US Congress. After all, they are our principal trading partners, and we do not want to be dragged along in the wake of the Indians and the Chinese.

 Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, all of us taking part in today’s debate are agreed that we have to allow the developing countries to benefit more than they have done to date from the advantages of free and fair world trade. For that reason, they have to have better access to our market for their industrial manufactured goods and agricultural produce. In addition, though, they need to improve the knowledge they need in order to be able to get a foothold in the various markets, and their ability to actively and expertly defend their interests in WTO negotiations. We therefore strongly support the Commission in its efforts, by means of technical aid, to make it easier for these countries to become independent actors on the world market. If, though, we are not to lose sight of the fact that economic growth for all trading partners is the most important goal of WTO negotiations, it naturally follows that, in offering access to this market, we must, in the negotiations, develop an adequate strategy with regard to the developing countries so that they might have a practical awareness of the advantages of negotiating on the traditional issues of market access and competition, as well as on other issues. Whilst we have an interest, in the context of the GATS negotiations, in cautiously extending the scope of services, we insist on the cultural and organisational diversity of Europe, as reflected in the area of health, education, the audio-visual sector, and the local provision of services of general interest. We also believe that we should have no interest in making exceptions of this sort for further sectors and removing them from the scope of the market organisation for services. Europe leads the world by a long way in the provision of services. Those who, in this area, adopt a defensive and protectionist position do not recognise the strengths and competitive advantages that the European Union possesses. What has to be said as regards the body of WTO legislation is that we are meant, in particular, to develop the rules on procedure, transparency and the resolution of disputes, and that the WTO should become an independent and international jurisdiction in trade matters.

 Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express the firm support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for Mrs Mann’s report on regional free trade areas and trade strategy in the European Union. Let me add a few observations. By means of this report, we are setting out the principles by which we trade and cooperate commercially with the world’s regions. Of course, it also gives direction and a specific character to the many possibilities open to us there, which we also have at regional level. Our group works on the fundamental assumption that we are thereby able to build up free and fair global trade, and that those countries that have not so far had sufficient opportunity to engage in trade, have the chance, through the establishment of their own free trade areas, to share in this development. I see this – not only in view of what Commissioner Lamy said – as an important guide to the timeframe within which, in the aftermath of Doha, a renaissance of regional trade agreements around the world may perhaps come about. I get the impression the cooperation with certain countries – such as Singapore – can also be the key to regional free trade agreements with regions that are themselves not yet in a position, or not sufficiently advanced, to take partnership further. That is why we should be using the idea of cooperation with Singapore as the prelude to greater cooperation with ASEAN. The specific characteristics of the region present us with a broad spectrum of diverse possibilities, which must of course remain subject to the World Trade Organisation. The development of, for example, the West African market also requires, not only that we open our own market, but that West Africa should be put in a position to do better business with Central Africa and Southern Africa, as Mrs Mann pointed out in her report on South-South trade.

 I have abstained from voting on the accession of the Czech Republic. I am of the opinion that the country has not yet fulfilled all the conditions required for it to be able to accede to the EU. The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance. It is founded upon a common system of law and upon reconciliation between Europe's peoples. It is a matter of great regret to me that the Czech Government has not, as yet, changed its stance on the expulsions and continued to affirm them, in the parliamentary resolution of 24 April 2002, as being ‘unquestionable, inviolable and unchangeable’. This makes it all the more welcome that the Czech President, Vaclav Klaus, should, on 20 March 2003, state that the expulsion of Czechoslovakia's German population, and acts of violence against Germans even after the end of the war, were not acceptable from a present-day point of view. It should be added that society in both countries has seen many efforts made towards a final reconciliation. In the meantime, no change to the existing legal position has been either made or announced as a result of the President's statement. The attitude of the Czech Government and parliament is contrary to the spirit of reconciliation and of respect for human rights and the rule of law, which characterises European integration. I would like to give voice to my personal hope that the imminent enlargement of the European Union will enable the Czech Government and parliament to reconsider their position, and that the necessary gestures and actions will follow.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in this afternoon's topical and urgent debate we must also turn our attention to the war in Sudan, one of the largest and most populous countries in Africa. Civil war has been raging there for 19 years. More than two million people have lost their lives because of this war. It has brought immense suffering for the people in the south of Sudan who are fighting for cultural, political and economic independence. In the larger part of Sudan that is under government control there is no freedom of thought or religion and no possibility of peaceful assembly. Human rights continue to be treated with contempt. Government forces are blanket-bombing regions in the south with heavy civilian casualties. More than 200 death sentences have been passed by unconstitutional emergency courts in Darfur State. The oil discoveries in Sudan have not yet led to a return to peace. On the contrary, they serve to replenish the war chest of the Khartoum government. There is a ray of hope: the peace talks in Machakos in Kenya, which have led to the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement. This has been drafted, but is not yet in force. First, unimpeded access must be provided for aid consignments for the people starving in the south of Sudan. This must also lead to a permanent ceasefire on both sides, which is respected by everyone. While the situation remains critical and the peace process has not yet made sufficient progress, there is no prospect of holding the sixth meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Sudan in spring 2003. In any case, we will not go there while the current situation persists. We do hope, however, that this will be possible at a later stage. I should like to stress that Sudan's Ambassador here is doing a great deal through diplomatic channels to hasten a return to peace. We therefore call on the African countries to organise the next ACP-EU Assembly in another, more peaceful country in Africa. Mauritania, which wishes to take on this task, should be specifically encouraged to do so. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement with the ACP regions represents an attempt on the part of the European Union at putting future development cooperation with these states on a new basis, one with better prospects and greater likelihood of success. The intention is that greater economic exchange should combat poverty in the long term and eventually contribute to improving the earnings potential of people who live in the ACP States. By means of regional cooperation on their part, the ACP States are to be put in a position to develop their own functioning markets, which are necessary if there is to be greater trade with us in both goods and services. The mutual market opening, especially the opening of the great European internal market, is intended to enable them to achieve better sales in this market of their existing 
products, and perhaps also of those of higher quality yet to be developed, and thereby lay the foundations for the development of their national economies. As part of this, the EU is holding out the prospect of generous technical aid to equip the economic and administrative actors with better qualifications. The negotiations that are now getting underway should therefore focus on turning the ACP States into more effective economic partners, enabling social and cultural development, too, to be further accelerated. Mrs Boudjenah's own-initiative report would, I regret to say, need to be further substantially improved by the incorporation of various amendments if the European Union is to negotiate from a stronger position, rather than for that position to be weakened as it is at the moment. In the long term, we have to attempt to reach a realistic accommodation with the interests of the ACP States. There is little point in this if it involves what gleams through at various points in this report – attempts at levelling accusations at the Commission, which has, in recent months, stepped up dialogue with the ACP States and made proposals to them concerning their sustainable development, which have included technical aid. What matters is that the Commission, with our help, is pressing on with the creation of the new ACP economic area. Some better system must replace the outdated and inefficient system of preferences for certain imports. The rules both of the WTO and also the Cotonou Agreement should be applied, but with flexibility, and without their objectives being turned on their heads. In that respect, the position of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy – the Titley Report – is substantially in line with our way of thinking, but we demand that the opening of markets should – as provided for in the WTO rules and in the Cotonou Agreement – concentrate on goods and services. For example, there is no internal market common to both Europe and Africa, which is why there can be no generally free movement of workers either. Our demand is that liberalisation be handled flexibly, with transitional periods, but that liberalisation in important economic sectors should not be ruled out. It is also our view that investment must be well protected in order to prevent this leading to the economic standstill and retrogression now evident in policies in Zimbabwe and other countries. We have nothing against the EU providing technical assistance with assessing the impact of the establishment of free trade and economic regions in Africa, but we vigorously oppose the opening of negotiations being made dependent on this, which could lead to reform of relations between the EU and the ACP States being blocked for a long time. We do not want to develop alternative rules for our relations with the ACP States; we should abide by the WTO's rules and the rules of our own Cotonou Agreement, which should be applied flexibly and with transitional periods. We are therefore proposing amendments that, if accepted, will make it possible for us to support the report, failing which we will vote against it or abstain.

 Madam President, from the Committee on Industry, External Trade and Energy’s point of view it is of course important, now that Sapard is entering its operational phase and money is actually flowing, that that money should be used for developing the rural environment and less for agricultural production capacities. I would like to mention just two key figures: one is the 15% of agricultural production in the candidate countries, and the other is the 50% of cultivated agricultural area that can be further capitalised. So it would be wrong to continue trying to improve production structures. It would be better to create alternative sources of employment in rural areas, either crafts or small-scale industries. All in all, it is important that any possible expansion of production should not add to the already high levels of overproduction in our agriculture but that we should in that event find the right ways of developing craft trade and small-scale industry structures in the candidate countries’ agriculture and rural areas.

 Mr President, Commissioner Busquin, ladies and gentlemen, my report deals with the direct actions for the European Atomic Energy Community that are implemented and realised in the Joint Research Centre and in its installations at Ispra, Petten, Geel, Mol and Karlsruhe. This specific programme has several focal points, the policy objectives of which I would like to discuss in detail now. I will start, though, by saying a bit about education and training. Both advocates of atomic energy and its critics will surely agree that it is very important that an adequate number of young and superbly-qualified workers in the field of nuclear research in Europe should make an active contribution, by their research over the coming decades, to ensuring nuclear safety in the operational nuclear power stations and also, if need be, controlling the fuel cycle where this is a source of risk. The same applies to the safe storage of nuclear waste over the next few decades, and to its being able to be decontaminated as soon as possible. That is why it is important to maintain the Joint Research Centre's high standards and build on its research capacity by training young scientists on courses and scientific practical placements which can, inter alia, be carried on in networks of international, national and regional facilities at the various levels. More needs to be said about the general principles, but I do not want to go over the details again, as we had an in-depth discussion of them in the Sixth Framework Programme. However, there are two principles to which I want to give particular attention. The first principle is adherence to general ethical guidelines, which are also binding on EU researchers, and especially Euratom's. The public acceptability of research in the Member States plays an important part in this. You will be aware, Commissioner, of the misgivings that remain as regards some areas of scientific research, biotechnology for example. Secondly, adherence to the principle that women researchers should have equal opportunities. This relates both to their training and also to the award of important research contracts, whether these are to be carried out by researchers acting on their own or in a team. Now for the Joint Research Centre's specific objectives. I see research's principal contribution as being to the safety of the atomic power stations and of their fuel cycle. Europe's citizens can demand that the safety of atomic power stations meets the highest standards even in an enlarged European Union. The stringent western European rules, which the Member States have framed in exacting terms, but which have not to date been harmonised, must be recapitulated as part of the acquis communautaire
 and must also apply to the atomic power stations in the central and eastern European candidate countries. The Joint Research Centre's expertise and the results of its research and that of the national authorities in the European Union should be drawn on in establishing a European code of nuclear safety, which should be ratified before enlargement takes place, enabling it to be put before the candidate countries as being valid in law. The candidate countries would have to accept this code as part of the acquis communautaire
 before their accession and would then have to put it into practice. The Commission, especially Vice-President De Palacio, gave these ideas from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy a favourable reception and supported them. I also assume that you yourself will welcome these suggestions. It is, then, our desire that a Commission proposal on this topic be submitted as early as this summer. To take an example, the continued operation of the as yet unmodified atomic power station at Ignalina in Lithuania is not acceptable. Another possibility would of course be for it to be decommissioned before Lithuania joins the European Union. Taken as a whole, the European Union and the Joint Research Centre have a great deal of research capacity to hand in the field of nuclear safety. Maintaining that capacity for decades is a safety requirement for the public, who have to be able to live in safety, protected from the radioactivity from nuclear waste. The second is the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, of course, of fissile materials. The safeguards in the Euratom Treaty do indeed provide for this control, but it must also be extended, by means of the whole range of expertise within the Joint Research Centre, to the non-proliferation of fissile materials, which can of course also be used in terrorist attacks. Thefts like those which have recently occurred in Germany are a warning signal in this respect. This of course applies equally to the tracking down of stolen nuclear material and its safe storage. I will conclude by highlighting the cooperation between the Joint Research Centre and the medical sector's national and regional research centres, for example the cancer research carried on by the Institute for Transuranium Elements jointly with the German Cancer Research Centre.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, our lengthy debate today has demonstrated that one topic on which we are taking a very positive line is the role of the regions in the European Union, and this has now, of course, been recognised in the Lamassoure Report. It is planned that a special report on the role of the regions should be introduced, but I do think that our long debate might also have the result that, tomorrow morning, we get together and reconsider whether what we have just said might yet, in rather more definite form – on which point various groups have submitted amendments – be incorporated into the report. The second point I would like to address concerns the powers reserved to the EU. Mr Lamassoure quite rightly pointed out that external economic relations certainly belong in this category, being a very important area, and one in which the state of affairs is such that the Commission can arrange things properly, with the Council of Ministers helping with the orientation, but Parliament, in utter contrast to the US Congress, has almost no opportunity to influence matters. The practical cooperation that we engage in with the Commission is excellent, but I believe that things must not remain the way they are. We need to come off better out of the dividing-up of these competences, as this is a matter of particular importance to this institution of ours. Perhaps some consideration, which is certainly necessary, could yet be given to this topic as well in the Convention. In any case, I think the regions are an important subject. Let me thank Mr Lamassoure very warmly for his excellent report. We are, though, in my opinion, a bit too timid when it comes to the regions. We might be expected to do a bit more.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, transatlantic trade relations have often come under strain. We have been able to resolve many trade conflicts in a professional way that satisfied both sides, but only because we have accepted binding rules for free and fair world trade within the framework of the WTO, and also because the WTO is the only international organisation that has a dispute resolution system that also provides for sanctions. However, with the punitive tariffs the United States is now imposing on steel imports, they are abandoning the common ground that we have so far occupied under the WTO. It is extremely hard for us Europeans to understand these measures, as they primarily hit our steel products. Almost half of Europe's steel exports to the USA are affected by these punitive tariffs. What is more, we Europeans can expect to suffer twice over from the American measures, because of diverted trade flows. That is something we are not prepared to accept. We will not support the Americans' game of playing off their workers' interests against those of our own workers. Over the past few years, the European steel industry has had great success in carrying out restructuring, but this has involved enormous job losses, making this a very painful process. It must be clear for the United States that it is not in their interest to undermine confidence in the WTO's system of multilateral rules and its impartial conflict resolution system at the beginning of the Doha Round. In the case of bilateral contacts with the USA, the European Union needs to firmly demonstrate to our American partner that this serious and unwarranted interference in free world trade will not be simply accepted, and that we will make use of the mechanisms currently at our disposal. Why is the Commission not considering using the mechanisms available to it in accordance with the decision of the WTO panel on US export promotion and taking countermeasures? I believe it is now necessary for us to make that clear to the Unites States.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would actually like just to further underline Mrs Maes' impressive description of the sufferings of the population, but I also wish to address a few other aspects, which perhaps have rather more to do with organisation and also with the political environment. Organisational matters first: we hope that ECHO, the European Union with its aid, will no longer be hindered by anybody and will be able to get aid to the spot as quickly as possible. We also hope that this applies not only to the city of Goma, but also to the area surrounding it, including Bukavu, where there are also refugees, and Rwanda and Burundi too, where refugees are also scattered. We must give this aid, and quickly, to all those persons affected. That is my first point. The second point is that this again throws the spotlight on the weakness of the organised state and on its absence in the Congo. The peace process needs to be firmly supported as soon as possible. We have to help the various parties to see reason as soon as possible in order to facilitate reconstruction in the Congo, so that administrative, and also democratic, structures may be restored and so that this great country's descent into chaos may be halted. A great task is before us, and the exemplary aid we are currently able to provide is perhaps an incentive for the various participants in the conflict to listen to the European Community and avail themselves of our mediation.

Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, the new agreement on cooperation and development, the Cotonou Agreement, constitutes a significantly improved framework for cooperation with the ACP States. It is an agreement that we emphatically support, one in which the significant improvements in terms of content and policy originated in proposals by Parliament. We do not, therefore, share either the rapporteur's highly critical assessment or his reasons for it. Indeed, we take the view that it is something of a caricature. Let me, in response to the rapporteur's analysis, list three points in favour. Firstly, the establishment of a parliamentary assembly represents genuine progress, in that, after an appropriate preparatory period, ACP States will be represented only by freely elected parliamentarians, rather than by ambassadors, as is still to some extent the case. This principle must not only be incorporated into the new rules of procedure of our Joint Assembly, but also put into practice. We will vote against the admittance of any ACP ambassador if, for example, he displaces freely elected African delegates. The second is the regional approach to cooperation, also originating in proposals by this Parliament, which puts an end to economic parochialism in Africa. Our cooperative effort must in future be focused on regional free trade and cooperation agreements. We insist that our regional parliamentary cooperation should begin on the ground this very year, for example subsequent to our Southern African meeting in Cape Town in March or our meeting with ECOWAS in the course of the year. Thirdly, we support the reinforcement of the clause on democracy and human rights, which we believe must be speedily implemented. Let me mention only Nigeria, Togo and Zimbabwe as examples of why this is so. We hope that this will bring about genuine parliamentary partnership with our fellow parliamentarians in Africa and elsewhere in the ACP countries.

Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, West Africa is in the process of structuring its cooperation in the form of a common market. It is creating common regional, economic and political structures. If everything goes according to plan, we shall be able to talk and hold discussions with parliamentarians from the new West African regional assembly of the regional parliament at next year's ACP assembly. We shall be able to organise our practical cooperation. But there are a few serious constraints, one of the most serious being the authoritarian regime of President Eyadéma in Togo. We are calling for the immediate release and restoration of the democratic rights of Yawowi Agboyibo, who was arbitrarily arrested and is now serving a six-month sentence which he has done nothing to deserve. Having served over five months of his sentence, the president should release him without further ado. We are not calling for a pardon. He did nothing wrong, he merely highlighted abuse in the system and he should be released from prison as quickly as possible. We are devastated that the attempt by our President, Nicole Fontaine, to meet President Eyadéma in Paris last week and ask him, as a favour, to arrange for this release, proved fruitless. Eyadéma is playing cat and mouse with us. We can no longer allow provision to be made for more development aid here. We support the Commission in suspending development aid. But we hope that we shall soon be able to provide further humanitarian aid for the people of Togo and we also hope that democratisation will continue next year, despite all the obstacles, and that it will be possible to hold parliamentary elections and then presidential elections a year later. We call on Eyadéma to put an end to this farce once and for all. (Applause)

Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say how grateful and obliged we are to the Commission and the Council for the excellent preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Qatar. Commissioner Lamy, you and your colleagues achieved something extraordinary in starting from an extremely difficult situation just before Doha and nonetheless, by the end of the meeting, getting all the subjects wanted by the European Union into the programme for the round beginning in 2002, this despite the usual, and largely unjustified, attacks by India and the Cairns Group countries on the European Union. Essential elements of our pre-conference resolution were included. Two weeks later, in Accra, I saw for myself the pride of Ghana's government representatives in pointing out that Africa had played an independent role this time, and this could, among other things, be attributed to good preparatory work by the European Union and in particular by Commissioner Lamy. The developing countries, particularly Africa, are now and for the future fully involved in negotiations, and this was also one of our main demands. The political declaration on TRIPS represents a respectable result for the African mediators, something that you have already mentioned this morning, Commissioner Lamy. The demands of the developing countries and of the Africans – ranging from the need for comprehensive technical aid to the Cotonou Agreement's exceptions up to 2008 – have very largely been met. The core European demands will, though, also be included in the new round of negotiations. I do not need to go into the details again. What is important is that we in the European Union can input our conceptions of a socially and environmentally responsible market economy into the system of free and fair world trade and that they can also, slowly, prevail. I also believe, though, that there is still more that we can do to make the WTO more democratic. Mr Lamy, you too have referred to the need for us to achieve the creation of a parliamentary assembly. We in this Parliament should retain our leadership role and also ask the Commission to continue its financial support for us, so that we can especially involve the representatives of the African parliaments. Let me return to a point made in this morning's debate. One of our colleagues, Mrs Lucas, pointed out that the outcome was poor, indeed unacceptable. I thought, here comes a European justification of European interests, but she only referred to India and certain NGOs, which... (The President cut the speaker off)

Mr President, President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed, by our unanimous adoption of the Kaufmann report, our ability, in the very short time available to us, to act in concert and respond to important reform proposals from the Commission, on which we will be able to take up a position either today or tomorrow, just in time for the European Summit at Laeken. Let me just pick out a few points from the Kaufmann report and highlight the following: Mr Prodi, we are delighted to learn that you are sticking with the joint working party proposed in October. What matters now is that we get it moving quickly and start collaborating appropriately on the subject matter in hand. We, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats insist in any case on an early start being made on this work. We are glad that the Commission of the European Union has given up developing what would have been, in effect, its own administrative structures right down through the regions, towns and local communities, as we read about, for example, in preliminary drafts of its White Paper. It is also our opinion that it is fundamentally unacceptable that the Commission should adopt a method of open coordination, bypassing its co-legislator Parliament, with guidelines sanctioned only by the Council of Ministers and with the Commission using the financial reins of the programmes to set their general course. Here, too, the co-legislator needs to be involved. We urge you to undertake an in-depth reform of the comitological procedure. It is not acceptable that, with the help of the national bureaucracies, Parliament's legislative prerogative should be made null and void by means of implementing provisions whose content, purpose and extent are not laid down in advance. We also demand that European agencies be kept to a minimum. May we remind you that the Commission and the European Parliament are born allies when it comes to the promotion of European integration and action in the interests of Europe's citizens? The transposition of European legislation requires at every level its own culture of public administration, which must also embrace the application of European rules through the authorities in the Member States. There is an urgent need for appropriate instruction and training of civil servants at these levels.

Mr President, Commissioner Lamy deserves our gratitude for referring to the much-needed institutional reinforcement of the role of the European Parliament in European trade policy. I wish to ask you Madam President-in-Office of the Council, whether you can support this position when you are assembling your papers for the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference and, firstly, for the Convention for which we are all striving? It is there that the breakthrough should at last occur, so that the European Parliament can draw even in institutional terms with the American Senate and House of Representatives. In the next few years, the WTO will, through the imminent accession of China and Taiwan – both of which have long been important trading partners of Europe – and the eventual accession of Russia, gain a global dimension, giving it an even greater worldwide representative role and presenting it with new challenges. To achieve this, it will have to adapt its structures and change the way it works. With Qatar, there is the additional factor that we must make a start and genuinely involve all the developing countries, not only the representatives of the least developed, in the negotiations. The technical aid which the EU and the other industrialised countries are called upon to provide is crucial for these countries' future real involvement in the decision-making process. The WTO must, however, also increase its efficiency despite these changes and become more transparent and more readily understood by the world's citizens. How will the WTO harmonise its new, strengthened universality with the need to become even more efficient and make markets more open? Our resolution attempts to reconcile these two requirements, although surely incompletely as yet. We Europeans must contribute our environmental legislation, our regulations on food safety, our multifunctional agriculture and our social security legislation as expressions of a tangible European reality. Now, some weeks after 11 September, it is particularly important, partly as a response to terrorism, that we, the EU and, particularly, the European Parliament, continue without distraction on our way towards greater openness and democracy in the WTO and resolutely set about the necessary reforms. We need to promote fair and freer world trade rather than seal ourselves off by means of protectionism and fall back upon national markets. We must also strive to realise soon the central proposition of the European Parliament – the establishment of an effective parliamentary assembly for the WTO, to be the world's mouthpiece in trading matters. We therefore need representatives of the American Congress in Doha as well. We are relying on the parliaments of the industrialised states, of the emergent countries and of all the developing countries. May we ask, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if you, at the end of your presidency of the Council, could give your support to this proposal, which we must implement as soon as possible? We support Commissioner Lamy's efforts at using our cooperative structures to involve Africa in particular – Africa, that continent which is largely forgotten by world trade – more intensively in dialogue on the subject of a parliamentary assembly. Our seminar on 12 April was the first example of a successful conference on trade, democracy and development to involve our friends from Africa alongside the representatives of the industrialised countries in America, Europe and Asia. Technical support from the Commission and our parliamentary budget played an important part in this.

 Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, in the 51 years of its existence, since the beginning of the European unification process and since the Robert Schuman Declaration, the European Union can lay claim to a considerable success story. In addition to establishing the common market, the single currency and the beginnings of a common foreign and security policy, we have also become an area of peace, justice and security, and in this we are a model for many regions of the world. But why is it that our citizens do not see the actions of the various institutions of the European Union in a proper light, as we might expect? Why is it that they so often fail to evoke a positive response? The question that immediately comes to mind is of course why the European Union has such a poor external image and why it is so bad at initiating and implementing its policies. These questions of course provide the basis for the Commission's White Paper of 25 July of this year, and we are delighted that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is here to discuss this issue with us for the second time today and has just offered us cooperation within an interinstitutional working party. I think this is an excellent suggestion that we should accept promptly and in a constructive spirit. Another question is why our public image in the EU Member States is so patchy – I do not wish to say dismal – yet it cannot really be said that the European Union stumbles from one failure to the next. I think that a key point here is what the Commission says at the beginning of the White Paper: it should go back to concentrating on its core activities. The Commission should not allow itself to get tangled up in a mass of individual proposals and decisions so that in terms of overall policy strategy you cannot see the wood for the trees. As I see it, there are a few more questions that we need to consider in some depth before we will find the appropriate answers. We certainly recognise that the Commission – and I think that all the institutions need to do this – has subjected and is continuing to subject its actions to a critical review process, after which it can then adopt any changes necessary after discussion with us. We also support the Commission's intention to focus on particular areas, but we have to say that the Commission should in that case undertake appropriate work with the press. It should make it very clear to the public what European legislation consists of and how it has to be implemented. There is also a second important issue here. There is no point in the Commission setting up its own substructures in various fields, and I believe that it has in fact largely ceased to do this. It should make use of existing public agencies at national, regional and local level to implement Community legislation. There is no need for the Commission to arrange direct involvement in every local district and in every medium-sized town. Although it is important to keep citizens informed, suitable forms of interaction should be used. Framework legislation produced by the Commission should provide for implementation at regional and national level, and it seems to me that the Commission's first proposal in the 25 July White Paper blurs the distinction between the various levels too much. So what is needed? Joint regulation? Open coordination? To what extent are European agencies needed? We need to address all these questions in our interinstitutional working party.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by drawing your attention to the fact that the conclusions of the Wiersma report on the possible accession of Slovakia to the European Union have the full backing of the PPE group. Slovakia is an example of how, with political will, a country initially at a disadvantage, in this case a country which, under the Meciar regime, lost nearly four years compared with everyone else, can catch up with the other countries negotiating for accession and join with them in resolving problems quickly. What is most impressive is that Slovakia has successfully stabilised its economy over recent years and has started and, in many cases, completed comprehensive structural reforms, including privatising the banks. However, the European Union also needs Slovakia to accede, lying as it does between Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, because it will be easier to guarantee an area of freedom and security in an enlarged European Union along a continuous external border. However, Slovakia will only be able to accede quickly if it is equally quick in implementing government and administrative reform. This includes making the judiciary independent, introducing effective financial controls and reforming the communes and local authorities, all within the next few weeks. This will also indirectly guarantee the involvement of national minorities, especially the Hungarians, in over 500 communities. Slovakia should therefore keep up its resolve to deal with outstanding accession problems in liaison with the Commission and the European Parliament, so as to pave the way for fast accession to the European Union.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the WTO dispute between the European Union and the United States in the Havana Club case, in other words the dispute regarding section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act, highlights the need for our Parliament to be informed and involved by the Council at crucial junctures in the pursuit of our common trade policy. Unlike the Commission, the Council failed to take steps to inform Parliament fully and promptly of the formulation of a common position, as it ought to have done. The Council would normally apply Article 300(2) and the last sentence of Article 300(3), mutatis mutandis
, and brief us on such important matters. The point is that the Council, by persisting with its current practice, is evading its parliamentary accountability to the Member States and to ourselves. This situation cannot be tolerated indefinitely, and we demand changes. In the present case, as Erika Mann has said, the absence of information from the Council has prompted a host of individual expressions of opinion in the European Parliament. Most of these, I believe, have been inconsistent with the prevailing view in the Committee on External Trade, and their cumulative effect has been to undermine seriously the Council position in Parliament. In other words, by failing to provide information, the Council has sown the seeds of uncertainty and has given our trading partners – in this case the United States – an opportunity, if not to weaken the position adopted by the Commission then certainly to present it as rather less clear-cut than it actually is. I therefore believe that there is ultimately no alternative to a judicious change of procedure. In calling for change, we are merely exercising our parliamentary power of scrutiny. We are responsible as a Parliament for scrutinising the implementation of the common trade policy, and we should be better equipped in future to perform that function. Although the Commission keeps us informed, it is not enough for the Council, as it did through the Swedish Minister of Industry and Commerce, for example, to come to us and hold general discussions with us without involving us in consultation mechanisms such as the EU Trade Ministers’ informal talks. Under the Portuguese Presidency, for instance, we were invited to take part in these talks. I believe the Swedish Presidency still has a pledge to honour in this respect. As spokesman for the PPE Group, I should like to reaffirm emphatically that we do approve of the way in which the Commission has acted on the provision of information as well as in defending the interests of the European Union against the United States in the dispute-settlement procedure, as has now been shown. The Council, however – as I have already said – failed to inform us about this common position, contrary to the undertaking given by Mr Pagrotsky. I therefore believe that the practical conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Council should show, through its actions as well as its words, that it accepts Parliament as an equal partner on issues of common trade policy, particularly by using the proper legal basis for all the measures with which it implements the common trade policy, in other words Article 133 of the EC Treaty, which is now applicable in conjunction with Article 3, as well as Article 300(2) and (3) – new numbering – the latter being applicable by analogy, given the necessary will to cooperate. Secondly, the Council should enable the Commission to seek the opinion of Parliament prior to the conferment of a negotiating mandate, as in this Havana Club case, for example. We could then begin a dialogue and bring it to a satisfactory conclusion. We also believe there is a need for an interinstitutional agreement on this matter, like the one we concluded with the Commission, until such times as the Treaty is finally amended too. Lastly, I must urge the Council, when it next revises the Treaty of Nice, which I hope it will do at the forthcoming Laeken summit, to reword Article 133 so as to involve the European Parliament in the framing of policy and the negotiation and conclusion of agreements on important trade issues. This proposal is contained in paragraph 28 of the Mendéz de Vigo and Seguro report on the conclusions to be drawn from the Treaty of Nice, and we shall insist on the earliest possible introduction of this amendment to the EC Treaty.

Mr President, since Mr Danielsson addressed me directly, I should like to reply to two points. Firstly, let me express my thanks to the Swedish Presidency for the recent invitation from the Swedish Ambassador in Brussels to informal talks with the members of the ‘Article 133’ Committee. This, however, was a cocktail party, not a meeting, and I pointed out to several people, including the chairman of the ambassadors’ group, that it was perhaps not an ideal arrangement to hold the event on a Thursday evening, when the Members of Parliament were returning to their constituencies at the end of a plenary week. But these things can be rectified, and another weekday could be chosen next time. That is the first point. Thank you for the initiative of your diplomats. Secondly, you said that things will have to be changed – not now but in 2004. But please remember, Mr Danielsson, that we now have a round of international trade negotiations in Qatar, and we have a ministerial meeting at which the U.S. Congress will be represented. The U.S. Congress, however, has not yet approved the ‘fast track’ proposal. This means that the U.S. Congress currently has direct participatory powers in Qatar. We in the European Parliament are no longer receiving sufficient information from you. Compare your conduct, the conduct of the Swedish Presidency, with that of the members of the U.S. Administration, who now speak to the Members of Congress virtually on a daily basis, week in, week out. You no longer have any national control; you no longer have any European control … (The President cut the speaker off)

 Madam President, Commissioner Busquin, you are calling for greater integration of research activities at European level on the one hand and at national, regional and international level on the other. There is a very typical example in my region, namely the cooperation between the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg and the Transuran Institute in Karlsruhe. The question arises: should we not in future bring in a European integration week highlighting good examples, and will integration not also require financial assistance from the European Union, which could be used to support particularly promising joint research ventures?

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Mr President-in-Office, the Treaty of Nice fails to go far enough not only in institutional matters but in a number of important spheres. Take the very topical example of the common European trade policy. It is based on common principles and there is in principle majority voting. The small extension now being made in Article 113, Services and Intellectual Property, is counteracted by six exceptions and three proposals to the Council itself not to go beyond the spheres assigned to it. At the same time, the consultation of the European Parliament provided for up until now is eliminated with the result that today, unlike in the USA, there is no possibility for Parliament to play a formal part in Europe, either at national or European level, in broad areas of trade policy. We therefore demand, as clearly formulated in item 27 of the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report, that the European Parliament be fully involved in the common trade and external economic relations policy, both in the framing of policy and in the negotiation and conclusion of agreements – and here with codecision – because if the national parliaments no longer have any powers over common trade policy it is urgently necessary for the European Parliament to take their place as an element of democratic control and that formal provision be made for it to do so. Otherwise, when it comes to negotiations with the World Trade Organisation we as the European Parliament will be faced with an American Congress with full powers to act and able to give guidance to its administration whereas the European Parliament still has no formal powers in this respect. I therefore call on the Swedish Presidency to show the way forward so that the Belgian Presidency can get an effective revision of Article 133 adopted by the Council in Laeken when it comes to rectifying the Treaty of Nice.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Seattle showed that for the WTO, the USA is no longer the only major power. As the European Union, we face the United States on an equal footing. The same applies to the Asian states, and the developing countries play an important role as well. With almost a 40% share of trade and services, the European Union has become an important negotiating partner worldwide, which bears responsibility in all areas of the WTO and which should involve all the industrialised and developing countries in this process. We must do justice to this responsibility by making the European Parliament's voice heard at an early stage, and by being present to shape the focus of the current negotiations. So today, we want to fulfil this task and, with our recommendations on the WTO's Built-In Agenda, make our position clear to the citizens of Europe early on. We want these recommendations to be taken into account at the WTO's interim review in April 2001. Our individual demands are in line with our proposals at the multilateral round in Seattle. As that round failed to achieve a result, we now wish to clarify and update our position by putting forward these recommendations on agriculture, services, and specific intellectual property issues. Today's debate will not include the full range of issues such as environmental protection, health policy, competition, minimum social standards, etc. We will be clarifying our position on those areas in a series of further recommendations in a few months' time, but certainly before the new multilateral round opens in Qatar at the beginning of November. So I would ask my colleagues from the other interested committees to be patient until then. I would like to mention Mrs Flemming in particular, who has put forward some very interesting proposals. They will undoubtedly play a key role in the committee responsible, as well as in Parliament, during the next round. This report on the Built-In Agenda is only intended to deal with the three areas, not the package as a whole. Let me pick out a few points. Firstly, regarding agriculture: as outlined in the Council's mandate of December 2000, we want to achieve a balance between trade and non-trade concerns in agriculture. For example, structural funding for rural development belongs in the green box
 and thus ceases to be the subject of wrangling within the WTO. We agree with the Commission's courageous proposal, which had our full support and which led to the Council of Ministers' recent decision to remove all trade barriers on all products from the world's 48 least developed countries. This is a signal for a close partnership with the developing countries within the WTO framework, a signal which does not diminish in value even in light of the transitional arrangements for ‘sensitive’ products. We also advocate, however, the vigorous defence of the existing European model of agriculture based on multifunctionality. The precise details are set out in the report. Regarding services: we wish to achieve further progressive liberalisation of the trade in services. This must not be a one-way street for the industrialised nations, however, but must include the developing countries as well. As regards the protection of intellectual property, we want biodiversity to be respected, and we are also seeking a guarantee that in the field of plant innovations, the economic benefit will be shared appropriately between the donor country and the party wishing to commercialise the material. We are seeking greater transparency in the preparation and conduct of ministerial meetings. Procedures relating to composition and reporting mechanisms, and to the frequency and timing of formal WTO meetings, must be subordinate to this goal. In the interests of greater democratisation and improved scrutiny of the WTO mechanisms, we are calling for the speedy creation of a parliamentary dimension, in which the various regions of the world, and the parliaments and parliamentarians involved in the decision-making process in the field of trade, could discuss the reforms of the WTO and introduce and implement effective scrutiny of the WTO bodies.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, greater power for the European Union to act in the field of foreign trade and payments is one of the fundamental demands of the European Parliament and of the Commission too, as you, President Prodi, emphatically underlined earlier today. Although we now see the French Presidency, Mr President of the Council, playing a decisive part here, it is also plainly evident that we are still at square one today, just a few days before the IGC ministerial meeting. You bear responsibility for the success of this project; you, the President-in-Office of the Council, also have the power to make things happen. We should include not only trade in goods but also the corresponding trade in services, as well as investments, intellectual property and competition, in the range of matters which are subject to qualified-majority voting in the Council of Ministers and amend Article 133(1) of the Treaty accordingly. That is our basic demand. We in the European Union account for 40% of trade in goods and services in the world, compared with the US share of only 20%. We therefore bear a worldwide burden of responsibility for the establishment of more open markets as well as having the opportunity to export our technological systems and services to many countries of the world. I have seen at first hand in our Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the great majority of government representatives support the reinforcement of the role played by the European Union and are demanding that. Apparently, however, it is the French Government which is needlessly stonewalling on this issue. Let us not forget that France, as a major economic power in the European Union, benefits directly whenever the EU is able to speak with one voice and successfully defend its interests in negotiations with representatives of the world's major trading areas – the United States, Canada and the countries of Asia. We proceed on the assumption that France will defend with justifiable vigour her own vital interests with regard to her cultural identity, which is also related to the cultural identity of Europe as a whole. We are urging a compromise, with provision for unanimity where these interests are affected, but I believe there is some way to go before we can start to move forward.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Duhamel report has provided us, the European Parliament, with the opportunity, barely two months before the European Council in Nice, to reiterate our position on the further development of the European Union, and in so doing to take account of the need for the EU to become primed for action on the enlargement front over the next few years, as well as to demonstrate to our citizens the medium-term prospects of the European Union. Commissioner Barnier, you made this point a moment ago, and rightly so. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will therefore use its large majority to vote in favour of Olivier Duhamel’s outstanding report, which focuses on the essential aspects. During the first phase, we will need a constitutional treaty that will amalgamate the existing foundations of the Treaties of the European Union currently in force, in a clear and comprehensible manner. At the same time, however, this constitutional treaty should be elaborated in such a way that it renders the common values of the European Union comprehensible, incorporates the fundamental rights of the European citizens laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and improves the composition, role, and modus operandi 
of the European Union’s bodies, looking beyond the Nice Summit, thereby improving their efficiency. What this European constitution will also need to do is clearly establish the distribution of tasks between the Member States and the European Union, inject the dynamism of European integration into those areas where it is badly needed, and provide for joint action to be taken, for example in the sphere of foreign and security policy. It is also important, in this context, to respect and safeguard the lowest layer of democracy and local self-administration in the EU Member States. We must not, as has already happened with a number of directives, end up with an interplay of European and national bureaucracies which restricts and overrides the citizen’s ability to shape policy at a local level. We therefore propose that local self-administration should form an integral part of a future European constitution and would urge you to endorse this proposed amendment.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ‘from problem child to model pupil’, that is how we could characterise the determination of the Slovakian government and the Slovakian parliament to swiftly tread the path to EU membership, and to spend the past two years making every available effort to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. We hope that the Slovakian parliament and the government will pursue this course resolutely and find the patience they need to overcome opposition and strengthen the Slovakian people on their way to Europe. It follows from this though, that there must also be privatisation and restructuring of the economy. The banking and financial sector must be completely reformed, and fiscal consolidation must be continued. The dialogue between the social partners, the other groups within civil society, the government and parliament will play an important – and as we see it – positive part in the process. The small and medium-sized enterprises must be the main beneficiaries of economic diversification. In the long term, Slovakia should earn an ever-increasing amount of its foreign currency from economic sectors that have nothing to do with the processing of oil, or weapons production. We welcome the fact that there is now close cooperation between Hungary and the Slovak Republic. We are particularly delighted that Slovakia has made a start on granting the Hungarian and the other minorities rights, which are gradually approaching the standards prescribed by the Council of Europe. It is important for this condition to be fulfilled if Slovakia’s membership of the European Union is to proceed smoothly. Incidentally, the Slovakian government is making remarkable efforts to modernise the state apparatus and to bring on the peripheral regions. We have noted with satisfaction that the Slovakian parliament is conscious of what needs to be done for Slovakia to be able to accede to the EU, and has set about trying to accomplish this systematically and rapidly. We are also aware that, being a transit country in Central Europe for those on their way to Western Europe, the Slovak Republic has a special duty to take a pro-active stance against trafficking in human beings, and to fight corruption and organised crime with even more determination than before, and we have noted that the executive judiciary has been further strengthened by recent changes in the law. On a final note, allow me, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, to thank our rapporteur, Mr Wiersma, for his excellent and comprehensive report, and to assure him of my group’s support.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China was yet another of our trading partners to realise during negotiations in Beijing that the European Union has specific, independent weight as a major global trading area. The Commission represented coherent positions on the part of the European Union with the support of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and implemented many of them. Competition and the reciprocal opening of markets, freedom of establishment and in the provision of services, intellectual property rights, environmental protection and partnership for sustainable development are just a few examples. For the rest, our position is based on the principles of free and fair global trade and is shaped by the European model of a social, ecological market economy, many fundamental points of which are already included in European framework legislation. We expressly thank Commissioner Lamy and his team – and I expressly include his predecessor Sir Leon Brittan here – for the excellent result; the Commission negotiated successfully and competently; China has moved a long way towards opening its markets and basically accepts the rules specified by the World Trade Organisation in 1994 and further developed since. There is no need to outline the specific successes in detail. They range from reductions in customs tariffs, from starting rates of often over 40% to an average of 10%, to the opening of import and export monopolies via joint ventures in the service sector, trade chains and medium-term freedom of establishment for independent European undertakings. So the results are clear. But integrating China into world trade also means ensuring that it is in a position to respect and apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation, act as a responsible partner and take on new responsibilities. We therefore thank Commissioner Patten for his assurance that technical assistance, training for China’s specialists and for those responsible for the new chapter in cooperation will be coordinated with the United States. But we feel that something else is needed; greater understanding on China’s part of the European Union’s commercial position on the reciprocal opening of the markets. We are counting on China’s supporting the European Union’s proposals for a comprehensive new round of WTO talks in the short term. In the long term, we would stress the implications of a more intensive trading partnership with China for peace in Asia, Europe and the world as a whole. We feel that China will, in the long term, see the obvious need for the rapid economic and social development of China to be fostered within a framework of open markets and democratic reform. On behalf of the PPE Group, therefore, I welcome the successful outcome of negotiations with China and call on the Council to put this result in political order so that the European Parliament is able to adopt this important decision.

 Mr President, the excellent report by our colleague, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, on supplementary assistance for the budget of Moldova gives us a rare opportunity to cast our eyes on this small country on the periphery of the European Union, on its economic development and political orientation. The people once again find themselves living in poverty. The average monthly per capita income in Moldova is only approximately EUR 30. Privatisation is making only slow headway and so far the country has not managed to entirely resolve the problem of integrating its Russian minority groups. It has still not achieved monetary or budgetary stability and Russian occupation troops are still stationed in part of the country, in Trans-Dnestr. For days now, there has been a very real risk of all the lights going out in Moldova. The Russian energy company Gazprom suspended gas supplies because Moldova could not pay its bills in German Marks and US dollars. So we are quite literally witnessing this country’s almost desperate fight for economic survival and political existence. Geographically, Moldova is a narrow strip of land between Ukraine and Romania. Many young Moldovans are looking towards the European Union. Some are studying at our universities and technical colleges thanks to funding from the European Union and its Member States. At home, most of them want Moldova to become more open to the European Union. How can we, the European Parliament, make it easier for Moldova to become more open? The macro-economic financial assistance, which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats firmly support, is an important step towards building up the necessary confidence in the Moldovan administration system and thereby consolidating its budget. Moreover, the aid under the TACIS programmes must concentrate more on vocational training, education and improving the totally outmoded transport, communications and energy infrastructure. Small crafts and services businesses can only be started up if there are prospects of improving the framework conditions for competition and investment, which is only feasible in the long term with the help of the European Union. But Moldova must also know where it wants to go. Does it want to remain in a state of insecurity because it relies so heavily on cheap Russian raw materials, which it cannot even pay for yet, and also remain incapable of reform in many areas, which would mean tying its long-term future to the imponderables of Russian economic and social development? Or does it want to follow the example of Romania and resolutely tread the long and difficult road of economic reforms and closer cooperation with the European Union? In that case, it also deserves stronger support on our part. That support must be conditional on a radical modernisation of its economy and administration. We hope Moldova will opt for renewal and for Europe.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the long run, we cannot swim against the tide of free and fair world trade with the common organisation of the market in bananas. We ourselves also have to observe the rules that we signed up to when the WTO was founded. By infringing them and thus triggering sanctions, we are already blocking access to the major US markets – and also increasingly to Latin America’s markets – for whole sectors of our economy. We will be jointly responsible for large numbers of lay-offs in these sectors if we as the European Union do not change our stance. That is why we – and I am now speaking on behalf of a significant minority in the PPE Group, which could be a majority the next time – support the Commission’s position. Following a transitional period, a tariff of EUR 275 per tonne is to be introduced for bananas from third countries, from which bananas from ACP countries would be exempt. This will protect the essential interests of the ACP producer countries. However, the Achilles’ heel of the Commission’s proposals is the lack of sufficient protection for the interests of banana producers within the European Union, essentially in the peripheral regions and the overseas departments. They are up in arms about this omission – particularly our French colleagues, and I assume the same applies to Portugal and Spain. Commissioner Fischler, things are not as the officials in your directorate-general perhaps claim – and I would also like to address this comment to Mr Lamy. The arrangements for EU banana producers are not as good as they might be. There is still a need for a political compromise here. The structural measures envisaged in Title III of the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas need to be considerably strengthened. If we made just 10-20% of the total punitive tariffs of EUR 400 million, that is to say EUR 40-80 million, available as agriculture budget appropriations, instead of diverting it for other purposes, we could help our banana producers a great deal. I call on the Commission to improve the structural measures and so open up the way for a compromise which is fundamentally in accordance with your proposals.

Mr President, one of the most important goals of the European Union’s Mediterranean policy is to make a positive contribution to the peace process between Israel and the Arab states, and in particular between Israel and the authorities of the Palestinian autonomous area, and to give this process our energetic support, wherever possible. In economic terms, this means that according to the existing agreement, Europe’s markets are open to products from Israel and from the Palestinians’ autonomous area. Furthermore, exports from the territory of the State of Israel and the current Palestinian territories to the European Union receive preferential treatment from the European Union.  Provision has not yet been made in the strictly legal sense for preferential arrangements of this kind to be enjoyed by occupied areas which have yet to be assigned definitively to the national territory of one country or the other, under the terms of the peace process and a new border settlement, and these arrangements have yet to be specified in detail. We agree with the Commission on this. Therefore, it would make good sense now for Israel to guarantee the legally irreproachable application of this concrete preferential arrangement on its national territory, and for the Palestinians to do the same in respect of their interim territory. However, we are also in favour of allowing the direct representatives of these occupied territories enough time to reach a negotiated settlement, which is something you mentioned Commissioner.   Ultimately, all producers, be they Israeli or Palestinian, should be afforded easier access to the European Union market once the territorial issues have been conclusively resolved, which will come step-by-step with the construction of a future Palestinian state. Therefore, the European Union should help to move the process on, and not behave in such a way as to exacerbate the situation, i.e. by apportioning blame to one party, which achieves nothing. And so, on behalf of the vast majority of the PPE-DE Group, I urge Israel, the Palestinians – and President Arafat’s stance is an encouraging sign in this respect – and the Commission, to step up the direct exploratory talks, so as to settle this as yet unresolved trade issue between the European Union, on the one hand, and Israel and the Palestinian autonomous authorities, on the other.   Therefore, with your permission, I would like to encourage the Commission – Mr Vitorino and Mr Lamy – to continue to support the peace process by taking a discreet but cooperation-orientated line, supporting the legitimate interests of Palestinian producers – as Parliament has done for ten years now – and, at the same time, building on our close trade ties with Israel and its producers.

 Mr President, Commissioner, Tajikistan is not only the poorest of all the countries formed from the Soviet Union, it has also been the one to suffer the most on account of the turmoil caused by tribal feuding, which ultimately escalated into civil war. The country failed to grasp how to employ the financial aid provided so far in a targeted manner. The situation has only calmed down to some extent over the last few months, once the warring parties had ceased hostilities and resolved that their next step would be to form a coalition government. General free elections are set for March 2000. The international donor community, which includes Swiss organisations for the most part, is now prepared to carry on where it left off delivering financial aid, but with certain provisos. Now that the situation has abated and there are more favourable prospects for future progress overall, the Savary report now attempts to provide renewed support for the macroeconomic financial aid for this country in the form of loans. We hope that this will make it sufficiently clear to Tajikistan that it needs to improve its state machinery by embracing democratic development and undertaking the necessary reforms. However, the financial aid in the form of loans should only be granted if there is a real possibility of the European Union being able to properly monitor the situation, if the process of national reconciliation continues and the elections, in particular the parliamentary elections set for March, are free and democratic. As Mr Savary rightly said, this is also what we aim to achieve with proposed Amendments Nos 8 and 9, to which we give our unequivocal support. If Tajikistan’s creditworthiness is to be restored, then the proposal in Budget 2000 is also to be welcomed. The rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has just confirmed to me that as far as this is concerned, a commentary is to provide for a particular form of financial aid to be made available again under the TACIS programme. On a final note, I would like to say that the PPE group supports this report notwithstanding all the associated risks. It represents a renewed, hopefully successful attempt to resume and promote economic and technical cooperation with Tajikistan.

 Mr President, Commissioner, no result is better than a bad result. That is the conclusion which we too believe should be drawn from the unsuccessful negotiations in Seattle. May I thank you, Commissioner Lamy, and the entire Commission Delegation for being so well prepared and for leading the negotiations so skilfully. By taking such a dynamic lead – in close cooperation with the European Parliament Delegation – the Commission showed, with its comprehensive negotiating strategy, that it had set the course for a possible success. The poor level of preparation on the part of the WTO, but also the tactics of the United States and other countries, did not, however, permit a successful conclusion. It is with satisfaction that we also not only take note of your support – which you have just reiterated – for the WTO parliamentary assembly which we have called for, but also express the hope that you will give us practical support as far as those responsible in the WTO are concerned in our efforts to make this a reality. In this process, cooperation between the European Union, North America, Mercosur, ASEAN and the ACP countries should allow this parliamentary assembly to be organised effectively, with the regional groupings able to play an important role in the interests of greater efficacy. Now, what needs to be done in the months, and perhaps in the year, ahead? We too believe that we need to keep the global negotiating strategy and consolidate it further in the coming months. We need to open and pursue an active dialogue with those countries, including the newly industrialised and developing countries, whose positions still diverge widely from ours. Our chances of winning over these countries should be all the greater if we remain consistent. The focus here should be on the following core areas of trade in goods and services: further reductions in tariffs and the gradual elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade; investment; competition and services; intellectual property; public procurement and e-commerce. They are essential components of further trade liberalisation and will benefit most of our negotiating partners. In addition, reform of the WTO is urgent and imperative. Secondly, in this process, European environmental and health policies, minimum social standards and development policy should retain their status. Thirdly, at the forthcoming negotiations on agriculture, emphasis should be placed on the multifunctional reasons for our European model of agriculture – the further development of rural areas, the provision of high-quality agricultural products and the environment – with reference being made also to Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. In the negotiations with China, which are now beginning, we should concentrate on our own interests, which are in part also contrary to those of the United States. Reducing the high Chinese peak tariffs, protecting intellectual property and facilitating investment are the most important points here. Increased market access for the least developed countries – and this is something which we need to consider together – should in any case be achieved very soon as part of the negotiations on the new ACP convention, although I do not know whether this will work on a unilateral basis. These countries should be granted waivers of between eight and ten years to allow them to adopt the comprehensive WTO body of legislation slowly and gradually, without neglecting their programme of sustainable development.

 Madam President, I have the impression that the vote should first be taken on the phrase “that free and fair world trade” etc. Is that correct? Have you included that?
Schwaiger (PPE-DE

 rapporteur – (DE) 
Madam President, I believe we are dealing with three adjectives. Free and fair world trade is the basis for the WTO Negotiations – that was my original text. A proposal for an amendment was then agreed in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, where “socially-balanced” was added. The opinions differ as to which adjectives should be added. I feel in any case that it should be "free and fair world trade”. Everyone agreed to that. The question of “is socially tolerable” or “socially acceptable” was disputed. We should therefore vote on the original text saying “free and fair world trade” and then vote separately on “socially-balanced”. Then we would have a result on the third point. I should in any case like to point out that "free and fair world trade” was the basis of all our work and an addition was appended here on which we should now vote.

 Madam President, I should like to repeat once again that there was a proposal for an amendment by the PPE. There was an oral explanation by Mr Chichester, that against the amendment he wished to keep the words “free and fair” in any case and that we should take a vote on that. The third question is “socially-balanced”, “yes” or “no”? We should vote on that. I have now understood what Mr Chichester said to me.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the EU approach to the WTO Millennium Round is in line with the work of the previous Committee on External Economic Relations which adopted its position on each of the negotiating rounds in Marrakech, Singapore and Geneva with a large majority. The constant dialogue with the previous Commissioner, Sir Léon Britain, in 1998 and at the beginning of 1999 also contributed to many of the ideas of the European Parliament being incorporated in the Commission’s communication of 14.7.1999 and to these ideas being fully taken up in terms of content. The main concern in all this was always free and fair world trade in the interest of the European economy and those employed in it. We are therefore keeping to the tradition of our earlier work. At this point I would like to thank the current Commissioner, Mr Lamy, for his outstanding cooperation with the European Parliament during the last two months. Since the new Commission began its work, we have been engaged in intensive and, I consider, thus far highly successful dialogue. Today is about clarifying the comprehensive global negotiating approach from the perspective of the European Union, weighing it up and placing it in the political context of an overall strategy. The entire Millennium Round should be accompanied by recommendations of a specific nature which, formulated in accordance with Rule 97 paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, give us the opportunity to influence the work of the Millennium Round before the new Agreement is concluded, to play our part and to bring our weight to bear accordingly. A first series of recommendations could be made at the beginning of the year 2000 and we could return in detail to many of the proposals made recently in the Committee on External Economic Relations. The Council and the Commission should vigorously defend the full negotiating approach of the European Union in Seattle. In our report, we also demand that the Commission be successful in this matter and return with the right results. Our negotiating approach must mirror our importance as the largest trading region in the world and, at the same time, meet our responsibility for worldwide economic balance of interests, above all vis-à-vis developing countries. What should our focal points be in all this? What is really important? Should the expansion of the world trade system and the opening up of markets be the main focus or should the defence of our European economic and social model, of the social and ecological market economy and of the Community policies developed in the interest of citizens and consumers take a prominent position? In my opinion we should do both, even if there is a certain tension between the two. Both objectives are of equal importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as was shown in Monday evening’s vote. We are now approaching a further opening up of the worldwide market. Tariffs must be further reduced and technical trade barriers should disappear. Our markets also should be further opened up to developing countries, in particular those which are least developed, and to the ACP countries. The understanding of citizens must be promoted and increased through greater transparency of the WTO rules and its crucially important dispute settlement system. On the other hand, the obligations of the European Union under other international agreements, for example the World Health Organisation or the international labour organisations, must also be made clear and be taken into account in the WTO negotiations. However, we are moving towards the inefficiency which results from overloading the WTO rules with objectives other than the principle objective of trade liberalisation and non-discrimination against contracting parties. So, for example, the basic working conditions and social clauses which were adopted in 1998 by the ILO must be kept current within the framework of a working forum drawn from the ILO and the WTO and must be brought into the discussion and taken into consideration without necessarily changing the WTO rules. If we assume that fair and free world trading has been the basis for the increase in prosperity of many countries and their people, and particularly developing countries, then we must also realise that, as the largest trading power in the world, the European Union has a basic interest in building on this success story and involving more and more peoples and countries globally. For this we need allies. We must link our interests with those of the pre-accession states in Europe, of our neighbours in Europe and of the developing countries, in particular the ACP countries. Furthermore, we need constant dialogue with the government, Congress and people of the United States, which will clarify our motives and build mutual understanding for a reasonable balance of interests with our partner. Through increased trade we will contribute to the extension of world peace, to prosperity and, if we organise ourselves properly, to greater social justice. The extent of our responsibility determines our strategy. It must be comprehensive, it must strive for balance in the benefits gained worldwide and it must be convincing for our partners. Market participants must have the easiest possible access to all markets in the world. The rules in force for this must be fair and must be based on the mutual granting of advantages and imposition of duties. The four basic freedoms of the internal market – the freedom to move, the free movement of goods, the freedom of services and the free movement of capital – must also be objectives which are valid worldwide. We are in favour of the conclusion of a Multilateral Environmental Agreement, which should then be taken into consideration within the framework of the WTO. In the area of services, which, above all for European suppliers, is the largest growth market, market access should be improved and new areas should be included, concerning which the European Parliament should certainly be clearly heard. We are in favour of the permanent integration and promotion of electronic commerce within the framework of GATT. The resolutions of the Uruguay Round on government procurement must be applied. Long term, a large number of the bilateral investment protection agreements within the framework of the World Trade Organisation must be replaced by comprehensive multilateral regulation. Competition within the liberated markets must become more effective and competition authorities must be set up accordingly. The European agricultural model of rural sustainable agriculture, which is based on the preservation of rural areas, the environment and our quality produce, as well as the production of foodstuffs, should be retained. Opposition should be met with reference to the rapidly increasing support practice of the US government. Finally, a further word on development cooperation: it must be updated and expanded within the framework of the ACP Partnership. The world trade system is based, in key areas, on the contribution of Europeans and Americans. In the 60s, at the same time as introducing the common external tariff, we also adopted, in the various Kennedy Rounds and others, a consistent policy worldwide of reducing tariffs and opening up markets. The result was the opening up of new markets in third countries, but also the opening up of our markets for other industrial states. By way of conclusion, may I thank the Secretariat, our advisers and all those in Parliament who have worked together on this report. We had very little time and our technical and other departments worked magnificently. (Applause)

 Mr Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of world trade in the last 50 years is a success story. In the last 50 years, trade throughout the world has increased by a factor of 17, and has expanded by more than twice the level of macroeconomic production. Increased prosperity and the creation of jobs in Europe are an important consequence of this. Freer and fairer world trade within the framework of a strengthened multilateral world trade system formed a successful foundation for this. Progress to an exceptional extent and at an exceptional rate in the globalisation of real activity now makes further development of this multilateral body of regulations, which was based on GATT and is now the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, imperative. The focus of the Millennium Round is this objective. A comprehensive European Union Strategy, which embraces all the areas concerned in a dynamic way is being proposed by the Commission and, I feel I can already say this as a rapporteur, is widely supported within the European Parliament. We are defending the European Agricultural Model, food production, the maintenance of farms as family businesses, preservation of the countryside and environmental protection in equal measure. This Millennium Round should not be characterised by a defensive attitude towards the American position on imports of agricultural and genetically modified products into the European Union. Instead, the European Union should be finding confederates for its dynamic global strategy. The usefulness of globalisation should be measured against its usefulness to the regions and nations of the world equally, so that a better balance is achieved between the interests of the European Union, of the other European States, of the USA, of other industrial countries, and newly industrialised and developing countries. The framework now available to us, established with the World Trade Organisation in 1995, must be developed further in this direction and its instruments must be perfected. The essential bases for negotiations and solutions mentioned in the Commission document of July 1999 have so far met with a predominantly positive response in our discussions within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Today, I would like to touch briefly on our guidelines for content. In November, we have the opportunity to discuss this again in detail. Our draft resolution will predominantly include the dynamic elements which the President of the Council and also Commissioner Lamy have already mentioned and which will include our ideas on the improved incorporation of financial services, on investment and competition policy within the framework of the WTO, on the further reduction of duties on industrial products and on the improved integration, indeed the “mainstreaming”, of environmental and consumer protection in the body of regulations of the World Trade Organisation and vice versa. The protection of copyright must be improved in many developing countries. Labour standards should be taken into account more in the world trade system, and our markets must be opened more to developing countries. There are still, however, some outstanding questions regarding the cooperation between the Council and the Commission, on the one hand, and with the European Parliament, on the other hand, within the scope of the Millennium Round. Let me stress one thing at the outset. The European Parliament gratefully accepts this dialogue with the Commission and hopes that this dialogue will also include the Council. It will represent its position within the framework of its resolution, which will certainly be adopted in November, in an energetically coherent but also responsible manner. You can assume, Mr Sasi, as President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Lamy, as Commissioner, that in the position determined in our November resolution we will present ourselves as energetic and coherent both to you and to our partners in the Millennium Round. We shall strive thereby to be true to our responsibility as the elected representatives of the peoples of Europe. Secondly, we are assuming, a previously justified assumption, that the Commission and the Council are representing the interests of the European Union with equal coherence. The strength of the European Union as the largest trading power in the world resides in its joint position, which is represented by all elements. We are therefore somewhat concerned to hear rumours that in the Council, even before the start of negotiations, some delegations are now ... (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional co-operation between the states of West Africa has made good progress in recent times. A West African economic community on the model of the European Union is beginning to take shape. But one of the main impediments to further regional integration is the non-operation of democratic institutions, particularly of the Parliament in Togo. The Group of the European People’s Party therefore welcomes the serious endeavours of practically all political forces in Togo to make the development towards democracy irrevocable and to prepare within the next few months for elections to the National Assembly which will be indisputably democratic and free of pressure from the army and the State President and his entourage. We are in favour of peaceful transition to a fully functioning democracy. We also accept that State President Eyadema will continue his period of office until the year 2003, even though the counting procedures of the last presidential election showed rather more than cosmetic flaws. We also call, however, upon the State President and his administration, to agree, in collaboration with all political forces in the country, upon an election procedure which gives the same chances to every political grouping which complies with democratic rules. We acknowledge the very constructive role played in this by our former colleague, the French ombudsman, Bernard Stasi, and his two colleagues from Germany and Austria, as mediators. In this regard, it is essential that the elections are faultlessly prepared, carried out in a non-partisan way and result in a government freely and democratically elected by the people of Togo.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the amendments voted on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development – something like eight hundred of them – have made plain how controversial the Commission’s proposals on the future of the common agricultural policy for Europe are. The spectrum extends from outright rejection to qualified approval. Despite that, we have managed to draw up a compromise that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was able to adopt; this entailed a feat of strength the like of which has never before been seen, although it must be conceded that this was done under great pressure of time. This compromise represents, as a German weekly periodical puts it, a respectable staging-post on the road to an agricultural policy that will take us up to 2013. The imminent WTO negotiations, the soon-to-be-accomplished enlargement of the EU, and a mandate to review Agenda 2000 – these were the constraints upon the Commission when, in January 2003 and at the Council’s behest, it presented Parliament with its proposals for its consideration. If it is the case that, in the reports now being put to the vote in this House, much has been toned down, much added, and a certain amount rejected as currently impracticable, then that has, in the final analysis, happened under pressure from those who work in agriculture, whom it is our function to represent. Many critics worked on the assumption that, just as opposing views on the proposals were to be found in the Council, it would not be possible, at the present time, for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to come up with a workable solution. It may be that the Council had been covertly hoping that Parliament – because it was unable to do so or, above all, because of pressure of time – would not come to any decision, so that it would be this House, rather than the Council, that would be able to put the brakes on an agricultural reform that is much needed. I can tell the Ministers of Agriculture that they are way off the mark. Whatever the result of Thursday’s vote may be, it will not be binding, as agriculture is still not yet subject to codecision, a situation which, it is to be hoped, will soon change. The result of this vote will, however, send a signal and impose on you, the Council, who are supposed to take final decisions, the duty of finding your own compromises before this Presidency’s time is up. We in Parliament have done our homework, and, speaking on behalf of my group, I can only recommend to the Council that it act in accordance with this House’s balanced proposals. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, in view of all the decisions being made during this key phase of the enlargement process, I would like to support you in your call for us to continue with the reform of the common agricultural policy. However, and this is an important distinction, we are now talking about reforming the common agricultural policy as from 2007, which means that we will continue with the present policy up to 2006 and that Europe's agricultural sector will move forward on the basis of a reformed policy as from 2007. Commissioner Fischler, I think you need to assume that neither the timing nor the content of your proposals will be viable if we have correctly interpreted the compromise on direct agricultural payments negotiated in Brussels by the Heads of State and Government. In other words, it is now clear that the agreements reached at the Berlin Summit will remain in force until 2006, and that the most recent decisions provide a firm basis for planning by the EU's farmers up to 2013. This means that the candidate countries can certainly rely on increases in direct payments as from 2004. That, incidentally, formed part of the proposals presented by the Commission back in December 2001 on the financing of direct agricultural payments for the enlargement countries. The only difference, and this was already clear to us back then, is that the 100% compensation payments for all EU Member States in 2013 will no longer be matched by 100% financing capacity as in 2006. I think it must be clear to everyone that this will be lower by then. Every farmer in the enlarged European Union must be aware of that. In order to prevent mistakes, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are, in a motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups in the European Parliament, requesting, for this reason among others, that unlimited budget rights and full codecision should be transferred to this House for agricultural matters.

Mr President, on the evening of 12 August, my daughter bought a camera in my home town of Döbelin, population 28 000. Three hours later, the shop no longer existed. The same applies to 1 425 homes in the district and 711 businesses. And of course, schools, scientific establishments and, above all, public infrastructures were seriously affected and, to put it bluntly, agriculture is staring ruin in the face. As we have already heard, 220 000 hectares were flooded and the provisional estimates of flood damage to farming are enormous. Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures. Worst of all is the loss of animal fodder, mainly as the result of the grain lost. Governments and the European Union have already given a considerable sum of money in initial emergency aid. And quite apart from that, the Commissioner responsible, Franz Fischler, with whom I am in constant personal contact, and again may I express thanks to him for that, has ordered EUR 560 million to be paid in the form of direct payments to farmers, although the final figure will be higher because, according to my information, regions in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have now been included. As you have already heard, set-aside areas have been provided, together with cheap grain for animal fodder. My request, or rather my question is this: have these EUR 560 million really been available since 1 September? To hear that from you in person, my dear Mr Fischler, would be music to the ears of the victims. Because make no mistake. This is a national emergency and, although the regions affected must make every effort to deal with it, they will be stretched beyond their financial limits. Dealing with this disaster in the short-, medium- and long-term is therefore the job of these regions, the national governments and the European Union. And action must be taken quickly because the people affected are in urgent need of financial support. (Applause)

 Mr President, I cannot go along with the Liberals on this. I would inform you, (Interruptions)
 my dear Mr Schulz, that is simply because the Liberals indicated yesterday that they intended to reject it, and so I assumed that the honourable Member was among their number, but that is obviously an oversight. But that which is not, may yet be! Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to inform you that this second Ayuso González report refers to the Council's compromise proposal, which does not provide for a common organisation of the market, 
but only for a market regulation. This will result in Article 10 being dropped, as Article 10 states that national subsidies are prohibited in an organised market. That has lapsed, and so I ask you to agree to this urgent procedure.

Mr President, painstaking efforts are needed to find any reference at all to the political domain of agriculture and rural development in this 28-page Commission strategy paper for 2003. The word ‘agriculture’ is mentioned all of three times in the course of one three-page section. This is perhaps due in part to the fact that the codecision procedure does not yet apply to agricultural legislation. At the same time, we are called upon for the first time to participate in the strategic assessment of issues such as enlargement, the WTO talks, the development of the Budget and the mid-term evaluation. On enlargement, the plan is to conclude the accession negotiations with the applicant countries in 2003, and then enlargement could begin in 2004. We are all well aware of the monumental tasks that await the Commission, Parliament and the Council in the areas of agriculture and rural development in 2003. In this respect, enlargement will also be a top priority of agriculture policy in 2003 and will require great negotiating skills. Yesterday’s hearing on this subject in the Committee on Budgets highlighted the amount of work that is still to be done. Close dialogue with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is essential, as is better use of the resources allocated to pre-accession aid. In the WTO context, agriculture also plays a key role. And so I say to our friends in the Commission that we expect you to provide us with continuous information and consultation on progress in the WTO trade talks. You yourselves refer on page 14 of your crazy paper to a decisive phase in these negotiations. On the Budget, following the result of the vote on the Färm report, or, to be more specific, the adoption by this chamber of Guideline No 9, care should be taken to ensure that the amended mid-term evaluation is taken into account as far as possible in the 2003 Budget. This quite simple precept will cause huge headaches, particularly in view of the fact that the Member States are becoming increasingly accustomed to receiving substantial ring-fenced rebates of unused resources from the agricultural budget; these bonuses are particularly welcome, since they can save some countries from the prospect of an admonitory letter from Brussels. The strategic imperative for 2003 must therefore be full and more efficient utilisation of the agricultural budget, including flexible use of resources for new rural development programmes. One very important requirement is that quality must play a more important role in the allocation of aid under the common agricultural policy. Even non-farmers can see the point of compensatory payments that are based on quality.

Mr President, Commissioner, limiting the number of bulls for which premiums are payable to ninety per farm, one of the points in the Commission’s seven-point plan, is unlikely to prove effective in matching beef production to demand in the European Union. It is universally accepted that, in view of the fall in beef consumption, cattle farming cannot be sustained at the accustomed level. But let me say, Commissioner, that the burden of this reduction must not be distributed unfairly to the detriment of particular regions. If we want to speak about a new regime of premium entitlements, we cannot base such a regime on an absolute ceiling, as the Commission proposes, but on a solution that is reasonable for all farms, a point that Mr Sturdy has already made. Such a solution can only be based on the amount of available grassland or, perhaps better still, on the input of working hours, in other words on the number of farmhands employed in accordance with the laws and regulations – and let me stress that last proviso. Incidentally, if you remember, we have held this discussion already. We held it when we were discussing the organisation of the market in beef and veal in the context of the debate on Agenda 2000. But when you write, Commissioner Fischler, in your reply to a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that there is only one derogation from the 90-head rule in the new Länder 
of the Federal Republic of Germany and that the reduction there ought now to result in structural change, you are missing the point that the number of persons employed in agriculture in those regions has fallen in the last ten years from 800 000 to 150 000. May I say to the Commission that this is quite enough structural change! Or, if I may resort to sarcasm, do you perhaps want to solve the beef problem at the expense of these new Länder 
in eastern Germany, thereby ensuring that the farms there will be forced to shut down? Why, in fact, can we not contemplate a tighter squeeze on premium payments on the basis of stocking density per hectare of forage area? You have provided for a reduction from 2 to 1.8 livestock units. But I should like to see a different system, one which would render the 90-head premium limit superfluous. Just imagine it were left to the farmer’s discretion to decide how drastically he cut down the number of his cattle below the density threshold at which premiums became payable. For this, however, the farmer would have to receive an additional compensatory payment corresponding to the extent of the voluntary reduction. This could be called beef set-aside, by analogy with fruit and vegetable production, because we spend considerable amounts on set-aside premiums for non-production in those domains too. If this system were to result in a lower level of beef production, it would be right and proper for us to reward those farmers who trim the size of their herds in such a natural way instead of producing surpluses which cannot be marketed and may even have to be destroyed. Perhaps, Commissioner, you could take to this idea. Your conversion need not be immediate!

 Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to stress that I am grateful to see Point 7, the special purchasing programme. It makes the position clear. This means that tests are carried out before storage, and above all each Member State can make its own decision. I am very grateful for that. That creates a very acceptable basis for debate. I have a question concerning the stocking density. The ratio of forage area to cereal is 2.0 to 1.8 – so do I automatically increase the base area to give farmers an opportunity to further improve their living by growing cereals? Now for my second question. And I would like to welcome Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf with his bow tie, maybe that is a reference to the fact that he now has clover grass, but we could also use Lucerne grass, that is just as good. Can you tell me why we do not use pulses, which we urgently need as a substitute for animal meal in these areas, and why does everything necessarily have to be organic?

I move that the Council representative also be present at the debate.

 Commissioner, I believe that as long as we do not have consistent labelling, we will never be free of disputes about BSE in this House and in Europe in general. The fact that you are now telling us that compulsory labelling going back to animals’ place of birth will not be implemented until 2003 – Mr Böge has already touched on this – well, in my opinion that is partly to blame for this whole cankerous BSE crisis. Now that the legal basis has changed – and that is the reason why we have this new regulation now – so that this is no longer to be dealt with under Article 37, that is by means of consultation, but under Article 152, under the co-decision procedure – we in this House damned well have a duty to bring this deadline forward from 2003! Yes, that is our duty, and my question to you is this: you said that you would put pressure on these countries concerning this issue, which is to be the subject of a decision in the next few days. I would like to know what scope the Commission has for exerting pressure so that these Member States bring in consistent labelling and identification of bovine animals before 2003? If that could be done as quickly as possible, we in this House would not have to worry about BSE any more!

 Mr President, I want to concentrate briefly on three matters. Firstly, Mr Prodi, I would remark that Mr Fischler was very well prepared on the matter of agriculture and provided convincing proof of his specialist knowledge. In the hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, probably one of the most important questions was that of Parliament’s participation in decision-making in the matter of Community agricultural policy. In this connection, my group expressly welcomes Mr Fischler’s statement that basic legislation affecting the way in which the general direction of agricultural policy is conceived should be decided as part of a joint decision-making process and that he would actively put forward this view at the future Intergovernmental Conference. Mr Prodi, I am assuming that you support Mr Fischler on these matters. Secondly, a lot of time at the hearing was devoted not only to the outstanding questions concerning enlargement of the Union but also to the question of introducing the European agricultural model to the international stage in the future WTO negotiations and, above all, safeguarding it. Here too I can state, on behalf of my group, that it is clearly the settled will of the Commission to include such questions as, for example, socio-agricultural standards and European environmental provisions in the Millennium Round. Our colleague, Mr Garot, has already referred to this matter. Thirdly: if, in the next legislature, the Commissioner-designate for Agriculture succeeds in listening more to the draft amendments introduced by Parliament and to parliamentarians themselves (as long as, it is only fair to say, the latter do not exceed the budgetary limits and do not put existing legislation out of force), then a majority of my group is of the opinion that the Candidate’s experience, skills and commitment suggest that he will do some good work as a Member of the Commission.

 Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the proposal for a regulation on access to gas transmission networks. It is important to have reliable rules for access to networks. We found that with the gas directive last year. My group believes the proposal should be further discussed together with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Commissioner, there are four points I would like to recommend you consider in greater detail in the Council debate. Firstly, investment incentives. We can talk about markets here for a long time. If we have no investors, then in the end we have no market either. The Commission has often referred to the great risks carried by investors in the gas sector – exploration, pipeline construction. There is competition in pipelines; there already was when the monopolies existed. That is how the market came into being and it must remain clear that tariffs based on costs alone may deter investments. My second remark is please will you consider whether more weight can be given to cross-border gas transport. Thirdly, comitology. The problem is not comitology itself, but the question is whether Article 9 is in a correct relationship to Articles 3 to 8, that is whether the most important points really are in Articles 3 to 8. This can perhaps be improved when it is discussed in the Council. My fourth comment, Commissioner de Palacio, is that of course everyone who has anything to say about the market is important, regulators, network operators and above all investors, and it is absolutely clear that you talk to them before you make proposals to Parliament and Council; you always have done. Now they would all like to be mentioned in the legislation. Personally, I do not see why they should be, because I believe the Commission knows how to do its job, but if it would give those I have just named pleasure to be mentioned in a recital, then I do not really mind. Then I would like to say something about the other report on security of natural gas supply. It is correct that we depend very much on imports. It is therefore right that we should be concerned with this and oblige the Member States to introduce a suitable policy. Now Parliament has adopted at first reading a different text than the one the Commission presented and the Council has backed Parliament in the matter. We are therefore now speaking about a different text than the Commission originally presented and in our view this text no longer contains any rules for the internal market. This means that the European Union has only one way of justifying it at all, namely Article 100 of the Treaty, and, on the basis of the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the committee therefore recommends that Parliament follow the Council’s lead on this.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome your second declaration – that the Commission is asking the ECJ to clarify the procedural aspects of budget monitoring – very warmly. The euro – let us admit it for once – has achieved far greater stability in the five years that we can look back on than the Deutschmark did. On the other hand, the euro is a difficult currency, for it runs alongside not one but fifteen national finance and economic policies, has an ‘open-door’ policy, and is still a young currency. It is therefore especially important to enforce Article 104 of the Treaty and the associated Stability Pact rigorously, and the eight countries and their citizens who have done their homework have a right to expect this. That is why the Commission is acting properly by clarifying these rights and enforcing budget discipline. That in itself serves to boost confidence in this new currency. We still have a lot of work ahead of us. Thank you for this decision.

 Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, many thanks. Security of supply in the natural gas sector can certainly be an issue for the European Union, which, taken as a whole, is dependent on imports for some 75% of its natural gas, although – unlike with oil – there is no suppliers’ cartel. I might add that the supplier countries are themselves dependent on exports to the EU, as natural gas is of any value only if it is transported and sold. On the other hand, the countries supplying us are Russia, Algeria, Libya, and the countries around the Caspian Sea, the stability of which is a matter of concern to the EU. It is regrettable that the Commission does not discuss all this in its proposal. What is behind the proposal instead is, in essence, interruptions in supplies to the EU market. I regret having to say, Madam Vice-President, on behalf of the lead Committee, that the proposal, as it stands, has found no supporters in this House, and that some of us reject it outright. That is not the position taken by the main Committee, which proposes that the plenary should send a message to the Commission, the Council, the participants in the market and also to the supplying and producing countries by dealing with the issue in a new and different way, turning the proposal upside down and – let me say this with particular clarity – refraining from creating a category of dirigiste
 European actions. This, then, is about three things: one is not seeing management so much as being primarily about holding and administering reserve stocks, that is, deterring investors from doing what they are actually meant to do and emphasising the responsibility of state agencies, but rather doing the precise opposite by encouraging businesses to invest, by emphasising the role they play and taking into account the fact that they already do a great deal towards securing supply; the ways in which they do this are various, including the diversification of sources of supply, international pipelines and storage tanks, long-term supply contracts and the like. Above all, the Commission proposal fails to engage at a fundamental level with the fact that supply as a whole does indeed have a price. Parliament cannot approve the handing over to the European level – represented by the Commission – of instruments that suspend the market price, prevent markets from signalling prices and shortages and make no reference to the prices obtaining in the system of supply as a whole. The second essential approach should involve addressing the responsibilities of the Member States, which have done, and are able to do, a great deal in this area. I must at this juncture, Madam Vice-President, make the straightforward point that as recently as 1998 – which is only a couple of years ago – the Commission shared the general consensus that what the Member States do in this area was quite sufficient. That was, indeed, stated quite officially by the Energy Council. In this, the different actual conditions in the Member States also have to be taken into account. My third point is that, at EU level, it could then be our task to create a framework for obligations on enterprises, with which we could equip the Member States, so that these in turn could impose this as an obligation on their own enterprises. At European Union level, provision could also be made to empower the Member States in crisis situations, conditional upon business not being able to respond itself, or else not in good time. Only in extreme cases and grave crisis situations could European law oblige the Member States to take specific measures – I emphasise that it would be European law that would oblige them to act. I hope I have not misunderstood what you have just said, but we emphatically repudiate your suggestion that the European level should intervene directly in the government of the Member States, of which there will soon be twenty-five; it cannot do that. That Parliament must not under any circumstances approve such a thing was the unanimous opinion of all the committees that have considered this.

 Mr President, with the next three reports this House is voting on the package negotiated with the Council on the decision to create an internal energy market in Europe. As acting chairman of the committee responsible, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I am obliged to make a statement here before we continue. The House is voting on 50 amendments in three reports. This compromise document is accompanied by two statements. One is the statement by the Commission, which the Vice-President of the Commission presented to the House during Monday's debate, and that is recorded in the Minutes. It is also accompanied by an interinstitutional statement by Parliament, Council and Commission, and it has been agreed that this statement should be read into the Minutes of Parliament, that both statements should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union with the legislative text and that this arrangement should also be recorded in Parliament's Minutes now. I am therefore obliged to read out the interinstitutional statement here. I can reassure you that it is not very long. It reads as follows: ‘The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission underline the need for Member States to ensure that adequate financial resources for decommissioning and waste management activities, which are audited in Member States, are actually available for the purpose for which they have been established and are managed in a transparent way, thus avoiding obstacles to fair competition in the energy market’. Mr President, I ask you to sign this statement on behalf of this House and to arrange for its publication in the Official Journal. (Applause)

 Mr President, I have to start by making a statement in addition to my speaking time as acting chairman of the responsible committee. The voting lists for Wednesday that have been circulating here so far are wrong, or at least misleading. Let me say, referring to my own report, that Amendments Nos 1 to 5, are not the compromises they are described as in the lists. The Committee officially withdrew them. Amendments Nos 7 to 10 are compromise amendments, but Amendment No 6 is not, contrary to what is stated on the prepared voting list. Amendment No 6 is not part of the compromise; indeed, as I see it, it is out of order. I ask the Bureau to check whether it is out of order, so that Wednesday’s vote can proceed in a correct manner. Mr President, please do not include this in my speaking time. (Applause)

 Mr President, I would like to start by reiterating, with reference to the legislation on cross-border exchanges in electricity, that this law uses a number of measures to benefit a truly EU-wide internal market. There are to be funds to compensate transit networks for their services. In the Member States, charges on producers in respect of cross-border exchanges in electricity will be harmonised in order to avoid different competition conditions prevailing in different states. Bottlenecks in the networks will be apportioned in accordance with the laws of the market rather than on a territorial basis, and tariffs will no longer be determined by the distance between the contracting parties, but solely on the basis of the physical flow. It is also a good thing that this law opens the way for new electricity plant to be properly sited, specifically in the vicinity of centres of consumption, and not, for example, where the primary energy used is especially cheap, thereby giving rise to massive new transport networks. Taken together, all three laws that we are adopting are milestones for the EU’s internal market. After fifteen years of discussion, they are putting into practice the freedoms in the area of energy that the Union’s citizens were guaranteed in the Treaties – freedom of establishment, free movement of goods and freedom to provide services. These directives make these quite explicit. Moreover, they mean that the competition will put pressure on European firms to perform well, and it is to be hoped that these will soon, to an ever-increasing extent, discover their roles and capabilities in the global market. Let me make it abundantly clear, however, that those who make laws can do no more than grant citizens freedoms; it is the adult citizen alone who can make use of them. It is like an election. Voting in one is a right, but it is for the citizens to decide whether or not to exercise it; the reciprocity of supply and demand in the areas of electricity and gas is likewise something that the public have to understand and of which they have to avail themselves. This legislation hinges upon the question of how the remaining technical monopolies – the networks – are to be brought to market in such a way as to make competition possible. These laws contain important provisions for this purpose, in that, firstly, they put the networks themselves under the aegis of their own companies; secondly, they create regulatory systems in the Member States to guarantee neutral management of the networks; and thirdly – something that has been particularly important to Parliament – they govern the way in which these regulatory authorities in the Member States cooperate with one another and with the Commission, so that we do not end up with fifteen – and soon as many as twenty-five – different approaches in the Member States’ regulatory authorities. There is one thing I want to make perfectly clear, and in doing so I am following on from what Mr Turmes said. If, after a number of years, Parliament or – Madam Vice-President – the Commission should find that this legislation has still not brought about a truly Europe-wide internal market in electricity and gas, then let nobody be surprised if the concept of a European regulator is mooted and then actually brought to fruition – which we are not doing right now – along with the unbundling of property rights over the networks, which we are not doing now either. Both these options are still under consideration. It is now for the participants in the market to avoid the situation in which the legislature would have to take such action. In view of that, my hope is not only that the legislation will be adopted, but also that the participants in the market, the consumers and service-providers, will bring it to life in a tremendous way. Finally, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and draftsmen, who have worked together in a quite remarkable way on these issues for years on end. Likewise, Madam Vice-President, I thank the Commission, you yourself and all its members. Many thanks to all my fellow workers, whom I congratulate on doing a difficult and first-rate job.

 The reunification of Europe is an opportunity of historic significance, but whether the Czech Republic is founded upon the European order is a matter of doubt. Czech Prime Ministers have described the post-World War expulsions as 'just' and 'necessary', and have even held them up as examples in present-day conflicts. This must be set against the statement in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights to the effect that 'collective expulsions are prohibited.' It was for that reason that Parliament's resolution adopted on 20 November 2002 stated, under heading O, that ‘ethnically-fixated policies leading to collective expulsions and the destruction of cultural goods are a flagrant breach of fundamental human rights and the common European legal culture’. This is an unambiguous verdict. It is not aimed at exacting restitution of any kind, but makes it clear that Czech positions such as those referred to are an offence against the most fundamental principles of law, which the EU exists to maintain. Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus' statement that the ‘events full of violence and human tragedies’, which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans, were ‘unacceptable acts from today's point of view’, nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government, or by its parliament, or by groups or parties in it. They have therefore failed to dispel the doubts as to whether the Czech Republic has its roots in the ground of European legal culture. This means that not all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU have been complied with, so that we are unable to vote in favour of it doing so.

 Mr President, there will surely be great public interest in the topics of today's debate, which give us the chance to put an end to a certain schizophrenia by which, in the negotiations to date, we have been demanding more of the candidate countries than we do of our own Member States. I would therefore like to congratulate the Commission on doing as the Vice-President has suggested, and adduce another weighty argument in favour of Community-wide standards. The sooner we have Community-wide standards, the sooner we will have the chance to let them have an external effect, in, for example, Russia and the Ukraine, which is most important and in our interest. That would, in addition, be the best way to support the IEAE. Madam Vice-President, I would like to ask you a question related to that. Could you briefly describe where the Commission's proposals on the line taken so far in negotiations with the candidate countries are leading?

 Mr President, I would say only this to the lady from the Left of this House: the European Union is completely neutral as regards privatisation, but what is a matter of historical record is that employees' rights were never more trampled on than in the states in which everything was nationalised.

Mr President, the Minutes wrongly state that, following the report on, and description of, the attack on Mrs Klaß, I had simply called on the President to take disciplinary steps. Although true, that is only half the truth. In addition, I publicly called on him to lay charges before the responsible law enforcement agencies against the employees of this House who made themselves liable to criminal proceedings for failing to give assistance when Mrs Klaß was attacked. I request that the Minutes be amended accordingly.
Mombaur (PPE-DE

Mr President, the Commission has made a proposal, and Parliament has no amendments to put forward. Those Member States that want to apply coal subsidies have to decide on this themselves and take responsibility for it, even bearing in mind that the subsidies are very high, and that the money involved could perhaps have been used to promote other, forward-looking, industries. The European Union is being asked only because it has to rule on the compatibility of these subsidies with the European market. A qualified majority in the Council is required for that, Madam Vice-President – and it is you personally that I am addressing, if you would be graciously pleased to listen to me. It must not appear as if an essentially superfluous unanimity in the Council is being concocted, as is currently being attempted through an unparalleled deception after the example of the fraudulent Conference of Nice. It is not on for manifestly illegal subsidies by other Member States to be sanctioned by means of a unanimous resolution, with, for example, French, Italian and Dutch subsidies to freight carriers being declared not to be detrimental to the common market. That adds up, per annum and per lorry, to a subsidy of EUR 7 000 to the benefit of freight carriers in some countries and to the detriment of those in all the others. That such a thing can be unanimously sanctioned in the Council, thus contravening the European Treaties, is a scandal! Madam Vice-President, a policy of that sort flagrantly violates the Treaties, and does so with consequences that are incalculable. I note that the conditions specified in the Treaties for such permission to be granted, even unanimously, are not fulfilled, and I call upon the Commission to contest these fraudulent outcomes of Council meetings in the European Court of Justice and, if possible, to put a stop to them.

Mr President, there is just one thing to add to the important points raised by Mrs Klaß. The whole incident was filmed. So the time has come for you, Mr President, to take disciplinary measures against everyone who was in the vicinity on behalf of the security service and failed to intervene. You should also file charges with the relevant criminal authorities on the grounds of failure to provide assistance! (Applause)

rapporteur

 Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to address cross-border trade in electricity. As the committee's rapporteur, may I say that the committee supports the Commission's proposal for a regulation. Cross-border trading must finally get underway so that producers can supply other Member States, enabling competition to be introduced between existing suppliers across the EU. There are five preconditions for this. Firstly, the networks which operate the transit flows need to have their costs reimbursed from a fund. Secondly, it will only work if the same conditions apply throughout Europe, that is if there is regulation. Thirdly, both producers and consumers have to pay into the fund. Fourthly, these producer payments need to be standardised in the Member States to avoid any party being at a competitive advantage. Fifthly, there must be no internal duties, so no payments by so-called importers and exporters – which are in any case an odd concept in an internal market – and there must be no distance-related tariffs. What counts here is physics and not the law. I should like to make three concluding comments on this issue. The place where the electricity is generated is significant. This depends on many factors. The committee will no doubt be flexible, even if additional so-called price signals, which meet the criteria that I have mentioned, are developed and applied. In Florence, the regulators, the networks and the Commission are of course reflecting on this. The committee is not proposing to change the competences in the comitology procedure or in the fora. Since this is codecision, however, we propose that the situation be reviewed after four years to ascertain whether the procedure advocated here meets the requirements of codecision. After all, the regulators in the Member States and the experts, for example the network operators, should be involved in a regulatory process. The regulation should not come into force before the directives which also legislate on changes in the electricity and gas markets. This brings me to my second subject. Here I should like to make a few comments not in my capacity as rapporteur but as a member of the committee, and specifically, Madam Vice-President, for you to take with you to Barcelona. Firstly, the Member of the Council which still only wants partial market opening – and we know exactly which one this is – is in contravention of the Treaties. I should like to make this absolutely clear here and it is also in the committee's motion for a resolution. These Treaties guarantee all EU citizens the freedom of establishment, the freedom to provide services and the freedom of movement of goods across the EU. These freedoms will only be implemented once all electricity and gas consumers are able to select their suppliers from across the EU. Only then will we have achieved conformity with the Treaties. Secondly, if a Member State wishes to treat all the households in its country equally – for example all those between Lille and the Pyrenees – it may do so; it is free to make that decision. However, it can invite tenders for the work and ask which competitor is the most suitable and best qualified for the job. A supply monopoly cannot be justified. This too violates current law. It lends credence to the suspicion that people are lining their pockets illegally. Perhaps I might make the following additional points on the reports. We support free choice for all consumers across the EU. We are in favour of all suppliers having access to the technical networks, which need to be managed in separate companies to prevent discrimination against certain types of supplier and to prevent abuse of dominant position within a company. We are in favour of having regulatory systems in the Member States to ensure that this is the case. So far – and here I fully agree with my fellow MEP, Mr Rapkay – this has not been satisfactorily resolved in any Member State. Like the Council I support a solution which takes account of the heterogeneity of the national network structures.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a treaty expires, but the foundations remain, for the foundation, the ECSC Treaty, has long been part of the structure of the European Union. We still, too, have the day of commemoration of 9 May 1950, that day when Robert Schumann presented the brilliant plan of Jean Monnet from the South of France and thereby laid the foundations of what we today call the European work for peace. The ECSC Treaty has two successors: the subject of our speeches today and, as regards future coal mining, the aid issues with which we will deal later on. I would like to make four brief remarks about the two reports before us. First, the procedure proposed here is distinguished by pre-democratic conceptions. This was tolerable in 1952, but it is of course no longer acceptable to let the Council alone decide when, in the meantime, the Union's citizens have elected us to be their fifth democratic Parliament. We must be clear about that. Second, it is right to use the annual revenue of EUR 45 million to support coal and steel research. One could say in legal terms that it is an anticipated form of reinforced co-operation among a few. It is of course just as right to consider how the committee recommends, on the basis of Mr Linkohr's presentation, to progressively make the fund into a foundation, because then the problem of new members will be easier to solve than if they had to have a share in the old members' contributions. Third, the Commission has done the right thing in subordinating the Research Fund to fundamental rights, for the Charter of Fundamental Rights recapitulates the laws in force. That means that everything that is to be organised at a European level must be measured against the yardstick of fundamental rights and is bound by them. I find it objectionable that the Council, in its deliberations, struck out these three proposals by the Commission and wants to remove the text's reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. That constitutes an incredible legal scandal, which we must denounce, and for that reason I call it by its name. So I come to my fourth point, and am particularly curious to know how you, Commissioner, will respond to it. Your Commission originally rested on a different legal foundation. You now refer to the protocol to the Treaty of Nice, and that is pretty breathtaking, as the Treaty of Nice is not expected to enter into force before 23 July 2002. On that day, however, the ECSC Treaty ceases to have effect, and we can hardly allow a lawless state of affairs. So I would very much like a reply from you as to how you intend to proceed and as to what you intend to propose, so that there will be no state of lawlessness from midnight on 23 July 2002, for then the gripping question would arise of to whom this money, which would then no longer have an owner in law, actually belonged.
Mombaur (PPE-DE

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we think back today in Parliament to the accident in Chernobyl, what we remember is the cynical attitude taken by a dictatorship towards man’s safety and his environment. I stress this point because we have, of course, acted in the debate on many occasions as if Chernobyl were everywhere. It is not. Twelve years ago a dictatorship crumbled, a dictatorship which from the outset did not have the standard of technical safety which we have in the rest of the world or, more to the point, in Europe. For the rest, we should clarify that, in a democracy, discussion takes place in public. That alone contributes to safety. A democracy has independent supervisory agencies. That too contributes to safety. And it has independent courts, which again contribute to safety. In other words, a democratic system operating under the rule of law is, per se, such an important safety factor that any parallels need to be made clear at this point. The consequences of the cynical attitude of a dictatorship, which had a nuclear power station which was unsafe from the outset and four reactors which were shut down in December in response to international pressure, have had to be borne mainly by the people in the countries affected. I note that, even twelve years after the fall of the Soviet Union, many leading politicians have yet to depart from this cynical attitude towards the people, as the truly abysmal treatment of the people after the sinking of the Kursk 
proved. Public discussion is still not a routine matter there and we would do well to bear that in mind. We are right to say in our resolution that there is widespread concern. But I also notice that many people are wrongly feeding this concern in order to achieve a completely different objective, namely to lump unsafe nuclear power stations together with the safe nuclear power stations which are currently being built around the world, including soon in the Union and America, and this is unacceptable. This does not apply in other technical areas: if something goes wrong with a car, we do not ban all cars, and if an aeroplane crashes, it is terrible, but we do not ban all aeroplanes. We want help for the Ukraine. But we must also tell the Ukraine and ourselves that we cannot rest easily just by giving money; we must put conditions in place there so that money in a functioning economic system can fulfil the same purpose as it does in a democracy, which is why we expect – as the resolution makes clear – all manner of changes and adjustments to the energy system in the Ukraine. Commissioner Wallström, if we are talking about learning lessons, then that applies in particular to the candidate countries. We have nine new nuclear power stations there with 27 reactors. Of which we know that three power stations with eight reactors are to be shut down. But we know equally well that other parts of nuclear power stations can be upgraded and that brings me to my sixty-four thousand dollar question to you, Commissioner: the Commission is conducting accession negotiations, including on the “standard energy safety” chapter on behalf of the European Union. Parliament is still waiting for you to tell us and the public exactly which nuclear power station safety standard the negotiations are based on. To my knowledge you have promised Parliament as much on several occasions, but the matter is still pending. The Commission has a debt to discharge here. I only hope that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy will receive a clear answer from you as soon as possible as to what safety standard negotiations with candidate countries are based on. It is a question of the utmost interest to all of us and all of our citizens.

 Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear: if one of the groups here in the House or one of our more than 100 political groupings had written the Charter, it would have be very different on a great many points. But that is all by the by. What we needed was a European consensus and that is what we have got. This is the most modern fundamental rights document in the world today and it really does deserve our special appreciation. As far as I can see, the convention has extracted everything worth its weight in fundamental rights from over 31 legal sources. It has clarified the bedrock of values of the European Union and I call on all those who have spoken and who, for example miss the lack of political responsibility in the Charter – heaven forbid – to appreciate the fact that, as stated in the preamble, this text has been formulated in an awareness of the spiritual, religious and moral heritage of the Union. Allow me to make one further point. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to secure sufficient coverage in the Charter for the rights of minorities. The European Parliament delegation wanted to take account of ethnic minorities but failed to persuade the convention as a whole. In my view this is a failing and it should have been mentioned. And a word to our critics. It is standard practice for journalists to criticise politicians. That is all well and good and that is how it should be, but I should like to turn the tables for once and give our critics, i.e. the journalists, a taste of their own medicine: you have failed right along the line. We have been working on this text of fundamental rights publicly and transparently for nine months and the whole of the European press has failed to tell our citizens anything about it.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are also to discuss the Montfort report this week, which Parliament wants to use to promote an entrepreneurial way of thinking. It is therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three things in this debate. Firstly, the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights has now been drafted, Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom. Of course, this right demands strict competition law, because only this will guarantee fair competition. It protects consumers and investors. Secondly, it is only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by Karel van Miert, which tells us about the means employed by entrepreneurs to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneurs. Thirdly therefore, I would like to congratulate the Commission and its staff on the actions and decisions they have taken in the field of competition law, previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control, Professor Monti. Against this background, you have reworked a communication on services of general interest and set out the legal situation once again. This statement contains three important messages. Firstly, the Member States have the right to define everything that belongs under this heading. Secondly, the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities. And thirdly – and this is highly relevant to this debate – there must of course be no areas which are exempt from competition law. It is therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble. It must not annul the general validity of Community law. Hence those articles in the motions for resolutions which point to this fact, including the need for transparency, are particularly valuable. Professor Monti, I would like to make a suggestion in this respect. You really ought to clarify, at an earlier stage, that start-up aid – the administration of which varies substantially from Member State to Member State, in the sphere of renewable energies for example – will enjoy confidentiality protection, at least for the duration of its lifetime, even if, in the meantime – which is what I am hoping will happen – the Union as a whole upgrades its support measures.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the approval of the courts in Luxembourg and Strasbourg, the Convention has put together a draft Charter of Fundamental Rights which is remarkably balanced, and has delivered it into the hands of the Council. Where does the added value of this Charter lie? Firstly, it lies in the fact that a basic set of fundamental rights has been distilled from more than 30 legal sources which are currently in force. Secondly, it lies in its transparency for the public, who now know what rights they have in respect of those who create and apply European law, and in its transparency for those who do precisely that, draft or apply European law. They too now have a clear idea of the rights which they have to respect. Thirdly, the Convention has not confined itself to restating old rights – even the Council of Europe has recognised this – but has identified new dangers in connection with old rights and included them in the text: in the areas of crime, biotechnology, data protection and administration. The Charter therefore guarantees a greater level of protection than the European Convention on Human Rights – this needs to be said to all those who are asserting the opposite here in the plenary – and it formulates political and social rights in a balanced way. It is the first declaration of human rights of the new millennium and the most modern charter of human rights available anywhere in the world. It makes it clear to people that the European Union has always been a Community of values. Even so, the EU will have to do a great deal to keep it that way. Mr President-in-Office, I would ask you in all seriousness just to consider the following: if you now wish simply to go back to the Cologne Decision and reflect at your leisure on whether this should be incorporated into the Treaties, what encouragement will those who disregard human rights draw from the fact that we are hesitating to do this? What Mr Baron Crespo said is right: why waste time? All this is about, after all, is making law which is already in force more visible.

Mr President, the gas and electricity market is, without doubt, essential both to Europe's competitiveness and to environmental protection. We have drafted a report in response to four Commission documents, the basic aim of which is to make one overall market out of fifteen individual markets. As rapporteur for the committee, I should like to draw the House's attention to a number of points, Mr President, but perhaps you will allow me to stop for a moment because Madam Vice-president has just joined us. I repeat, the basic aim of our report is to respond to four Commission documents and to make one overall gas and electricity market out of fifteen individual markets. The committee has identified a number of points here, which I should like to list. First, the Union citizens' right to freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services has so far only been partially implemented. We advise that this implementation be accelerated. Secondly, we welcome the fact that suppliers are forming new structures and we call on the Commission in its capacity as the competition authority, in collaboration with the national mergers and monopolies commissions, to ensure that new monopolies do not emerge, that new suppliers have free access to the grid, that exchanges are set up and that consumers can change their supplier. Thirdly, we are concerned about security of supply and consider that great care should be taken to ensure that the Member States which so wish can impose so-called public-service obligations on the competitors involved. The Treaty contains rules on transparency and clarity in this respect but it also allows the Member States to make their own decision here. We want to ensure that this remains the case. My fourth point concerns regulators. Most, although not all Member States have introduced regulators. We note that, in the countries in which regulators have been introduced, not only large consumers, but also medium-sized and small consumers can take better part in the market and the conditions for using the grid are clearer. Perhaps we need to reconsider if the negotiated network access model is the right approach, because it makes life easy for large consumers but difficult for medium-sized consumers and may be an instrument which hampers the European market as a whole. Fifthly, the grids are the central market place for the markets. We therefore need free access, and that means that tariffs must give the market the right signal of non-discriminatory access for everyone and – and this is the purpose of the so-called Florence process – good cross-border tariffs must be set which allow cross-border trade. A model has been worked out here whereby the costs of cross-border trade are paid into funds. The money is paid in by the national grid operators and paid out to those providing through lines. Commissioner, Madam Vice-president, I have two comments to make on this. First, we feel that the costs calculated by the grid operators appear to have been plucked out of thin air. We need to examine these costings closely in order to ensure that they are not completely out of line. Secondly, the costs included in the tariffs must be sure to give the market the right incentive, i.e. they must cover all losses and encourage investment. That is an important point in this process. Sixthly: not all cross-border services have the necessary capacity. This needs to be calculated and, if necessary, rectified or allocated in accordance with the markets, perhaps by auction. Then there are two more points which I should like to address. We hope to discuss with the Commission in committee exactly how imports of gas and electricity from the Central and Eastern European countries are to be dealt with, because we do not want to damage our own gas and electricity market in Europe by accepting different safety standards or the wrong competition terms. Finally, in the case of electricity, transmission system operators have formed an association and it was with the help of this association that results were achieved in Florence. We call on the Commission to use its influence and to take its own action to form a similar association for gas transmission system operators so that results similar to those achieved in Florence can be achieved in Madrid in the parallel process for the gas sector.

 Mr President, in its wisdom, the House has made a decision on Friday sittings. I should like to suggest that those responsible ensure that, even if no sittings are held on a Friday, official cars are still made available, because there will be many Members who will, in any case, wish to make full use of the Thursday here and who will need to have some way of reaching the airport or the railway station on the Friday.

Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has basically been in agreement on this question since 1996. It was Parliament, may I remind you, which had to push the previous Commission in the direction of this policy. It did not start with the White Paper, but with an initiative by Parliament, and I remember because I was the rapporteur at the time. We need a much higher proportion of primary energy used. We have already come a long way, but not far enough by a long chalk. We need it for climatic reasons and for industrial policy reasons, because there is a global market to fill here. In this respect, I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of the committee and note that, consequently, 80% of the resolutions tabled are therefore uncontested. For the rest, an aside: everyone still here this evening must have not renewable sources of energy but an inexhaustible supply of energy! We are represented in accordance with the subject matter! Unfortunately, I note that the report contains a number of statements which are incorrect, which violate the Treaty or which are politically untenable. For example, elevating the feed-in system to a universal panacea is wrong. It is true, of course, that the countries with feed-in systems have made a great deal of progress, but that is not on account of the feed-in system but because of the financing which is in place there. We must make a distinction between these causes. As a result, we and the Commission are of the opinion that the Member States should now be allowed to experiment. It is too early to see one system as a universal panacea and dismiss another. Secondly, the report also contradicts the Treaty at certain points. This applies in particular to the statements on aid policy. It is true that renewable energy needs aid now, and probably will for some time to come, in order to get started. That is quite right and it complies with the Treaty. But it is certainly not right to give them the same aid as all other forms of energy because they make a totally different contribution to the energy mix, and it is not right to link aid for one to the lifetime of the others. My third comment also concerns a point at which the resolution does not comply with the Treaty. We here in the European Union cannot impose mandatory obligations on the Member States. The European Union has no legal basis and no credentials for doing so and, because of that, it cannot impose sanctions. Anyway, that is precisely what the Lisbon Council has just agreed to reject in connection with the job markets. That is why it is right to regard this as a matter of economic policy of common interest; hence the burden sharing negotiations. More importantly, I cannot agree when there is talk of the curse of the lowest bidder. Statements like this show disdain for the consumer and disregard the principle of supply and demand. In addition, as I am sure you will understand, we cannot get excited about new forms of bureaucracy, even if it comes along in the jewel-studded cloak of an EU agency. That is why, Madam Vice-President, I have three recommendations to make to the Commission. First: you should use your directive, the draft of which we are waiting for, to promote the use of all renewable sources of energy and, if possible, you could suggest a uniform development framework. Secondly: as far as financial assistance is concerned, a distinction should be made between everyone and those who need this financial assistance. The distinction is easy to make. Thirdly, and I consider this extremely important in the interests of investors: if a new system should replace the systems currently being tried out in Europe, either in the Member States or in the Union, it should not, of course, penalise those who have already made investments. They need permanent protection. We want both the competition and energy departments of the Commission to make a clear statement on that to the markets.

 Mr President, thank you very much. Parliament has taken receipt of a report on this subject produced under the tutelage of Mr Chichester and I would like to congratulate him on it. It is a good report. Another way in which the European Union seeks to further environmental policy in the field of energy is by setting up programmes promoting the efficiency of installations. But I want to again make clear today that the most important environmental policy measure we have taken to date was when we abolished the monopolies and introduced competition in the directives on gas and electricity of 1996 and 1998. For it is only under such circumstances that the former monopolies are forced to shut down all their unprofitable installations and pass the consequences of this onto the consumer in terms of costs. Only now do they have an incentive to operate their installations as efficiently as possible. I also want to draw your attention to one aspect in particular. It is only when a sector opens up to competition that variable rates can be set, something we are all familiar with in the case of the telecommunications sector. Variable rates will lead to consumption over a 24 hour period being corrected and as such better use will be made of the installation capacity and fewer installations will be required. In other words, it will not be necessary to produce as much energy and that is the most significant contribution to environmental policy to come out of these directives. Hence the observation, incidentally, that the deliberations put forward by the previous Commission on the so-called integrated resources planning – an expression I really dislike – will die a death for this very reason, because there is no need for regulation. For the energy suppliers and distributors will endeavour of their own accord to manage demand appropriately. When it came to adopting the directives, the PPE Group stressed that as far as we were concerned there was still a lack of harmonisation of environmental policies. That is why we have this report before us today, and we await further initiatives from the Commission. I would also like to remind you that these directives provide for priority regulations with respect to the supply of electricity from renewable energies and combined heat and power systems. These will all be of obvious benefit to the environment. What we still lack though and what the previous Commission failed to achieve, and what we hope will be achieved in the end, is a European directive which does not just provide for the regulation in technical terms of the supply of electricity from renewable energy, but which also clearly sets out, in accordance with European competition law, models that show how electricity produced by this method can be promoted in a manner which meets Community requirements. I see Mr Linkohr sitting just across the way. We were unable to support the proposal he put forward at the time in every last detail, but we are agreed on the line of approach, i.e. that European legislation must be drawn up in this area. I would also like to say in this context that we are soon to enter into very careful deliberations with the Commission, in Committee, on what else needs to be done in regulatory terms in the field of gas and electricity, for contrary to all declarations, we still do not have a European market, to a large extent we still have 15 individual markets. This situation must change! Finally, I would like to make an observation of a rather personal nature. Whosoever believes that environmental protection can be achieved by introducing a CO2-tax will find no credence with me at any rate. This is a quote from the Secretary-General of the IAEO who recently held forth before us all, stating that he knew of no examples to support the contention that linking taxation with the emission of harmful substances really does make a difference in terms of less energy being used and achieving reductions in the emission of harmful substances. Consequently, and until there is evidence to the contrary, I will continue to regard all deliberations in respect of CO2 as nothing more than an increase in taxation by the backdoor, and I personally would only be prepared to support this if other taxes were to be cut in advance, rather than just an announcement made.  (Applause)

 Mr President, you have had a declaration distributed to us and a trial vote has subsequently taken place. The name of the candidate selected is visible and is also emphasised by the asterisk. I should be grateful if you could explain to us how, under the circumstances, we are to vote in secret. I regard it as being anything but a secret ballot and wish to contest its legitimacy before we go any further. It is illegal.

Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in the third report on economic and social cohesion, the right path has been chosen, leading to a reformed European cohesion policy with a new architecture and targeted interventions. The fact that 78% of the financial resources for the reduction of disparities and the improvement of competitiveness factors have been earmarked for the least advanced regions shows that this is a move in the right direction – away from the scattergun approach to support funding towards the targeted use of resources. Equally right is the decision to accord equal treatment to the regions that are subject to the statistical effect in the framework of the new convergence objective. We particularly welcome this proposal, provided that it also guarantees adequate funding as envisaged in the communication from the Commission for the period after 2006. For the sake of fair treatment of the areas subject to the statistical effect in relation to the traditional Objective 1 regions, there must be no further budget cuts or dilution of support. I therefore wish to refer at this point to last September’s parliamentary resolution based on the Mastorakis report. The resolution not only emphasised the need to pay special attention to the level of support given to those regions suffering from the statistical effects of enlargement but also stressed that the Commission should focus the same attention on the administration of aid to these regions. Parliament voted by a large majority in favour of aid under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, and that should be taken into account. We therefore expect the Directorate-General for Competition, even before presenting the drafts for the regulation on the structural funds, to present its proposal for guidelines on regionally targeted aid, which should take due account of the parliamentary vote, for we must beware of narrowly focusing aid and support measures on the acceding countries, which would ultimately subsidise tax dumping in those countries and would only lead to job losses in the existing EU Member States as companies moved their production facilities from the West to the new Member States in the East. It would be unacceptable to invest European resources if a one-sided aid regime meant that the only return was the relocation of existing jobs.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I see the Second progress report on economic and social cohesion as a valuable, up-dated analysis of the current situation and of the possible future direction of cohesion policy in the enlarged Union. The compromise that was reached after lengthy discussions with the rapporteur and the adoption of numerous amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is to be welcomed, and as the report now stands it should achieve a majority in the House. I am thinking here both of the budget for cohesion policy of 0.45% of GDP and of keeping Objective 1 areas as the main focus of our support. I welcome the threshold of 75% of GDP per head at NUTS II level being retained as the main criterion for determining Objective 1 status, provided that at the same time the so-called statistical effect is neutralised. We are all aware that at the end of the current support period those regions affected by the statistical effect will not of course have exceeded the 75% threshold in the present EU. Overnight, or to be more precise between 30 April and 1 May next year, a stroke of a mathematical pen will turn poor wretches into wealthy people, although they will not have a cent more to their name. That is the so-called statistical effect. These regions continue to require resources from the Structural Funds to consolidate and further the process of economic and social convergence, which they have begun so successfully in previous support periods. That is why the report clearly underlines, on the basis of our amendments submitted in the committee, that particular attention must be paid to the regions suffering from the impact of these statistical changes, and that in the future too these areas should be treated as similar to Objective 1 areas with the equivalent level of support and with the aid administered in accordance with Article 87, paragraph 3(a). Existing transitional arrangements – phasing out – do not do justice to the specific problems of these areas caught by the statistical effect. The report, as it stands, should also find the support of the majority of this House.

 Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is four and a half years since the European single currency, the euro, first saw the light of day with an exchange rate of 1.17 to the dollar, which was, at that time, intended to adequately reflect price levels on the two sides of the Atlantic. Since then, as we know, the euro's exchange rate has followed a roller coaster course. At present, it has returned to its starting point. But, basically speaking, we Europeans should not be too concerned about the euro exchange rate, because no one can explain or even predict short-term exchange rate fluctuations between one day and six months. We should instead be focussing on economic problems, which are more important, and leave exchange rate trends to the foreign currency markets. Even if public acceptance of the euro has increased, the most recent polls carried out by opinion research organisations indicate, for example, that in many Germans’ thinking, the Deutschmark is still very much alive. That this should be so was, however, totally predictable and should by no means be seen in a negative light. The increasing public acceptance of the euro is a gradual process and can in no way diminish the impact of this key event in monetary policy in the history of the continent of Europe. As far as withdrawals from cash machines are concerned, I support the rapporteur's view that we need more smaller-denomination banknotes, that is, 5-euro and 10-euro notes. I am, however, rather more critical about the idea of setting up a working party to investigate the need for a 1-euro banknote. The most recent opinion polls confirm that in Germany at least there is widespread opposition to this idea. There, for example, 79% of the population clearly rejects this low denomination note, with only 16% in favour of introducing it. Even if opinion polls are not the be-all and end-all, this result nevertheless seems to clearly confirm that the public, at least in Germany, does not see any need for such a note. In short, the answer to the question ‘Do we need a 1 euro note alongside the 1 euro coin?’ is very definitely ‘no’. The euro denominations currently in circulation are fine.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even if this is just an interim report to be produced every three years, it should be used not just to take stock, but also to give an overview of the next planning period. It is quite right not to go into detail and not to give precise figures, but the key points need to be identified and central issues need to be resolved in good time. One of these central issues is the 0.45% share of the Union’s GDP set aside for cohesion policy, which may not be exceeded even during EU enlargement. Another central issue is treating the regions as a reference unit for cohesion policy tasks and not nation-state criteria. Anyone who would like to see anything else is missing the point. A further central issue is the concentration of support on disadvantaged regions in an enlarged EU with clear, transparent and quantifiable criteria for the concept of ‘poor regions’. These and these alone can be dependent on the 75% criterion. Any other factors taken as a basis for measurement cannot be clearly quantified and open the way to arbitrary decision-making. This even applies to a criterion such as unemployment, for which there is no EU-wide definition and which is therefore bound to lead to inaccurate estimates. When it comes to supporting disadvantaged regions, we first need to consider those regions with less than 75% of EU GDP. But those regions that will be lifted over the 75% threshold after enlargement, becoming ‘statistically wealthy’, also need to have a more generous phasing-out arrangement. We wish to see regions receiving more support the closer they are to the 75% threshold. In this respect I agree with the rapporteur, who has tabled an amendment on this point.

Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the floods that hit Central Europe this August reached alarming proportions. They claimed numerous lives and inflicted massive physical damage. Entire regions and cities were devastated, and entire rural areas and cultural heritage monuments sustained severe damage. The extent of the destruction triggered a great wave of sympathy across Europe, and the desire to be able to provide assistance, also at EU level, to the countries concerned in mastering the countless problems they face quickly became apparent. Commissioner, the local populations gratefully recall that only days after the disaster occurred, you and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, visited the regions affected to see the extent of the damage for yourselves. However, they were not only grateful, they were also hopeful. Your visit raised their hopes that in such a case, the EU would intervene. Until now, there have been no suitable instruments for this purpose at Community level, for as we know, an EU relief fund once existed, but was discontinued in 1998. As the rapporteur, I view the establishment of this new solidarity instrument as an important complement to the Structural Funds. It equips the EU with a flexible instrument with which to cut through red tape, which enables us to provide rapid on-the-spot assistance when disasters occur. The purpose of the Fund – which will be focused on immediate financial assistance – is to help the people, regions and countries return to normal living conditions as quickly as possible. Its scope will therefore be limited to the most urgent needs. The long-term reconstruction of infrastructures and businesses must be left to other instruments, and this EU aid will add to, not replace, the efforts of the countries concerned. The EUR 1 billion designated for this fund are 'floating': in other words, they are not earmarked for a specific budget line, but will be mobilised only when a disaster occurs. The Commissioner has rightly asked the question: What kind of disaster can this Fund be used for? By defining a major disaster as any disaster resulting in damage estimated at over EUR 1 billion or more than 0.5% of GDP, this should ensure that claims on the fund are restricted to very exceptional damage. That is why the committee agreed, by a majority, on a definition that refers to 'major disasters'. We have deliberately refrained from making any reference to natural, environmental, or technological disasters. After all, what would we say to the people concerned if the European Union were hit by a disaster such as 11 September in New York, on a scale which claimed a similar numbers of casualties? Faced with this scenario, we cannot say to people: Sorry, the EU is unable to help because this is not a natural disaster! We should stick with the term 'major disasters' as well as the three-month deadline for the submission of applications for assistance from the Fund, as this is in line with the principles of urgency and immediate rapid assistance which underpin the Fund. As regards the availability of the financial resources granted, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which is the committee responsible, I call for a timeframe of two years so that the Fund can provide aid to restore immediately key infrastructures such as energy, water supply and treatment, communication, transport, health and education. The funds should also be used to provide auxiliary services, as well as to safeguard security infrastructures, take immediate measures to protect cultural heritage and clean up damaged natural areas, buildings and cities, and carry out emergency short-term repairs to dams. The stipulation that this grant must leave available 25% of the annual amount of EUR 1 billion allocated to the Fund up to 1 October each year in order to respond to disasters possibly occurring late on in the calendar year is supported by the committee responsible. Although the parliamentary procedure for the preparation and debate of this report is not without its problems due to the very tight timetable, I believe that the accelerated procedure adopted in this instance due to its particular urgency, with the aim of disbursing EUR 1 billion in November, if at all possible, is acceptable in this exceptional case. I think we should proceed as swiftly as possible. The people affected are waiting for assistance from the European Union. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to talk about the administration of the EU structural fund, something which is more than in need of improvement. This is not only in the light of enlargement, as the 12th Annual Report on the Structural Funds 2000, the Cohesion Fund and the Instrument for Structural Policy for Pre-Accession shows, as the rapporteur has rightly said, that there is substantial underutilisation of commitment and payment appropriations. Despite the lowering of targets, concentration and simplification of planning, take up of the new forms of intervention for the structural fund planning period has been much slower than was intended and was desirable. Even if EU Finance Ministers are currently pleased at every euro that is not spent at EU level, since it eases the burden of the EU Member States’ net payments in the short term, they are economising in the wrong place because EU money is urgently needed especially in times of rising unemployment. The reasons for the difficulties must be sought both in the Member States and in the EU Commission. In some cases there is a shortage of suitable projects. Not infrequently the problem is the necessary cofinancing. But appreciable administrative bottlenecks are also a reason why the Member States are unable to take up funding. According to the Annual Report 2000, not one intervention was approved in connection with the new Community initiatives, and as a result 0% of the budget plan was implemented in this area. That is atrocious! In future, the Commission must ensure that the new planning period starts on time and it must insist that the Member States do their groundwork early. On the other hand, the Commission must also intensify its scrutiny of the implementation of programmes and inform the European Parliament in good time of all irregularities found.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Culture 2000 programme – as this good report establishes very graphically – does not only make clear the increasing need for culture, but also makes a contribution towards the creation of a unitary cultural area. The report, though, shows just as clearly that this programme is marked by a disparity between the wealth of its objectives on the one hand and the astonishing poverty of its budget on the other. The rapporteur is right to highlight the explicit recognition of culture as an economic factor and also as a factor in social integration and citizenship. As with so many other programmes, for example, within the regional policy framework – which is not to excuse it – it cannot but be noted that the first two years were characterised by the late appearance of calls for proposals. Indeed, I will at this point use the same words as the rapporteur, who speaks of ‘chaotic programme management’, in these first two years. At the end of the day, Culture 2000's low level of implementation during its first year of operation can be attributed to that and to lengthy and cumbersome internal procedures. This is where, in my view, the Commission has to make real efforts to shorten the cycle of the projects and guarantee the programme's continuity. In conclusion, I would like to pick out from this report's Explanatory Statement a question that particularly interests me as a regional politician and put it to the Commission. It is this: How can the necessary complementarity and coordination be established between Culture 2000 and the resources of the Structural Funds allocated to culture in the Member States? That might be an interesting angle, and one to which we might give some thought.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report is concerned with analysing problems in the use actually made of the Structural Funds and with submitting proposals as to how their management and effectiveness could be improved, not least with a view to the next pending revision of post-2006 regional policy. The rapporteur has succeeded both in highlighting the improvements achieved in the wake of the 2000 reform of the Structural Funds and also in drawing our attention to difficulties in their application, especially the problems in connection with the delayed implementation of the programme. It is these to which I wish to give particular attention. Although it was an essential objective of the pre-2000 reform of the Structural Funds to avoid repetition of mistakes from the beginning of the 1994 planning period, but rather to get fully involved in the first year, this has only partly succeeded. Negotiations on the programme still took up too much time. The guidelines set out by the Commission were not always understood in the regions. Negotiations were often delayed through the pace at which the Commission worked and through slow response times, which were sometimes contingent on new requirements imposed by the Commission. It is reported from the regions that these in turn were seen there as merely petty. On the other hand, the Member States were not always prompt in sending in the programme documents and the additional items of information that had been requested. All these things, Mr President, are facts – facts of which I had warned when I was the rapporteur presenting an own-initiative report in the same terms, appealing urgently for the start of a new planning period not to again be delayed as it had been in 1994. Let us then now draw the right and necessary conclusions for 2006, or else reports of that sort will in fact be nothing more than wastepaper. There should be no gaps occurring between programming periods. That is why I support the rapporteur's proposal that we should also examine whether in future there should not also be separation and limitation of the periods for which project-oriented programmes and Community initiatives run.

Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations first to Mr Musotto on a fine report, and I say this against the backdrop of the harsh criticism by the Greens, whose attitude I do not share. I would like, in my contribution to this discussion, to focus on the future of regional policy. Reference has already been made several times this evening to the reconciliation of two fundamental needs with each other, which must be possible, with a high degree of solidarity towards the new Member States on the one hand, but also, on the other, solidarity with those regions that are at present lagging behind or undergoing economic transition. To put it another way, even if it is generally acknowledged that the regions in all the applicant countries must be supported as a matter of priority, the ‘Objective 1’ regions of the present fifteen Member States, which will, in the course of enlargement, lose their eligibility for support only because of their relatively high standard of living in an enlarged EU, that is, only by dint of the cosmetic use of statistics, should not overnight be excluded from any opportunity to be supported. Commissioner, it will be necessary over the coming months to discuss how to guarantee equal treatment of these regions, which have yet to complete the process of economic convergence, with the areas being embraced by enlargement. Political and economic considerations mean that future cohesion policy must not concentrate exclusively on regions whose development is lagging furthest behind, but it must also take into account the advantages and disadvantages in urban areas, in areas undergoing socio-economic change, in regions with permanent natural disadvantages and also the cross-border dimension. The financial means this policy needs must of course be made available. The present threshold of 0.45% of Community GDP must therefore not fall any lower – that too was mentioned several times this evening – in order that cohesion policy may not be jeopardised. At the present time, we have in any case not yet exhausted the possibilities open to us. Everything else must be tested by reference to the new financial framework and in the light of the results of enlargement. I therefore think it inappropriate to be already, as a precaution, articulating demands for the replenishment of funds.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, as being sensible and clear in terms of both statistics and administration. However, we must ensure that any amendment to the classification also requires the prior approval of the Member States. We must also ensure that the definition of employment market regions under the ‘shared-task’ mechanism can also deviate from NUTS level III in future. The two-year period provided for between an amendment to NUTS being accepted and coming into force should either be significantly reduced or else totally dropped, as Commission financial support for the Member States can depend on the regional structure. Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the Commission proposal, and would in fact be happier without the rapporteur's amendments that were adopted by a majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Although I said ‘by a majority’, they were in fact adopted unanimously with one abstention, and that abstention was mine. I voted against certain amendments in committee. This was because the report repeatedly referred to the adoption of additional criteria for the definition of regions as an objective. I regard that as a problem, as taking account of, say, economic, geographical and social criteria in the case of non-administrative units will lead to a blurring of these clear criteria. I believe that a key criterion for the definition of regions should be the number of people living in a region, as in the final analysis they are affected by any decisions regarding the NUTS classification. When the rapporteur says in one recital that there should be at least three hierarchical levels, the use of that little phrase ‘at least’ implies that further levels ought to be created for classifying territorial units. However, it needs to be borne in mind that the introduction of new statistics for the areas affected would involve a significant additional administrative burden, something that I believe should if anything be limited.

 Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will first address a word of thanks to you, Commissioner, for your lucid words and your declaration that, in the context of economic and social cohesion, both the new problems of the candidates for accession and the continuing problems of the present 15 Member States are being appropriately taken into account in various regions. Secondly, a word of thanks also for emphasising again that there are no taboos in this discussion. We are at the beginning of this discussion process and, in this discussion, we should explore in depth all the options for auditing the Structural Funds. Holding 27 countries together economically and socially is a quite different matter from maintaining the cohesion of 15 of them. The solid fact is that the accession of 12 new States will substantially increase the disparities in the EU. On the one hand, the new Member States will have to be given priority, whilst on the other, the present beneficiary countries must not be denied a degree of continuity. We are well aware that the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund can still only be temporary measures and cannot be made part of the patrimony. However, regions must not lose their Objective 1 status after 2006 solely on the grounds that enlargement has brought an improvement in their relative position and without their having achieved sustainable development. I see the cohesion policy as being credible only if the financial means are apportioned on the basis of objective criteria applicable to all, with the criteria of national and regional prosperity forming the bases. The pending review of European regional policy must therefore throw up some solutions, and that is the whole point of the discussion process that is now beginning – to treat on an equal footing the situations both in the new Member States and in the Objective 1 regions of the present Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of annual reports is to carry out analyses over a limited period and draw conclusions from them. This 11th Annual Report on the Structural Funds relates to a year which is undoubtedly very important for the development of the European Union's cohesion policies. My group supports the rapporteur on some of the proposed measures and options to improve the management of the Structural Funds, such as speeding up the implementation of approved measures, concentrating assistance in areas whose development is lagging behind or improving on-the-spot checks to combat what is still a very high level of fraud. However, we also have some criticisms. We should point out that we do not endorse some of the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, such as the overly negative assessment of the Structural Fund results during the planning period and the failure to meet the regional policy objective of harmonising living conditions, which has supposedly only been achieved in part. I would say to the rapporteur that he has adopted the wrong approach to European structural policy, whose task is solely to reduce disparities and which I believe has generally achieved this goal. In fact, there will always be a discrepancy between living conditions in the rich and poor regions of the EU, and even within Member States. We are daydreaming if we expect harmonisation from the structural policies. We should not confuse achievable goals with a wish list here. My second point of criticism is that despite all the significance of 1999, the 11th Report is an annual report and not a storehouse catalogue in which all the concerns and problems faced by the European Union in the past, present and future have to be rolled out yet again. If reports are to achieve anything, they must focus on specific priorities, as we all know from our years of practical experience here in Parliament. This is precisely what this report does not do. As I said, the rapporteur's conclusions are not necessarily wrong, but much of what is included in the report really does not need to be there. That is why we believe that some of the points raised in the report need to be amended by the plenary.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to bolster the competitiveness of Europe in the world economy, the Union supports the transition of businesses and regional authorities to operational methods based on knowledge and technological innovation. The immensity of this task must not be underestimated, since the less prosperous regions are already lagging far behind in innovation, research and development in the various fields of new technology. This very technology, on the other hand, presents them with a means of making up the leeway, provided that the economic players in the regions are capable of using innovative measures to grasp the opportunities available to them. The fact is that the technological gap between prosperous and backward regions is considerably greater than the difference between their respective Gross Domestic Products. Unfortunately, as in the last planning period, expectations will far exceed the available funding framework of EUR 400 million. Without adequate funding, these measures simply cannot achieve the desired results. For that reason, the allocation must not, on any account, be reduced further still. The innovative measures would then generate more frustration than enthusiasm. We should spell that out very clearly. The main aspects of the Markov report, which analyses the situation properly and arrives at the right conclusions, can be commended to the House. It is a good report, based on a good paper from the Commission. On one point, however, I tend to support the line taken by the Commission. I cannot endorse the rapporteur's expression of regret that the Commission has opted against a project-based approach and in favour of a programme-based approach, to be implemented by the national and regional authorities. On the contrary, I see this as an opportunity to shift a greater share of responsibility to the local level and to allow project operators more latitude. Contrary to what the report concludes, I do not believe that this would automatically result in a loss of any European added value. With these guidelines, an experimental laboratory, as Commissioner Barnier put it, really can be developed, enabling the regions to test new ideas and to convert the most successful of these into standard practices.

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now to be enshrined in law that summer time, which without a doubt has proved its worth, will begin on the last Sunday in March and end on the last Sunday in October throughout Europe. These provisions are contained in the Commission proposal on summer time arrangements. In addition, for the first time the directive is to remain in force indefinitely. This is necessary and good. The Commission is simply required to report on the impact of the directive after five years. It is absolutely essential to the smooth functioning of European industry, particularly in the fields of transport, communication, tourism and IT, that it have a stable and long-term framework in which to plan. Countless statements from industrial sectors show that this long-term stability of summer time dates is urgently necessary for the harmonious functioning of the internal market. For economic and social reasons it is simply imperative that the summer time arrangements are clear, comprehensible and long-term, so that people can plan ahead and do not need to worry that one day this policy will suddenly be reversed. The amendments which have been tabled by Parliament and the rapporteur are therefore, in my opinion, unhelpful, because they tend to create uncertainty rather than increase confidence. A one-off review by the Commission in five years' time will suffice. I would therefore urge Members to adopt the same stance in Parliament as was adopted in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, namely to confirm the Commission proposal as it stands and thus reject the amendments.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can safely say, from what we have heard this morning, that extremism and racism are two of the most important issues we have to deal with at present. The past few months in particular have seen a whole spate of racially motivated criminal acts in Germany. The events that took place in Dessau, Munich, Ludwigshafen, Düsseldorf are of such concern to us primarily because violent acts were committed against defenceless people with great indifference and coldbloodedness. The fact that the crimes were committed in all these different places, however, shows that racism and right-wing extremism are not problems specific to East Germany, but are to be found throughout Germany, indeed throughout Europe. It does not help matters though, Mrs Schroedter and also Mr Schulz, to want to concentrate on tackling this problem in the new German Länder, singling these regions out for attention. It is true that the propaganda peddled by these groups, which have long been active in the old Länder, has, I regret to say, fallen on fertile ground in the new Länder in recent years, and that we undoubtedly need to take appropriate action. But hysteria makes for a poor counsellor. What we need is to show a united front in the fight against violence, but also to have faith and confidence in the ability of state and society to rid us of this monster. It is in no one’s interests to assert that over 10% of people in the new Bundesländer are of a racist disposition, or to disparage them as such. 16 million citizens cannot, and will not, allow themselves to be labelled as such all because of the activities of an extremist minority. Our citizens have done nothing to deserve this, and nor, more to the point, have our young people, the vast majority of whom are tolerant and open-minded. I would expressly like to draw attention to the various actions undertaken by the inhabitants of the new Bundesländer over the past few weeks and months, which have demonstrated repeatedly that they feel a great deal of solidarity with the victims of these crimes, and that we will not tolerate xenophobic machinations and acts of violence in our country.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progress Greece has made in its endeavours to fulfil the convergence criteria is indeed impressive. It bears witness to this country’s desire to become a member of euroland, sparing no effort along the way. I am in favour of treating all countries equally when it comes to forming an assessment of the criteria. In other words, whilst I approve of Greece joining the euro zone overall, I have definite reservations when it comes to the results we are considering at present.   The inflation criterion and the debt situation certainly give cause for concern. Greece has only been able to achieve the reference value for the permissible inflation rate in the last few months. No stone was left unturned in order to attain this objective, which begs the question as to whether the currency stability that has now been achieved can be secured in the long term or, put another way: how do matters actually stand on the sustainability front? Another worrying aspect is the total debt situation, which, being in excess of 100% of GNP, as compared with the reference value of 60%, is far too high. We must also take into account the fact that the current free-fall of the euro is not exactly favouring a sustained reduction in Greece’s state debt, and the anticipated medium-term rise in the level of interest rates is unlikely to help matters either.   Let us be clear about one thing where this decision is concerned: the financial markets immediately draw their own conclusions about the forthcoming enlargement eastwards. Therefore, the standard we set for all the euro aspirants amongst the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must not be so much as a fraction higher than the standard we are currently setting for Greece. And so we should be careful not to be over-generous in our interpretation of these results. They constitute – and I would emphasise this again – a hard-won snapshot of the situation and qualify Greece for membership by right. In short, a ‘yes’ vote must be qualified with an equally clear ‘however’.

 Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made. Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes. However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission’s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas. Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields. I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects. I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.

 Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the sixth periodic report contains a comprehensive and detailed description of the economic and social situation in the Union’s regions and of their development trends and represents, as I see it, a solid basis for the formulation of structural policy priorities at Union level. The report demonstrates that – measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita – the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue. This can largely be attributed to the structural funds, even though the disparity between the poorest and wealthiest regions is still considerable. Employing European structural funds has already enabled convergence in standards of living. Over a ten year period, the gap in average GDP has been reduced by ten percent. This has particularly affected the four cohesion countries – in the positive sense of course – as it has the five former East German Länder. Unfortunately, this European-wide development was due, in the main, to an increase in productivity and only partly to an increase in the level of employment. Hence we would urge the Commission and the Member States to give due attention to the effect measures have on employment in future. The lion’s share of the transfer payments has been, and still is, used for investment in rationalisation and modernisation, with the intention of improving labour productivity. However, this has dampened the effect of structural policy on employment. This is not an assessment but, for the moment, merely an observation.  The report establishes, however, that regional differences in the labour market have, in fact, continued to increase. Unemployment is currently at 24% in 25 of the weakest regions. Ten years ago it was 4% lower, i.e. 20%. And I might just mention that in the 25 best regions unemployment averages 3.6%; it was 2.5% ten years ago, hence there has been an increase of only 1.1%. The report makes clear the fact that 50% of unemployment is structural unemployment. That is why – and this is the conclusion we can draw from this report – promoting competitiveness within industry and infrastructure for economic activity must be central to the structural policy, in that order. The corollary to this, it has to be said, is that measures for the retraining and ongoing training of the work force are of no small importance either. In addition, more attention must be given to boosting entrepreneurial potential in small and medium-sized enterprises, and the services they call upon must be developed further.   Another conclusion to be drawn from the report is that if financial support is to be utilised efficiently, then the measures must be brought into line with the broadly diversified means of support intended to establish a middle-class and minimum standard of living. A very important point to my mind. In the conclusions of this report, we make the Commission aware that the legal bases for cooperation between regions and Member States and applicant countries must be improved and point to how crucial it is for the budget to be consolidated, as a prerequisite to the success of economic and monetary union and enlargement eastwards. We call upon those Member States that have not yet submitted a satisfactory map of development regions to do so immediately and, of course, we expect the Commission to examine with due haste the operational programmes for the regions for the new support period 2000 to 2006 in the light of the results of the sixth periodic report, and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those areas where it is needed and in the proper manner.

Mr President, of the great number of problems affecting Rwanda and Burundi I should like on behalf of my Group to speak about the latest events, that is say, what took place on 6 November, i.e. a few days ago, when the Rwanda government announced that it would refuse further cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha. We took some pride in the fact that this Tribunal was set up at all – with our assistance too – whether it was adequate is a more complicated matter – in order to clear up these inhuman crimes and to punish the respective perpetrators. As an initial reaction, this attitude of the Rwandan government is even understandable, but the conclusion that it drew from it, i.e. now to refuse further cooperation with this Tribunal, is entirely the wrong one. We cannot understand – and I express myself carefully here – that the presumed architect of the genocide, Barayagwiza, on the basis of procedural issues – and this is hard to swallow – was released and not brought before the court at all. He was, after all, the political director in the foreign ministry of a regime that was responsible for the deaths of 800 000 people – we should really say for the slaughter of 800 000 people. This person, who has now been released, was a leading official in the state radio at the very time when the radio was urging and inciting people on to racial hatred. Our Group has a two-fold demand: on the one hand to the Rwanda government, to cancel its decision and on the other hand to the Tribunal to revise this decision. In particular, it is not acceptable that the Tribunal refer to the fact that a further charge in the same case is inadmissible owing to the “not guilty” verdict. For charges of this kind there can be no immunity.

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, we are in full agreement with what we have now heard, namely that the decision taken by the Council was premature and false. Now, though, I think we should do everything possible to make the best of it, in the interests of the countries concerned and, above all, of European culture. Much as I would, theoretically speaking, have preferred our Chairman’s clear and purist solution, I nevertheless think it is now time to turn the tables. We should now see this necessary solution not as an emergency measure but as a positive opportunity to set forth Europe’s cultural diversity by having not just one Capital of Culture, but – and why ever not? – two capitals for this great Europe of ours, embracing for the first time East and West and symbolising our cultural diversity. There must then be no distinction between old and new Member States; there must be two equal cities, symbolising the cultural diversity of Europe. What will then be important is that the concept, the vision, that underlies the concept of a European Capital of Culture should play more of a role. This should not just be about cities depicting themselves and their splendid history, their past and their present, but about them putting on show the way in which European history has been made and today’s Europe shaped by them. From this point of view, I do see the resolution we are now adopting as being – if you go back to its origins – a great opportunity for Europe’s cultural diversity.

 Mr President, the issues addressed by these three reports appear at first sight to be of a technical nature. The new Financial Regulation requires specific legal bases, but, as many speakers have pointed out – and I am particularly obliged to the rapporteurs for doing so – this new legal basis does in fact entail far-reaching practical consequences for the individual areas in question. I am speaking primarily about the report on active civic participation. We talk constantly about giving citizens more information about the European process and getting them more involved in it, but I want now to make it abundantly clear that there is a great danger of us, for the sake of the new legal basis and the Financial Regulation, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that we will, next year, be complaining that we have more problems with public information in the year of the European elections than we ever did before. I therefore appeal in urgent terms, particularly to the Commission and to the Council, that greater account be taken of how Parliament votes on these issues, especially as regards the conciliation procedure this coming Monday. Let me give you just two examples. The first is the Info-Points, to which Mrs Rühle was right to make reference, and I also strongly endorse the amendment she has moved. It utterly passes my understanding how the Commission is unwilling to support this amendment. You are all aware that, in our home countries, the Info-Points serve as points of contact for information on Europe and the European institutions. Can you imagine the Info-Points in your region being able to do their job if they were restricted by a call for proposals? This financial insecurity and inadequate institutional backup means that the Info-Points will, in future, be unable to perform their function. That is what the Commission is proposing to us in this report, and so I want to forcefully draw your attention to this danger. The same is true of town twinning, from which all of you, in your regions, receive support in your work. Here too, the bureaucratic process associated with this new legal basis can very much threaten the continuation of the work they do. And so, let me conclude by reiterating my appeal to the Commission and the Council. I urge them to take Parliament’s vote on board and arrive at fair compromises that will guarantee rather than imperil public information in the future!
Hieronymi (PPE-DE

 Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteurs and I would like to concentrate on one question, in fact on the area of culture and Mrs Pack’s report. It goes without saying that we are emphatically in favour of a transparent and secure legal basis, but we must ask ourselves the question here as to what extent a common European cultural policy will in fact still be possible with this procedure, or are we concentrating exclusively on a procedure and the citizens are no longer so important? Take the action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture, for example. There are two funding structures, two sets of rules, one for so-called permanent organisations and one for the second area, which operates by calls. There is no question but that we want to promote as many new initiatives as possible from the existing budget allocations. But the way proposed here and which was in particular decided by the Council at the first reading makes it impossible any longer to include European initiatives that actually deserve such support as permanent bodies. As the report mentions, there is the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, which is supposed to be one of these permanent bodies, but it cannot be the only one in the whole of Europe to have the right to be a permanent body of this kind. The European Youth Orchestra, the Institute in Florence, the Institute in Trier, the College in Bruges: what sort of a proposal are they supposed to make? How many European Youth Orchestras must there be to ensure sufficient support? If there is any doubt, we must join with the Commission in entering into litigation with the Council to really make support for these possible.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly grateful to Mr Perry for his report because, in emphatically demanding the revision of the television directive, he has done so with the objective of maintaining and promoting cultural diversity in Europe in an era of technological convergence. The fact is that content is no longer dependent only on the medium of television, but, in the same way, on many other technological media, and if we want to maintain diversity, we have to find ways whereby we can achieve common rules in this area, which do justice to the various demands, albeit in a slightly different procedure. There are two issues I would like to address, and the first is media pluralism. This Parliament has very emphatically spoken out, most recently on 10 November 2002, in favour of greater support for, and underpinning of, media diversity in Europe and against unhindered media concentration. I would press upon the Commission the urgent need to do what this vote by Parliament demands of it and put before us the pieces of work that we have asked for. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot, however, endorse Amendment No 10, which was tabled today, as it refers exclusively to one instrument, the directive, and because we will achieve a result in this area only if we balance, in an appropriate and proper way, the competences of the Member States and those of the European Union. Considerations of media pluralism therefore demand the solution that we called for in our resolution in November. The second point I want to address is the protection of young people. New technologies require that children and young people be protected in the same way as is provided for in the television directive. Let us therefore work together towards a new system and new ways of self-regulation with minimum standards accepted by all. I wish the Commission much success as it travels down this road.

 Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome this discussion enormously. I also thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, because had it not been for this initiative on the part of Mrs Smet, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport would probably not be in the situation at all where our enquiry is being debated at least in this Parliament. Mrs Pack pointed out that the Committee on Culture has been waiting for months for our questions – just the questions – relating to applying coordination in the field of culture, education, youth, the media and sport to be dealt with here at all. This makes it abundantly clear that something is not right with the system. The debate this evening is an opportunity to lay the issues on the table, and I hope that we will also come to some conclusions. The method of open coordination can certainly make an important contribution to helping us meet the public’s expectations, and to improve coordination in important areas of policy where we do not want harmonisation. In my experience, however, this process will not gain public approval if it is not a democratic process. And to date it has not been democratic; it has been intergovernmental. This is why it is up to us to do something about it. If we believe efficiency to be contradictory to democracy, or flexibility or transparency contradictory to the responsible involvement of Parliament, then this – in my opinion – is indeed a sad reflection on our own shortcomings. This is why I hope that this debate and report can help to ensure that we finish our homework within a few weeks after the conclusion of the Convention, and that this House – and especially the two committees concerned – can respond to these questions.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am able to say, speaking on behalf of my group, that we strongly support this initiative, and I wish, through you, to extend warm thanks to the Commission, which evidently takes the same view. The fact is that it is only together that we can reach the goal that is set before us – that of more protection for the rights of audiovisual artists. I regret the fact that we did not have time to discuss these issues in committee, but time is pressing upon us, 18 June is getting closer, and it is right that we should today send a strong signal of our resolve to see the WIPO Treaties supplemented as soon as possible in order to bridge this gap and finally bring about the legal protection that audiovisual artists need. I would like, therefore, to suggest that the Commission should forward to us, not only here in plenary in good time before the conference, but also after it in the relevant specialist committee, a report on the outcome of the negotiations and on the progress that – it is to be hoped – will have been achieved. Should you come up against serious difficulties in preparing for the conference, I would say that we needed, as soon as the next meeting of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to receive a report on the subject from the Commission, that is to say, one with comprehensive information before and after the deliberations, so that we can in fact take this matter forward. Please allow me to draw your attention to a point that I regard as crucial, but which does not put a question mark against our fundamental support. I refer to the issue of the relationship of artists to those who play the most important part in transmitting their artistic performances, that is, the radio and television stations. It is, I think, something of an over-simplification to say that the radio and television stations do not create works, but do nothing more than consume them. What I would like to make clear in this regard is that what is at issue here is exclusivity. This is, of course, primarily about artists and the protection of their work, and it is precisely that loophole that the law has to close, but I do think that it is also important that we should find a way of bringing on board potentially competing interests, so that they do not, overtly or covertly, tend to prevent us from finding a solution to the problems. So we wish you good luck with the negotiations, and ask that you keep Parliament informed about what comes out of them.

 I approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the EU, even though its accession leaves open questions the resolution of which the European Parliament has demanded, in a spirit of reconciliation, for many years. This is particularly true of what is termed the Immunity Act, No. 115 of 8 May 1946. Any justification that this decree has for its existence will become more speedily and more lastingly obsolete in the EU's common system of law than it would in the event of this application for accession being refused.

 Mr President, I would first like to convey to Mrs De Sarnez my most sincere congratulations. In the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, we all caught from her an enthusiasm for this new and important project, and let me say loud and clear that our discussions of it brought us joy because we had a sense of playing our part in shaping the future. So, as well as extending congratulations, let me also thank the Commission, and Commissioner Reding, for submitting this programme to us, so that together we are making a contribution to investing in Europe's future and in that of the younger generation. I believe that Erasmus World is the logical continuation of the Erasmus programme, with which we are all familiar, and which has helped generations of young Europeans to get to know the other countries of the European Union as well as their own. Erasmus World is now going one step further, both inwards and outwards. Its inward dimension involves something that, even a few years ago, we would have thought impossible, namely that the European Union, and its Member States in particular, are willing, on the basis of their own decisions, of the Bologna Process and the Lisbon resolutions, to cooperate more intensively at university level. An EU quality mark for Masters' courses – excellent! This will bring us closer together, and, together, further forwards. That makes this new programme an important step for us all in improving the situation as regards a shared European education. In its second step, Erasmus World opens the way for postgraduate students from third countries to study at European universities. That is what we want a forward-looking intercultural dialogue to involve. Has there ever been a time when a contribution to this intercultural dialogue was more needed than in the present days and weeks? So let me conclude by appealing to the Council in these terms: you cannot, in view of the terrible conflicts in Iraq, afford not to provide the necessary funds for this programme – which amount to at least the EUR 300 million that Parliament has called for! All of us here are duty bound to take an especially responsible approach to investing in this area.

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the European educational programmes need only to be developed further rather than needing to be replaced by new ones is a point in their favour, especially in an age of globalisation and technological change. They have proved their worth in such a way, and have been so successful, that we only have to adapt them to the new structures. The structure of eLearning is the same as in the example we were given earlier, Erasmus Mundus. We are all familiar with the Comenius programme within the great Socrates programme framework, which is about cooperation between at least three schools from different Member States. This programme is extraordinarily successful, achieving a high degree of efficiency with relatively meagre resources and great commitment on the part of both teachers and students. So I think it is tremendous that we have managed to use the eLearning Programme to strengthen this area of technology-supported school partnership. We have, unfortunately, always had to decry the lack of sufficient funds for mobility for existing Comenius schools, and now, thanks to technology, mobility is being multiplied, albeit in the virtual realm. That cannot, and must not, become more than an additional area. Whilst it cannot be a substitute for real encounters between people, it can be an immense help to our schools in building up a real awareness of the Europe that we share. That is why I also enthusiastically welcome our desire to increase the estimate to 40%, and I would like to point out that, quite apart from bridging the digital divide, it is extraordinarily important not to lose sight of the need to develop European software. Of the software used in Europe, 80% originates in the USA. Whilst I am a friend of the Americans in bad times and good, I would like to see a more equal balance in the field of software, and so what I ask of the Council, not only as regards this programme, but also the other technological programmes, is that they keep an eye on the development and enhancement of European software and facilitate the support and promotion that this needs.

 Mr President, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, on behalf of my group and, I am sure, of the whole of this House's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I welcome the Commission's decision not to make any offer to deregulate educational, cultural and audiovisual services in this GATS round. Although we emphatically want borders to be opened up to international trade, there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between cultural services and others, such as those in telecommunications, transport, or, indeed, finance. This makes it necessary to anchor this special role played by cultural and audiovisual services in the social and political cohesion of peoples in the relevant laws on contract. Culture must not be made subject to the rules of the market or to commercial law; instead, we need regulation that takes into consideration what is appropriate to each area, and so we have to find a global solution to enable Article 151(4) of our European Treaties to be the means whereby Europe's, and the world's, cultural diversity is secured and supported in the long term and in a sustainable way. It is for this reason that we need a two-phase process in the future. The Commission is to be thanked for setting out the first phase in today's proposal that GATS should not cover the provision of cultural and audiovisual services. The second stage goes beyond that, and I want to say how grateful I am to Commissioner Reding, who, with this in mind, is representing the Commission's and Parliament's views – and, I hope, the Council's – in the international discussions and working parties on the subject. There is a need for us to devise our own international convention, an international instrument of our own, if the future of cultural diversity is to be secured. Excellent work has already been done in this area by the Council of Europe, Unesco and, especially, the Francophone Conference. I am quite sure that, by strengthening cultural diversity across the world in this way, we could effectively allay people's fears of globalisation, whilst at the same time enhancing and advancing worldwide intercultural dialogue – the need for which we are, in these times, more aware than ever.

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's core concerns include the safeguarding of freedom of information and the freedom and diversity of opinion. These are among our fundamental values, to which, it is to be hoped, the Convention will give a prominent place in the constitution that will be our common possession. That being so, Parliament has, over past years, repeatedly done in-depth work on these issues and taken actual developments in the European Union and the Member States as a yardstick when measuring the extent to which these things have become reality. I do not think one can say that Parliament has been asleep. It is not only 1997 that should be mentioned here; I would like to remind you all of what we decided together in 2000 with our position on the fundamental questions relating to the communication and information society in the European Union, and would also refer you to our common position on the revision of the television directive in 2001. That was something on which we did not yield. The only thing is that we have to take a realistic view of how things stand. So far, the results are clear and unambiguous: we have no option but to draw distinctions. The media markets continue largely to be the national markets that they were previously, as is unmistakeably clear in the case of the print media. Secondly, it is the case that in the electronic media field, the television markets are still predominantly national in character. It must, thirdly, be clear to us that development has progressed further. Cross-border developments are increasingly taking place in the electronic media, especially where digital technology is brought into play. This is a question on which we have to focus, examining very carefully what consequences this development is having for the safeguarding of freedom of opinion and information and pluralism of the media in the European Union and in its Member States. That is why my group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has put to you a question with reference to this specific development. We are asking the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the current situation to take up the question of the structural developments observable today in Europe's political, economic and legal media. We additionally ask you to table a proposal for our consideration on what you consider to be appropriate action in order to achieve the objective, which it is to be hoped is shared by us all, of safeguarding the pluralism of the media and of opinion in the European Union. I do think that, if we travel together in this direction, we will together take a significant step along the road towards guaranteeing diversity of opinion in the European Union. (Applause)

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed reply to the question put by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has been considering how we can find a way of guaranteeing a free flow of information and freedom of choice for viewers in the digital era. How can we achieve this objective? No further debate is needed, we held our debate when we passed a resolution on the telecommunications package and, more particularly, on the framework directive. Today, and this is why we asked the question, we wanted the Commission to tell us what it can do to help implement the resolutions we passed then. And I am grateful because I think the Commission's statements have pointed to a constructive way forward here. However, I should like to reiterate that we have three basic resolutions. First, open interfaces, so-called APIs are not enough; these open interfaces need to be widely accessible, i.e. they must be interoperable. That is the objective we decided on together in the framework directive. Secondly, we decided that the Member States should promote the introduction of interoperable technology. Thirdly, we decided that we had until July 2004 for this voluntary procedure. Parliament is pushing for action in order to bring about a voluntary, user-friendly solution which also guarantees real freedom of choice and pluralism. For that, as you announced today, Commissioner, we need the technology, the standards which meet these requirements, to be published. There is a standard which has already been licensed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is responsible for the standards, namely MHP, which is why Parliament's demand is perfectly clear in the resolution we are voting on today. What we want to do is promote the technology that incontrovertibly meets the requirements. Hence the demand and the call in the resolution for the Member States to submit an action plan as quickly as possible – we are saying by the end of this year – as to how this objective can be achieved, so that we have real results by July 2004. So, as you see – and my thanks here to all my honourable friends in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who helped here – we refer to the resolution and voluntary implementation of this resolution, but in the time specified and for the purpose specified. That is the point of this resolution. We trust that we have the agreement and support of the Commission and the Member States, in the interest of our citizens. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to Mr Vander Taelen for this report, but also for the commitment he has demonstrated in his Parliamentary work. He is a true advocate for European film. Even if he is lost to Parliament, he will be our gain as a partner among the experts. I think we will continue to work very well together. I am, though, also grateful to the Commission for the report it has submitted, which gives us the opportunity to draw up an interim balance sheet. After a good three years' work by Parliament and the Commission, where do we stand? In my view, this interim balance sheet shows one thing, namely that the European film industry is strong when we work together – Parliament, Commission, and Council, laborious though that sometimes is, with the professionals. The balance sheet for the past three years proves that we have achieved important things. Let me address just three of them. Firstly, the proportion of films other than of national European origin shown in European Union cinemas has increased by 21% over the past year. That means that our media programme has made a quite substantial contribution to achieving this important objective. Secondly, thanks to the initiative by Commissioner Reding and Parliament, the European Investment Bank has launched a fund to make available for audio-visual works urgently needed risk capital which totals EUR 400 million in this year alone. This is an important step in the right direction. Thirdly, the Commission has examined competition law with reference to the promotion of films by Member States and acknowledged that all of them do so in a legitimate way, so we have gained a good deal more security for European film. We cannot, however, rest on these laurels. This report highlights the most pressing problems that we have to deal with – and at EU level – over the coming years. We must also deal with them through initiatives on the part of the Member States. It is for that that I appeal to the Council, which insists on subsidiarity. I have listed only three points. We need to move over to qualified majority voting to have an efficient working basis under Article 151 of the Treaties. We need pilot projects for our digital heritage, and subsidy law needs to have proper provisions for the future of European film. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by offering my very special thanks to Mr Beazley for this report, because I think he has summed up Parliament's opinions in a particularly constructive way. You can tell that by the fact that we adopted this report unanimously in committee and that, today in Parliament, there are no amendments to this report left, and that on a topic that involves a very large number of problems and unanswered questions. So many thanks for it. The work we are going to do will be on a very good foundation. Our ongoing efforts will be particularly important because the future convergence of the media – television, computers, the Internet – will mean that we will have to find new ways to really guarantee that young people and human dignity will be protected. The proposals submitted by the Commission are therefore very much the right thing, and the Member States' support for them is urgently needed. I would like to again go over the three points that I see as being the most important. We need, firstly, new and more highly-developed models of self-regulation, enabling the industry and the responsible Governments to work together on a common basis. It is for this purpose that the model of jointly-coordinated self-regulation has been devised, and we need to develop it further. Secondly, it is not standards harmonised on a Europe-wide basis that we need, but Europe-wide minimum standards, particularly for video games and the Internet, in order to offer young people real protection. And, thirdly, media education is needed not only for children but also for their parents. All these tasks require involvement on the part of the Council, and it is to them, and for that, that I appeal.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Socrates, together with a number of other programmes, really is the European Union programme which builds Europe from the bottom up because, as Doris Pack has already told us, this programme allows generations of young people to experience Europe for themselves and gain a European perspective which stays with them for the rest of their personal and professional lives. That is why it is vital for Parliament to take the Council and Commission to task during these procedures and, of course, to make its own contribution. I should therefore like to address two points on which I would be grateful for the backing of other committees, especially the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control. The first point is the question of decentralisation. It has proven its worth, but the national agencies have a counterpart in Brussels; in future, this role will be filled by the executive agencies. We will need to work with these executive agencies as well as we have worked, thankfully, with the national agencies. So I urge the Commission and the Committee on Budgetary Control to create the conditions for such cooperation during consultations concerning these executive agencies. My second point is the question of financial control. We also need the support of the Committee on Budgetary Control if we really are to achieve the objective of awarding small sums in aid without incurring high administrative costs. The Commission should be given the necessary support here through Parliament in general and the Committee on Budgetary Control in particular. (Applause)

Madam President, during the previous debate on the European Socrates programme, we welcomed broad participation by our citizens, especially our young citizens, thereby bringing the European concept into the public eye throughout Europe. A great deal has been said about funding for and bureaucratic obstacles to the cultural agenda, but I should like to direct your attention to the question of the concept and, more importantly, to the question of what next? I am very grateful to Mr Graça Moura for conducting the discussion on the future concept for Culture 2000 so openly in his report and express my support to him for doing so. My question is, is it right, given that we have so little money, to promote big projects first and foremost. Surely we should also be prepared to integrate small networks, which can inject momentum, and exponential momentum at that, into the concept for the follow-up programme? That is what I am in favour of and I should like us to put proper funding in place and, at the same time, develop the programme so that there is less red tape and more opportunity for smaller groups to participate.

 Mr President, I would particularly like to join in thanking the Commission, the Council and all those Members involved. Thanks to their commitment, they have achieved considerable progress in the EU's telecommunications market. However, in contrast to what the word suggests, the term telecommunications market represents something that has not been dealt with properly, particularly in the Council common position we have before us. What I have in mind is digital television. I very much welcome the fact that not only the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose views I am conveying here, but also the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have unanimously indicated that it is simply not enough for us just to talk about attempting to avoid the danger of a digital divide in the European Union. I am not talking about access for people with disabilities, an area in which I think significant progress has been made. I am talking about the principle of digital access for all, and also about the interoperability of equipment, application interfaces and services. I very much I regret this, whilst praising the Belgian Presidency for everything else it has achieved, but this is the drawback of this outcome: the course is now being set for equal access via a common standard for digital television, and we naturally need to strike a balance between developing the market and public interest obligations, and these two points of view have been taken into account by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in their opinions. That is why I am urgently appealing to the Council, in view of this need to take cultural considerations into account, to ensure equal access for all. I call on you to improve this part of the text, and we will then all be able to give it our unqualified support. (Applause)
Hieronymi (PPE-DE

rapporteur
. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the Television without frontiers directive is to establish an EU legal framework to promote the free circulation of audio-visual broadcasting services and to guarantee certain particularly important interests, such as pluralism, cultural diversity, and the protection of consumers and minors. We have before us today the Commission's report on the application of the directive for the period 1997 to 2000. The key points to emerge from this report are as follows. The main objectives of the directive have been achieved, but a thoroughgoing revision of the directive is needed. The five main points of the report, very briefly, are these: firstly, the directive has been implemented in 12 Member States, with three yet to follow suit. Secondly, the television sector experienced an overall phase of continuous growth between 1997 and 2000. This applies both to the number of television channels and also to the total turnover of radio and television broadcasters and to the advertising turnover of both state-owned and private broadcasters. Nevertheless, the report indicates that when it comes to trade in television programmes, Europe has a deficit with the United States of some USD 2.9 billion, while the overall deficit of the audio-visual sector is some USD 6.6 billion. Thirdly, the 50% quota for European works was clearly exceeded, except in Portugal, falling in a range between 53% and 81%. Fourthly, although the provisions on the protection of minors were complied with overall, there needs to be better coordination in future. Fifthly, four countries have so far made use of the new provisions under Article 3a about broadcasting events of particular importance to the community, and four others are planning to take advantage of those provisions, particularly for sporting events. The committee noted shortcomings in the report with regard to implementation in the candidate countries and in the analysis of trends in media concentration. The digital era is now on the way, and the integration of television, PCs and the Internet requires a fundamental revision of the TWF directive so as to create a European legal framework for broadcasting audio-visual material with various degrees of regulation. The cornerstones of this should be as follows: first, the rules on advertising should be reviewed and made more flexible; second, the quota arrangements should be reviewed to see if they can continue to be a suitable instrument for promoting European works; third, we must guarantee open and compatible standards for various systems covering rights of access; fourth, there is a need for stronger and more effective self-regulation, particularly as regards the protection of minors; fifth, the trends in vertical and horizontal integration of the media should be analysed, and sixth, a review of the arrangements under Article 3a and how they are to be dealt within future is required. I can therefore give my full support to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 which have been tabled here. The preparations for this review process should take into account the exceptional impact of television and new technology on democracy and society, particularly in the digital era. The process of gauging public opinion therefore needs to be carried out openly, in a way that takes account of both experts in the audio-visual sector and the views of the public. So I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has provided for a broad communication process, and we hope, Commissioner, that in view of the speed with which digital technology is developing you will bring forward your proposed review as soon as possible. However, I would like to make an appeal to everyone: we must take advantage of the opportunities for dialogue over the next 18 months to demonstrate that the European Parliament cares about what matters to the public, especially when cultural issues are involved.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the content of these two reports, and also wish to thank the Commission for its initiatives to combat these appalling crimes: the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. It is right that we should think not only about how to define child pornography and sexual exploitation but also to what extent and where we set the age limits. It is also right that we should discuss the maximum penalties. I support the proposals put forward in the report. However, I should like to draw your attention to a further point – and I am grateful that it has been included in the reports – namely the problem of minimum, rather than just maximum, penalties. A society's condemnation of a crime is reflected to a substantial extent in the minimum penalties it applies. Even today, in many cases of child pornography crimes, the inadequate minimum penalties available mean that a suspended sentence is imposed. However, child pornography is certainly not a crime where a suspended sentence is appropriate. I therefore call for this House, through its cooperation on defining adequate minimum sentences, to create conditions which ensure that society genuinely recognises that these crimes are the worst form of harm that can be inflicted on a child. Together, through these initiatives, we should lay the foundation stones for this awareness within the European Union.

 Mr President, the World Trade Organisation is a tremendous economic success story. It has been such a success that our citizens are often rather alarmed by it, and suspect that it is rather sinister. So it is the task of the European Parliament, in particular, to instil confidence in the positive and sustainable nature of the WTO process. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, therefore, I greatly welcome the fact that Mr Schwaiger's report has again included safeguarding cultural diversity in the catalogue of demands. Our objective must be to explain to people, in credible, informed and comprehensible terms, that this process to which we are committed has the vision to achieve four goals on the basis of sustainable development: lasting economic growth for all, the protection of our environment, compliance with appropriate social standards and the preservation of cultural diversity. As the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, we should continue to promote this approach beyond the Union's borders as well. Mr Schwaiger's report provides a fresh and very sound basis on which to proceed.

Mr President, may I express my thanks for the strong support I have received from all the groups. This paved the way for a favourable decision on MEDIA by the Council. We have no need of conciliation procedure, and we are able to approve the common position today.

Mr President, I very much welcome this e-content programme and should like to refer to two aspects of it. First of all, digital technology reminds us that it is high time we dug up a treasure that lies buried within all of us and made use of it in this digital age. I refer to the cultural diversity of Europe, and we have the opportunity to safeguard it for future generations with the aid of new technology. Digital content demonstrates that Europe is not only an economic community; it is also bound by common values, and it is our desire and our duty to use this programme to preserve our common treasure for future generations in a highly competitive world. The programme therefore presents us with two opportunities: firstly it can help us to secure existing jobs and to create new ones, and secondly it offers us a unique opportunity to exploit to the full that cultural diversity which our language barriers have always prevented us from sharing and to ensure that it benefits everyone. Let me turn now to a second aspect of the programme. This programme relies to an unprecedented extent on public-private partnerships. In the cultural sphere, it is particularly important that we devise new forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors. That is why I am campaigning very vigorously for Parliament and its committees – the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport – to undertake a thorough analysis of the potential effects of this new form of cooperation between public and private funding bodies on the preservation of cultural diversity in Europe. May I conclude by thanking all those whose support has helped to ensure that the programme provides for the reallocation of funds in favour of linguistic and cultural measures. (Applause)

 Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Veltroni. As rapporteur, he has done some very good work, including work of a very cooperative nature, and I should like to thank him very much for that. However, thanks are similarly due to the Commission which has provided an outstanding basis for the discussions between the Committee and Parliament. The audiovisual sector basically faces the task of having to develop in two main fields. Firstly, it is a means of generating future jobs. Secondly, however, it is also of great significance for securing cultural diversity and freedom of speech in Europe. It is therefore important always to keep both perspectives in view. I should like briefly to illustrate this by way of three examples. Firstly, it is necessary to regulate content and methods of transmission differently and independently of each other. We need a form of technology which can respond very quickly and very flexibly to the technological revolution. I would just mention the buzz word ‘Internet’ at this point. However, we not only wish to guarantee people universal access to all networks but also need to ensure that young people are protected and human dignity assured by means of legal regulations which, independently of the method of transmission, safeguard these values that are indispensable to us all. Secondly, consider the level at which decisions are made. Where the issue of technology is concerned, we need increasing cooperation among the Member States at European level. When it comes to issues of content, however, we want to know that, in the first place, the Member States are willing and able to safeguard cultural pluralism and diversity of opinion. Thirdly, television in Europe. We have both commercial and public service broadcasting which both require clear statutory frameworks in order to be able to develop in competition. We therefore say a clear yes to the protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam on public service broadcasting and to the Member States’ responsibility for commissioning and for securing finance. We are also, however, saying just as clear a yes to the task of developing and promoting commercial television companies in Europe so that they can compete effectively worldwide. That is the crucial precondition for safeguarding European cultural content, with the conditions of future technology in mind.
Hieronymi (PPE-DE

rapporteur.

Mr President, I should like to begin by expressing my thanks to the Commission, to Commissioner Reding and to the members of all the relevant parliamentary committees for their wholehearted cooperation, and also to the Council under the Portuguese and now the French presidency for their cooperation during this stage of the legislative process. We all share a common commitment to the MEDIA programme and its twin aims of strengthening the European film industry and creating sustainable jobs through the audiovisual growth engine.  That is why it is important to realise that European companies have hitherto been totally underequipped with the audiovisual material that would have enabled them to keep pace with this development. The cross-border distribution of European films remains too limited. In the cinema industry, American films have cornered some 80% of the European market, while only 7% of the cinema films shown in the countries of Europe have been made in other European countries. About 74% of imported television feature films and series are from America, as against 14% from European countries.  Against this background the MEDIA programme, following on from its predecessors, MEDIA I and MEDIA II, is expressly designed to address this deficit in the circulation of European works and has three main support targets: the training of professionals in the audiovisual programme industry through MEDIA-Training and the development and marketing of audiovisual works through the MEDIA Plus programme. What is new about the present programme phase is that it takes account of the online dimension of all audiovisual production and that it has introduced pilot projects on the use of digital technology. To that extent, Commissioner, I can speak for all the participating committees and, I hope, for the whole House when I say that we support the proposals you have presented and hope that they all come to fruition.  I do wish to point out, however, that in some areas we have proposed amendments which we consider to be extremely important. The first of these, as so often, concerns the budget. The Commission is proposing EUR 400 million for a five-year programme in the audiovisual domain. Four hundred million was the budget proposed by the Commission back in 1995, and unfortunately the Council rejected that proposal. Whoever wants to grasp the opportunities offered by the digital revolution must be prepared to make the requisite investment. That is why the figure of 400 million is too low. The increase we are proposing is actually moderate; it would take the total budget to 550 million – 480 million for MEDIA Plus and 70 million for MEDIA- Training. This increase alone, however, will not bring spectacular success. We need two additional instruments. The first is linkage with other EU programmes, and the second is scope to inject venture capital into the private market; this is done as a matter of course in the United States, and we appeal to the Council and the Commission to work with us to ensure that it finally becomes reality in Europe too. The mobilisation of private capital is perhaps our key demand along with the pilot project relating to the European Investment Bank.  The second area is the question of the legal basis. We know that this is a difficult question for the Commission, but it is our wish that the audiovisual programme should be based not only on Article 157 of the EC Treaty, the article concerning industry, but also on Article 151, which is devoted to culture. This should also be made clear in the programme and be reflected in the legal basis. Finally, let me just list some other important requirements. The transparency and efficiency of the programmes should be promoted, funds should be concentrated on SMEs, independent producers and the Member States with limited audiovisual production capacities, and they should benefit the smaller linguistic areas. Finally, my appeal to the Council and Commission is this: work with Parliament, so that together we can create a resolute lobby for European films.   (Applause)

Mr President, I too would like to join previous speakers in extending sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen, for this report had to deal with two important subject areas, and has managed to strike an excellent balance between them. We need competition if we are to have any chance at all of creating the necessary conditions for the information society. At the same time, however, we want to afford EU citizens equal and secure access to these IT facilities. This report demonstrates this in the form of important points. I would like to touch on four of them.   Firstly, the report emphasises the need to separate regulation from infrastructure and content. This is absolutely essential if we are to secure not just a stronger market, but also greater diversity of information for citizens in the future.  Secondly, this report is in favour of using open standards and the common interface to secure access for all citizens to the information society and to enable them to participate in it from a technological point of view.   Thirdly, accordingly, it is both right and logical to use must carry rules to secure transmission opportunities for public service broadcasters under the terms of the content of their task.   Fourthly and finally, I would like to point out that what we need to do now is to analyse very carefully, on the basis of this report, what conclusions we should draw if we are to secure a broadly-based right to information for all citizens in the future. I hope there will be sound cooperation between the Commission and Parliament at the forthcoming discussions on the new directive, and also on the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive.

 Mr President, Commissioner, your comments this morning on both subjects showed that we need not only rapid data highways, but also efficient air transport in Europe to remain competitive. It is obvious that this will lead, in our densely populated States, to increasing noise pollution for citizens. I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly. I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport, an extremely densely populated region. We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens. Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport. The airports of Liège and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km. The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes, in particular. For this reason, I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives: a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for our citizens in the vicinity of airports. However, I have surmised, Commissioner, from the Commission’s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met. Firstly, it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and, secondly, there is still no common method for monitoring basic data. I therefore come to my request: you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report. You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment. You have announced a strategy, which I welcome, for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data. However, you have not set any deadline for this. My request to the Commission is that, together with the regions, you set deadlines, in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected, which we can all work towards in a team effort.

Mr President, Commissioner, e-Europe
 is a really important programme for everyone en route 
from the industrial society to the information society. I would therefore like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency on its decision to make this issue the focus of the special summit. I should like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal and the rapporteur on her report and I should like to explain why I have praised you and why I should like to take you all at your word. The focal point of the report and the prime objective of the Commission’s proposal make it clear that we need to achieve equal opportunities for, and equal participation of, all citizens in the information society. According to the text, e-Europe
 should, first and foremost, show each citizen, each household, each school, each company and each administration the way to the digital age and the Internet. This goal, in my view, does not justify the concerns raised here about a possible division in society between the haves and have-nots as far as access to information is concerned. I have highlighted this objective because I believe that it illustrates to particularly good effect how the citizens stand to benefit from European Union intervention in the information society, but, of course, only if we keep our word and fulfil the promises which we have made them. If we really do ensure by the end of 2002 that all schools – and this is in the programme – have high-speed access to the Internet and to multimedia resources in the classroom, if we really do ensure that by 2003 every citizen, rich or poor, has comprehensively guaranteed access to our health system and if we really do promptly take the action urgently needed in order to promote our SMEs, i.e. hedge the joint risks for venture capital in the Community. That is a task for the Council, Parliament and the Commission. I wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens. (Applause)

 Mr President, the results achieved by the Socrates programme are indeed impressive. In all, 500 000 students have spent time studying in another Member State as part of their course. 110 000 young people have taken part in exchanges. Overall, 1 500 universities and over 10 000 schools throughout the European Union have participated in this programme over the last four years. Parliament and the Commission wanted to build on this success for the years 2000 to 2007. The younger generation should have the opportunity not only to continue being involved in Europe but to become more involved. Above all though, young people in the applicant countries should have the opportunity to take part in the new programme on an equal footing from the very beginning. It is certainly hard to understand why the Council – which extended such a warm invitation a few days ago in Helsinki – denied the young people of Europe the funding which we considered necessary in the Conciliation Committee. That is why my particular thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and Commissioner Reding, who together with the Conciliation Committee have squeezed EUR 300 million out of the Council. I think that the Council can be sure that over the next few years the Commission and Parliament will continue to fight for young people in this way so as to obtain sufficient funds.

 Mr President, three brief remarks about the Millennium Round and cultural diversity. First of all, the EU is a success story, an economic community which has put its faith in open markets and given people security in the social sphere, together with economic prosperity. However, the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values. To uphold these values and to secure the cultural diversity of Europe are indispensable tasks at a time when the economies of the world are increasingly interrelated.  I should therefore particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in the way he has introduced the subject of securing the cultural heritage of Europe into the report for the Millennium Round. In the meantime, there are two goals. On the one hand, the dynamic development of electronic services ought not to be impeded. On the contrary, it must be facilitated for, like no other branch of industry, it guarantees jobs that are safe for the future, both in Europe and worldwide. On the other hand, we shall have to be in a position to support and promote the diversity of our European cultural heritage in the future too, and this by means of promotional measures taken also by the Member States.  The Schwaiger report facilitates both goals. It has therefore earned broad support from us all.

 Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is a key concept in European policy, and globalisation is making it more and more important. The unfortunate reality is, however, that we have found, and are still finding, that Europe’s citizens are not yet as mobile as we would like them to be. One of the main reasons for the fact that mobility has not yet been completely achieved is a lack of transparency of qualifications and competences. The lack of transparency, as we all know, is the most important obstacle to mobility in terms of training and professional activity and a significant block to making the labour market in Europe more flexible. The Commission has now submitted the proposal for a uniform framework concept for the promotion of transparency of qualifications and competences – in brief, the Europass – which has been long awaited and ardently desired. This Commission proposal is an exceptionally good one, in that it makes it easier for citizens to gain access to opportunities for mobility. The Commission has already said that in the new Europass portfolio five existing opportunities for mobility will be combined, namely the European career structure, the addition to the diploma, the existing Europass for professional training and references and, also extremely important, the European language portfolio. As already mentioned, these instruments already exist. However, they were not yet appropriately visible to the public. That makes it extremely important that not only the existing instruments, but also the networks, be coordinated and rationalised. An agreed portfolio of documents has a greater communication impact than a loose collection of separate documents. The important thing, however, is that it is an open portfolio, and I believe there are two reasons for this. In the first place, citizens can search for documents that are relevant to them. Nobody has to wade through all five documents. Secondly, this open system enables further documents to be included in the portfolio. I have proposed here in my report that the next document to be included in this portfolio should be a certificate of computer competence. At this stage, I would like to thank everyone, the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation, which has indeed ensured that this proposal can rapidly proceed through all the bureaucratic hurdles. I believe that we all have an interest in ensuring that this proposal is implemented as rapidly as possible and that the Europass is made available to the public as early as possible.

 Madam President, as we all know, Afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys. It is home to over 30 different ethnic groups, among them Pashtoons, Hasara and Tajiks, who co-exist in an equilibrium that has developed over history, but is very unstable. It is thus clear to us all that Afghanistan’s problems can be resolved only if proposed solutions and aid programmes are in harmony with Afghan culture and history. As the rapporteur said, the situation of women in Afghanistan is particularly tragic. The rate of maternal mortality is among the highest in the world; that is also the case for deaths of infants and children. According to official estimates the incidence of illiteracy among Afghan women stands at 90%. I believe that the position of women can be improved only if we involve the men. Women cannot be helped without persuading their husbands, fathers, brothers and their clan chiefs as well. If we want to help Afghan women, we have to respect their culture, and, in a country in which women have endured years of oppression, it is the men to whom it has to be explained that, if things are good for their wives and children, then they will be all right too and so society as a whole is better off. As has been said, women and men must be accorded the same rights. It is also important that we should build schools for girls – and for boys too – so that there can be some changes in the way they think. Reference has been made to the Afghan constitution, which accords equal rights to women and men, and which prohibits discrimination of any kind. As it gets involved, the European Union should continue to respect all this and allow its aid measures to benefit the population as a whole. I wish to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation on this issue and am behind both him and the Commission in their conviction that Afghanistan must continue to be a priority on our political agenda if the people who live there are to be helped. (Applause)

 Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the connection between women and sport has a long tradition in history, dating back to the first games in ancient Greece, it was only in 1928 that the decision was taken to allow women to participate in the Olympic Games. Women's participation in sport has steadily increased since then, even though it could and should develop more quickly today. This report focuses on women's participation in the three core areas of sport: sport in schools, sports for leisure, and competitive sport, although there are no proposals to create sporting opportunities exclusively for women in any of these areas. The principles of gender mainstreaming should apply in sport as elsewhere. Equality in sport is, in my view, the most important aspect of this report. The goal of equal opportunities for school, amateur and professional sport is above all a way of improving women’s integration at all these levels. On the other hand, the importance of women's role must be recognised in sport too. Women remain under-represented in sports administration and decision-making. Why is it mainly men who are involved in club and association structures, even though more and more women are becoming members? In top-level sport, this discrepancy is becoming increasingly apparent. Here, women are not represented in the decision-making bodies in a way that is commensurate with their achievements in professional sport. On the contrary, women are in a far more difficult position in top-level sport, especially as regards the health of women athletes. The Community must take action here, and it must do so in cooperation with the various organisations involved in competitive sport. It is also important, however, to consider the principle of subsidiarity. I share the view that it is unnecessary for the Commission to establish a ‘women and sport’ unit, as is proposed. There is also no budget line which could fund such a unit, and that is why I will reject Article 5 in tomorrow's vote. I would also ask you to reject Article 32, which proposes that when the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive is amended, it should stipulate that the Member States must broadcast women’s sport competitions. There is no Europe-wide mandatory list governing the broadcasting of sporting events. The individual Member States may, if they wish, draw up their own national lists of major sporting events which attract major public interest. In my view, establishing such an obligation would result in over-regulation, which is not something that we as a group want to see. That is why we will not vote in favour of Article 32 tomorrow. Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraisse very warmly on her excellent report. We too endorse most of the report, and we will vote in favour of it as a whole tomorrow.

 The reunification of Europe is an historic opportunity, and Czechs and Germans in particular have the prospect of a rich cultural heritage. I do not regard all the conditions for the Czech Republic's accession to the EU as having been met, my specific concern being the Beneš decrees, which have survived to the present day. Despite these misgivings, which for me are considerable, I have voted to approve the Czech Republic's accession. The young people of Europe share in but one common future – Europe! This is an opportunity that I do not want to deny to the young generation in the Czech Republic.

 Mr President, Commissioner, the number of students on the move is greater now than ever before, but the present situation is that the majority of international exchange students do not necessarily choose Europe as a place in which to study. I believe that one reason for this is that we have not yet entirely succeeded in combining the individual strengths, the diversity of the education we have to offer, and also our wide experience in networking. It is my opinion that this ‘Erasmus Mundus’ programme can help here. Promoting cooperation with third countries will also improve still further the quality of university education in Europe. What is also lacking, in my view, is a recognisable and clear-cut European identity for higher education. That is perhaps why many graduates and scientists prefer to do their research and studying in America. I think this attractive programme for high-quality education will do something to counteract this tendency. I would like, at this point, to extend sincere thanks to the Commission, and also to the rapporteur, Mrs De Sarnez, for this initiative. Mrs De Sarnez also deserves special thanks for having managed to negotiate an acceptable compromise with the Committee on Budgets, so that ‘Erasmus World’ is not funded to the detriment of already existing programmes. We have heard it said so often that young people's education, being an investment in the future, is no place for austerity measures. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, very briefly, to discuss the process by which the White Paper came into being and to enumerate a number of facts that illustrate why a White Paper on youth policy is absolutely necessary. We all know that 75 million of Europe's citizens – in which I include those of the enlarged Europe – are young people between the ages of 15 and 25, but the falling birth-rate and simultaneously rising life expectancy mean that our society is getting older. The proportion of the EU's overall population between the ages of 65 and 90 will rise from 16% to 21% between 2000 and 2020, whilst that of 14 to 24-year-olds will be as low as 11%. This disparity in numbers between young and older people will bring about considerable change to relationships at various levels. We need to find answers within our own society in order to meet these challenges. We too are called to take measures to accompany and support young people above all, in order to avoid social tensions and also adverse effects on our education systems and the labour market. After all, the present system of European cooperation on youth issues has been stretched to its fullest extent and can no longer cope with the problems that have to be tackled. We all know that investment in the young means investing in something that will make up the wealth of our society both today and in the future. As my lady predecessor on the floor said, youth policy falls mainly within the competence of the Member States. The new White Paper on youth policy is meant to point the way towards a new kind of European cooperation in the youth sphere. It is indeed the case that the White Paper is as yet far from ideal, but it does need to be implemented as a matter of urgency in order to increase young people's involvement in the integration of Europe and in shaping our future. The White Paper is a logical step for a forward-looking youth policy. I would like at this point to thank Commissioner Reding for her initiative in the past, but above all for her commitment and for the way she got to grips with the task of listening to young people and involving them directly. I see that as the right step on the right road, as youth policy, policy for young people, cannot be made without young people; it must be made with them. Even if the White Paper is not yet perfect, it is, as I have said, a step in the right direction. On behalf of my group, I ask you to support it when we vote tomorrow.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europeans travel across their continent without border controls, paying with the same money, and carrying passports of the same colour. That there is a European identity over and above all national differences has never been a matter of dispute. The wonderful thing is, though, that more and more Europeans are experiencing this in their daily lives. The European youth and education programmes, of which this Youth programme is one, have played a great part in this success. As the rapporteur has just said, it is one of the Community's most important support programmes, being the only one open to all young people without reference to their working or educational situation. We have already heard that over 10 000 projects, with over 100 000 participants, were financed in 2000 alone. We see this success as considerable, as we are talking here only about the first year of implementation. Good news like this should not, of course, have a detrimental effect on the Member States' national youth programmes, which could perhaps take the Youth programme's success as a pretext for cutting back on their own resources. I will therefore reiterate that the Youth programme was created in order to support and supplement the Member States' actions, rather than to discharge the Member States from their obligations. Quite on the contrary, the countries participating in the programme should make it easier for young people with an interest in the programme to take part in it, by reducing the administrative expenditure and, as the report was right to observe, granting the participants visas, where necessary, automatically and free of charge. One of this programme's important objectives is the greater involvement of disadvantaged young people, for whom, according to the Commission, 50% of the centrally-managed projects were intended. Short-term voluntary service, which was created especially for disadvantaged young people, has, however, not yet been made use of to a satisfactory extent, and the objective set of 20% of these resources was not attained. I see that, though, as appropriate. It is appropriate in terms of the programme's resources, rated at just about EUR 80 million, and of the relatively high administrative costs of EUR 12 million, and the Commission should succeed in achieving this objective. I take the view that such high administrative costs are defensible if new sources of participants are actually found and disadvantaged young people are brought into the programme to an appreciable degree. (Applause)

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between adolescents and alcohol is not a new problem. Alcohol is part and parcel of adult social life. It is therefore logical that adolescents will come into contact with alcohol as they approach adulthood. Children and adolescents are normally unaware of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption; born of curiosity to try new things, it can quickly become a habit. The average age at which children and adolescents try their first alcoholic drink has not fallen. Young people continue to have their first contact with alcohol in their early teens, as in the past. The age at which regular alcohol consumption begins, however, is falling steadily. Alcohol consumption by children and adolescents is an extremely emotive subject, since it concerns the rising generations of European citizens. The animated discussions in our committee left me in no doubt of the importance of this subject to every one of us. At this point I should like to thank all my fellow members for their contributions. We overwhelmingly took the view that responsibility in this area could not be assigned to parents alone; it was essential to create basic conditions in which adolescents could learn everything they needed to know in order to deal with exposure to alcohol. I should therefore like to re-emphasise that my opinion relates specifically to children and adolescents and their dealings with alcohol and not to the health implications of alcohol abuse in general. In February of this year, as the rapporteur said, a conference was held on the subject of young people and alcohol. One of the points that were made in the declaration adopted at that conference is crucially important, in my view, and I have taken it into account in my opinion. It is the fact that care must be taken to ensure greater involvement of young people in these programmes and measures. It is particularly important that support and assistance be given to schemes devised by young people for young people. Since children and adolescents are affected by the problem, they must be involved in the effort to resolve it. This is the only way to ensure that young people actually commit themselves to the cause. Prohibitions and regulations alone will not help young people to become responsible adults – quite the reverse. We can only achieve that if we let them learn to assume responsibility themselves. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in one month’s time, on the 9 May 2000, Parliament will be celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Robert Schumann’s declaration. In view of this historic event, we should focus our gaze on the fifty years that lie ahead for the European Community. When the next major anniversary is celebrated though, we will no longer be there to continue building our joint European edifice. This is something our descendants are going to have to do. Now is the time to take steps to smooth the way for them.  The new “Youth” action programme is the way to further European integration. Young people are Europe’s future. We should do everything we can to make sure that the young people of today feel completely at home in the European Community, better still that they develop close ties with it. Therefore it was, and still is, absolutely essential to create a programme that offers all young people – as Mrs Gröner has already said – irrespective of their origins, educational background, knowledge of languages, study or training, the opportunity to make contact with Europe.   This is a major innovation on the part of the Youth Programme i.e. that it is open to all young people, unlike the existing programmes, each of which covers a specific area. The new programme closes the gap, as it were, between the youth and educational programmes that are already running. Parliament, as well as the Commission and the Council, saw that there was a need for this programme, even if, as the rapporteur has just said, considerable hurdles had to be overcome in relation to the financial framework. We have the personal commitment of all the participating parliamentarians to thank for the fact that a compromise of EUR 520 million could be reached. I would like once again to take the opportunity to thank all those who haggled over every euro in the course of the conciliation procedure.   As Mrs Gröner said, even if the financial framework fell a long way short of our aspirations, still a large number of amendments were adopted. The new programme is more comprehensible and more citizen-friendly. The level of social protection for the participants has been improved. The programme has been heavily decentralised so as to enable young people in our home regions to take part in actions   Our Group endorses the programme, so as to spare young people having to wait any longer for their programme. (Applause)

 Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for her work. As a reminder, I should like again quite briefly to sketch out the new action programme in the youth field for the period 2000 to 2007. The action programme sets out to contribute to the realisation of a European sphere of education which promotes lifelong learning and facilitates the unrestricted exercise of citizens’ rights. By means of this action programme, the various programmes in the youth field which there have been so far ought to be brought together in concentrated form, as the rapporteur has just said.  Although the new action programme is to take the various programmes there have been so far and bring them together in concentrated form, no single programme is to be preferred. Parliament has already approached the Commission to see to it that the relationship of the one programme to another is well-balanced, thereby guaranteeing a better distribution of financial resources. In this way, the new action programme will, in some ways, be easier to take an overview of and also, therefore, more citizen-friendly than the numerous youth programmes that are all too scattered. A further advantage for citizens is the considerable decentralisation of the youth programme which therefore also enables young people to take part in the programmes in their home areas. I think this is very important because it also provides an opportunity for contact with Europe for young people in whom an interest in this area has not been inculcated at home. The earlier young people get together with people of other nationalities in Europe, the sooner they will take an active part in the integration of Europe.  The youth action programme also promotes the integration of Europe in a further sense by including the applicant countries in the East, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey. In this way, young people have the opportunity to become aware of the cultural diversity, not only of those States which are already members of the European Community, but also of those which are still on the borders of this Community but large groups of whose populations already live in various Member States. This state of affairs in turn has a positive effect upon the struggle for the respect of human rights and against racism, exaggerated nationalism and anti-Semitism. In this way, young people actively contribute to the construction and integration of Europe. By contributing to programmes with participants from various Member States, young people discover the real Europe in its social and cultural diversity and become alert to new surroundings, something which greatly increases the incentive to learn a foreign language. For a programme of seven years’ duration, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport requires an overall financial package of EUR 980 million. However, the Council is only prepared to approve exactly half of the amount we requested. I believe that I do not have to repeat yet again here that this sum is in fact spread over seven years, meaning an annual amount of EUR 140 million. As Mrs Gröner has already quite rightly said, this money is not being invested just anywhere but in the future of Europe, a future which lies with the youth of Europe.  The education of European youth is not an area in which money-saving measures are to be taken. It is therefore important that Parliament should agree to the programme with a large majority so that we can enter into negotiations with the Council with definite backing.  (Applause

 Madam President, Commissioner, the own-initiative report before us by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs relates to the Commission communication on a framework for promoting employee financial participation, in other words, employee participation in profits and productive capital. The communication is intended to kick-start studies and research projects on the opportunities and risks involved in a policy of a broad distribution of assets. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs welcomes the setting up of a working group of independent experts to present proposals to overcome the various problems relating to employee participation. The focus in this context is on transnational obstacles in enterprises operating across national borders concerning different levels of taxation for participants. A detail: my report proposes that, in the case of share options, tax should only be payable when the shares acquired by way of option conversion are successfully sold. This would make sense especially if employees, and not only top-level management, are to be given stock purchase rights. The primary concern of the Commission communication is to strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy in accordance with the Lisbon strategy decisions. The Commission proposed a productivity-related wage policy as far back as the Delors White Paper on Employment. Restraint in terms of cash wage increases, it suggested, would lead to higher profits and thus to investment, in other words to the creation of jobs. The opinion of our committee is that it is not enough to say thank you to employees for their modesty and understanding; instead, on the basis of voluntary schemes, they should have a share in the profits and investments that would not have been possible without their restraint. We support and complement the general principles developed by the Commission: first of all, schemes must be voluntary, in other words, both employers and employees must agree to them. Second, all employees must be included in the participation scheme. This means that part-time employees – often women – must not be excluded, in other words, there must be no discrimination against women. Wherever possible, unreasonable risks should be avoided, especially in the case of employees of small and medium-sized enterprises. They face a double risk in the event of insolvency, namely that they could lose both their job and the value of their shares. The Commission has clearly set out its proposals for profit and equity participation in larger enterprises in particular, especially in public limited companies. Here, we could learn from the experience of other countries, especially countries that are models of participatory schemes, such as Britain and France. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs recommends that more consideration should be given to the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, and that participatory schemes which are also feasible for small and medium enterprises should be promoted at national level. The Committees on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on Economic and Monetary Affairs and on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have given important answers to the many questions relating to profit and equity participation. They have presented their opinions very well, and I thank them for this. Special thanks also goes to the Commission for its valuable suggestions. The consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were very constructive, for which, thanks once again to all the parliamentary groups and to all the shadow rapporteurs. Here, to conclude, is the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on one or two burning issues: first, because employees with equity participation are more motivated, an increase in productivity is likely. This leads to lower unit costs, which increases the volume of sales, with the resulting possibility of creating more jobs. The broad spread of ownership also increases willingness to invest, because fairer distribution of wealth stabilises the structure of society. Second: we need an enterprise law that coordinates co-ownership and cooperation. The new enterprise law must ensure that employees are no longer outsiders, but members of the enterprise. In ‘Quadragesimos Annos’ this is formulated as follows: the work-contract should be developed to become a partnership-contract. Through ownership and participation, employees become co-workers and co-workers become sharers in ownership and management. The goal is to make employees economic citizens with equal rights. Let us embark on the path towards this goal. It is in this spirit that I call upon you to approve the present report. (Applause)

 Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations to Mr Schmid on a very good report on the Commission communication “Strengthening the local dimension of the European Employment Strategy”. Having been the rapporteur on Parliament's guidelines on employment policy in 2000, I take pleasure in referring to what we in the plenary decided almost unanimously at the end of 1999. We decided that "the special role and responsibility of local and regional authorities, other partners at the regional and local levels, as well as the social partners, needs to be more fully recognised and supported. In addition, the role of the Public Employment Services in identifying local employment opportunities and improving the functioning of local labour markets, should be fully exploited." The call for Territorial Employment Pacts, sometimes couched in rather nebulous terms in the Commission document, is supplemented in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by the demand for the creation of employment pacts between the social partners in enterprises. I was recently convinced by an example in my constituency of how successfully an attempt of this sort can work. The Bürkert works in Ingelfingen were saved by this. There is a need for a binding guarantee of employment to be agreed in return for workers waiving their rights to certain benefits. This will be significantly improved by the incorporation of the local dimension into the European employment strategy. What this is about is European coordination of national employment policies while incorporating also their local counterparts, the objective being a joint strategy to tap society's potential for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. This is about subsidiary solutions that harmonise flexibility and social security. The right formula for the European employment strategy is “think globally, act locally” and it is with that in mind that we want to support Mr Schmid's report.

Mr President, let me start by welcoming, on behalf of my group, the compromise achieved in the Conciliation Committee on the framework directive on information and consultation. I would like at the same time to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, for leading us to that compromise, which is now very close to the common position. We have had quite vigorous discussions in our group on information and consultation, but we agreed that the common position is a really good starting point for a sensible solution. Starting with first reading in April 1999, and, indeed, in the committee meetings before that, there were often major differences of opinion between the groups; the rapporteur had to be agile – she was too – and the same was true for me as shadow rapporteur for the largest group, the PPE-DE. We have a constructive compromise before us. What was possible has now been done. What mattered was at last to get a foot in the door, which can then be opened a bit wider by the next blast of wind. Second reading stage saw the PPE-DE prevail on many points. The majority in my group were opposed to European sanctions but in favour of national ones. The conciliation process saw these ideas incorporated in the recitals. In its final form, the framework directive primarily contributes to the functioning of the European Works Council. All local workers' representatives are given minimum rights helping them to assess the information received from the European Works Council. Secondly, it helps mitigate problems with restructuring, which affect national enterprises as well. The Works Councils directive, on the other hand, applies only to multi-national enterprises. The framework directive prescribes that the procedure be carried out in a spirit of cooperation. This means partnership, which, on the one hand, aims at the clear representation of interests, but also, on the other, their equalisation by means of information and consultation in shared dialogue. Information at the right time results in transparency, which itself builds trust and avoids the enterprises sustaining frictional losses – an economic and social gain. Both employers and workers gain from this, and do so in the same way.

Mr President, the Lisbon European Council and the socio-political agenda adopted by the European Council at Nice bring us into a new phase of policy on social affairs and employment in the European Union. As we have heard from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the President of the Commission, interest is now focussed on the quality of work and of social affairs policy. We in this Parliament want to be fully involved in this development. We – by which I mean the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whose Chairman, Michel Rocard, I represent – are therefore putting an oral question to the Council and Commission, coupled with a motion for a resolution. It is our conviction that secure jobs, favourable working conditions and appropriate workers' rights do not diminish productivity and economic growth and hence the creation of jobs, but, on the contrary, promote them. Work for all is the objective. We want a strategy for more and better jobs. Quality of work involves job satisfaction, which improves employees' motivation, and health and safety at work improve as well. We are looking to the Commission to produce a proposal on the status of temporary workers. Moreover, quality of work involves equal treatment of both sexes, the reconciliation of work and family life, and measures to keep older people in the job market. For this we need the most modern forms of vocational education. There is a need for further education, in-service training and lifelong learning. The adaptability of enterprises and their capacity to deal with structural change will be particularly important in creating new and better jobs, and minimum standards across Europe are needed to ensure that employees are involved in this, informed and consulted in due time, and thereby enabled to adjust to change. In comparison with our economic counterparts, for example, the United States, Europe suffers from a low employment rate. The Lisbon European Council recognised that this was a problem and proposed an ambitious objective for progressively increasing this rate. It is absolutely vital that we achieve this objective. The Commission has presented a communication in preparation for the Laeken Summit, in which it sets down the outlines of a strategy for promoting quality of work and social affairs policy. The drawing-up of appropriate indicators and criteria, as Mr Prodi informed us, is not the least important of these, but is primary. As I said at the outset, Parliament expects to be fully involved in discussions. It is our ever more frequent experience that European social affairs policy is carried on by dialogue between sub-committees of the Council – for example the Employment Committee or the Social Protection Committee – and the Commission. Parliament is often left out in the cold. We protest against this. Parliament must be able to play its rightful part in formulating proposals on subjects such as employment and social protection which, after all, are of immediate concern to all citizens. If we are to do this, the relevant specialised fora and the Commission have to keep us up to date with the work they are doing, and Parliament has to be consulted in good time before every European Council. We expect a clear pledge on this from the Laeken summit. We are, at the end of the day, the representatives of the people and therefore, in essence, the primary organ of the European Union. President Prodi just used a very fine expression in describing Parliament as the most important expression of democratic Europe. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, it is for these reasons that we look forward to your answers to our oral questions.

 Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, firstly because she showed a great deal of flexibility in meetings of the Committee, including taking on board a series of proposals by the European People's Party, and secondly because this has meant that her very good report on the Common Position on the framework directive for minimum standards in national employee information and consultation points in the right direction. As with the directive on European works councils, the issue is not codetermination, but information and consultation on important economic, financial and employment policy developments in business. Restructuring cannot and should not be hindered, but it must no longer take place in the form of a commando raid, as so often happens – witness Renault's shock at Vilvoorde – but only following prior notification of the employees concerned. There are, though, many parallels with the works councils directive in other respects. The regulations on European works councils apply only to mergers of businesses across national boundaries, but restructuring often takes place at a national level. The European People's Party favours flexibility. For example, management and labour in a business can, through agreements, arrive at a special made-to-measure arrangement on information and consultation for that business. That is subsidiarity. The Common Position says rightly that agreements should be able to be more, or even less, favourable than the minimum standard. Yet, the rights of local works councils may not be jeopardised under national law. Article 1 prescribes that the procedure should be carried on in a spirit of cooperation. This means partnership. Partnership aims on the one hand at the clear representation of interests, and on the other hand at their conciliation in shared dialogue through information and consultation. There is no doubt that this is economically advantageous. Inadequate information results in insecurity, mistrust, and finally only fear, ending in blockade. Timely information means transparency that creates trust and avoids businesses making friction losses. Both workers and employers are winners, and in the same way. (Applause)

 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mayer pointed out that the idea of creating a European limited liability company was already being discussed more than 30 years ago. The former President of the European Commission and Member of this Parliament, Mr Santer, made this form of company a more prominent subject for discussion in the second half of the 1990s. Mr Santer and a number of his fellow campaigners here in Parliament wanted it as a way of attracting global players from Europe to compete in world markets. The European limited liability company has hitherto foundered in the Council of Ministers especially because of the issues surrounding the position of workers. In 1970, a regulation on the European limited liability company one-sidedly stipulated just the German model of co-decision-making, although co-decision-making is simply not an item for export. In the late 1980s, Parliament was presented with two documents which were intrinsically linked. Dr. Mayer has already outlined these: a regulation on issues of company law – the statute – and the directive concerning the position of workers in the limited liability company or SE. Three models were established, of which one had to be chosen. Even in this matter, there was no general consensus. It was only in 1997 that a solution emerged in the form of a proposal from Parliament. This proposal was underpinned academically by the work of a group of experts under the chairmanship of Etienne Davignon, and the Davignon Report was signed by trade union members and members of employer associations. Whichever way you look at it, this was a breakthrough because it fell back on the recipe for success established by the Directive on the European works council, a subject which we shall touch upon again in the next item on the agenda. The following basic principles for the creation of a European limited liability company were now proposed: flexibility, negotiated solutions and minimum standards. Thus, the customs of employee participation existing within the European Union were also skilfully incorporated. In other words, in some countries participation is established through legal channels and in others by means of collective agreements. Now these are combined: as regards the European limited liability company, a special made-to-measure collective agreement is drawn up between the founding board of directors and a special negotiating body of employees and, in the absence of an agreement, the minimum laws governing worker involvement shall be applicable for half a year to a year. The Davignon Report calls these reference rules. The EWC Directive talks of subsidiary requirements. I think this is the better term as it refers to subsidiarity in an exemplary manner. This idea was also decided upon in Nice. We support the regulations governing participation agreed in Nice. The report from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposes two significant amendments to the Council’s draft. Firstly, we would like a different definition of the term participation from that used by the Council. The designated body representing workers is nothing more than a special European works council for the European limited liability company, incidentally with better legal powers, something which we should remember when amending the Works Council Directive. However, there are, and remain, laws governing information and consultation. It would be wrong to use the term ‘participation’ here. Secondly, the original Commission proposal made it clear that the procedure for electing employees onto the supervisory or management board is to be governed according to the provisions applicable in each Member State. In Germany, therefore, employee members must be directly or indirectly elected in accordance with the election of members to supervisory boards pursuant to the German law on stock companies. I am convinced that, in this regard, it is essential not to make a distinction in the electoral process. Under German law on stock companies, members are elected. Under the arrangements governing the European limited liability company, employee representatives will not be elected. The regulation and directive in question have retrieved the European limited liability company from the frozen depths of European legislation. However, both – and here I agree with Mr Mayer – exhibit major shortcomings. We must finally take the first step, however. After six years, these two legal instruments should be tested and, if necessary, improved. We must get a foot in the door. The next gust of wind will open that door. I think that, with this European model, we are on the right track, including where the social dimension of the internal market is concerned. The European model is, of course, not purely a matter of market economics and, therefore, not purely a limited liability company either. Rather, it is a limited liability company also involving the participation specifically of the employees.

 Mr President, in September 1994 the Council adopted the Directive on the establishment of a European works council. The transposition of this Directive is the subject of a Commission report. The report submitted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopts a position on this Commission report. In terms of sheer numbers, we can already talk about the European works council as a success story. When the Directive was adopted by Parliament and the Council in 1994, there were approximately 30 voluntary agreements governing information and consultation in respect of the work forces of companies and groups of companies throughout Europe. In the meantime, this number has risen to above 650. The Commission report demonstrates that the Directive on the European works council was the main driving force behind this development. In establishing European works councils, the solutions, more or less made to measure and reached at company level between the management and the special employee negotiating body, are granted priority. As with the European limited liability company, here too the formula of flexibility, negotiations and minimum standards – applicable if negotiations have not reached a successful conclusion – applies. These are referred to as subsidiary requirements in the EWC Directive. The shocking events at Renault Vilvoorde in Brussels demonstrated for the first time that the aim of the European works councils had not always been achieved, whereby the relocation of production should not be effected in the form of a commando raid but only after the employees concerned have been informed and consulted in good time. However, every light has its shadow. The directive has its weak points, and the Committee for Social Affairs is pressing for a revision. We did not say that this should have been undertaken as early as 1999 or 2000. In the discussion of the social agenda, the Commission specified the year 2002. Our motion for a resolution is intended to form the basis for discussion with a view to the amendment of the EWC Directive. In a range of discussions, hearings and symposia, I have heard the complaint that, in some serious cases – especially in the case of emergency consultation – information and consultation have not been taking place in good time. Therefore, the proposed improvements, which aim to ensure that information and consultation take place in good time, remain the main focus of the report, the object being that advice from the European works council is listened to, and can also be taken into account, prior to decisions by the management. The report is in favour of an enhanced consultation procedure with a view to reaching agreement. Today I would like to add the words: with a view to reaching agreement ‘on the further procedure’. I am not saying that it shall be compulsory to reach agreement, though, as previously in the Committee meetings, I reject the right of veto of the European works council in accordance with Amendment No 5, which was submitted today. My report contains the more elegant solution, proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, to hold, if necessary, a second round of meetings, as is also provided for by the Directive on the European limited liability company. A broader right to information and consultation on the part of the European works council shall not affect an important stipulation of the directive, formulated in recital K of the present report at the request of Mr Bushill-Matthews. The management’s right to communicate directly with the workforce remains as unaffected as its right to manage the company. Partnership and subsidiarity must also, according to the amendment, determine the contents of the EWC Directive. There are principles of Christian social doctrine which, of course, has supporters in different parties. Based on the initiative of the European Parliament, the legislative text of 1994 established an EWC Directive calling for the spirit of cooperation. Partnership is not a soporific measure. Partnership is intended to provide a clear representation of interests, and also a balancing of the interests of employee and employer by means of information and consultation, which is also advantageous from an economic point of view. The failure to provide information results in uncertainty, distrust and finally anxiety, which leads to blockades. Providing information in good time is a sign of transparency, which breeds trust… (The President cut the speaker off)

 Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission on behalf of the PPE-DE for its explanation and also for telling us that the framework directive will soon be ready, as will the Statute for European Companies. However, I should like first and foremost to refer to the European works council project, which our group has fully supported. I think the Commission is right to criticise how companies are behaving at present. The Commission report on European works councils, which we are currently debating in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – we have held a hearing on the subject – is most interesting. It proves that works councils have, as a rule, fulfilled their duties. We found out, interestingly, that restructuring, which may be necessary on occasions, can be implemented more efficiently if employees are informed and involved. In countries with more codetermination, such as Germany, there are fewer disputes and hardly any strikes in connection with structural changes to the economy. The spirit of cooperation and partnership which Parliament brought to bear at numerous points of the directive is such that closures and relocations cannot take place in the form of commando attacks but must be preceded by timely and comprehensive information for and consultation with the workers. This is often not the case. Ensuring there is timely information and consultation, before company decisions are taken, is a very important aspect and must be taken into account when the directive is revised. I hope that the Commission will introduce an initiative this year which at least ensures that the social partners are informed and involved. I agree with you, Commissioner, that the current rules must be tightened. It is not enough for sanctions to be imposed solely at national level; we also need measures at European level. As you rightly stressed, we need the framework directive, because in numerous cases restructuring takes place solely at national, rather than at transnational level. The directives on mass redundancies and safeguarding employee rights during takeovers also belong here. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if there are any plans to revise these two directives as well? I think that the Europe of the future is also a Europe of the workers. Information, consultation and codetermination rights are in keeping with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Mr President, Mr Cercas Alonso has drafted a quite excellent report. As we have seen, this is an issue which we are all itching to get our hands on: safe and sustainable pensions, a truly hot potato which gets hotter rather than cooler the longer we leave it. That is why both the Member States and the European Union need to act here. We need a satisfactory pension system, which is why the reference to the 1992 recommendation is, I think, particularly important. But we also need a flexible pension system which has one eye on social change and the need to adjust to the job market. The idea of an active old age has, basically, been accepted. You only have to think of the employment policy guidelines for 2000, i.e. maintaining employability and lifelong learning. I should also like to mention the contribution by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to the report. It refers to the numerous women on widow's pensions with no source of income of their own. We must reverse the trend whereby these widows' pensions are being whittled away. This is one very important matter addressed in the report. As far as the future is concerned, the concept of open coordination is on the table. We must also ensure that this has real meaning as far as pensions are concerned. We should not simply use it as an open sesame; we have to understand that the employment policy guidelines cannot simply be applied line by line. On the contrary, we need new forms of coordination and these need to be created. For the rest, I really do welcome the fact that the second and third pillars are dealt with as well as the first. I would also mention the idea of capital formation by employees. We must ensure that capital formation and old-age pensions complement rather than contradict each other. (Applause)

 Mr President, at the Lisbon Summit full employment was defined as the overriding objective of EU policy. I approve Mr Bullmann’s report, which was based on the employment guidelines first formulated in 1997 at the Employment Conference in Luxembourg. I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. He is correct when he says that, in the future, more qualitative indicators need to be established which, for instance, take account of the variety of jobs and the minimum consultation rights of workers in their organisation, or environmentally-friendly technologies. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to call for this method of combating youth unemployment. The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Cocilovo, expressed this excellently. Economic realism is necessary in all the targets we set ourselves within the framework of employment policy. As the European People’s Party, we will not be pursuing any pipe dreams. The transformation of our society into a service and knowledge-based society is making great strides forward. That is why all our demands are targeted at life-long learning and at restructuring the education systems along the right lines. We often raise our employment plans in official addresses; they feature in many papers, in European directives, in national action plans, where they are wonderfully expressed. But paper is patient. What matters now is that these plans are put into practice. As its contribution to achieving the goal of implementing the proposals that have been made, the European People’s Party will assess the Spring Summit. We do not need a literature Summit. I am convinced that Stockholm will not be a literature Summit, as action, not proclamations, is now called for!

 Mr President, Commissioner, greater generosity of cover for individuals and rising costs in the Member States' health sector are creating two requirements. First, the need for individuals to pay more from their own pockets towards statutory schemes or through private supplementary health insurance, and secondly greater coordination of such private health insurance in the European Union. My sincere congratulations go to the rapporteur, Michel Rocard. His diagnosis is first-rate, but there are a couple of question marks hanging over the treatment he prescribes. I need to distinguish here between his practical requests and the key points of the approach he suggests to solve the problems here. These are based on important principles, namely solidarity, subsidiarity and minimum standards, and we fully accept those. As Mr Pronk indicated, we oppose the idea of imposing a directive immediately. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' new proposal is correct, suggesting as it does that there should first be a review of the situation in the form of a Green Paper and that only then should decisions be made about whether a directive or recommendation is needed. As regards the heterogeneous nature of the systems already in existence, there are Member States in which individuals have to find a substantial proportion themselves, for example 40% of the cost of outpatient treatment. In these cases supplementary schemes are more significant than in Germany, for example, where 90% of the population are covered by statutory health insurance which up to now has been obliged to guarantee necessary medical treatment for all. We in Europe should be pointing the way forward without delay, with a socially acceptable level of self-provision combined with the maintenance of existing standards, if necessary by means of permanent supplementary health insurance. But people will need time to build up a suitable level of provision. That is the alternative to the manipulation and trickery of insurance systems that comes with statutory schemes.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Skinner for his commendable report on this complex issue of health and safety requirements for the use of work equipment, and also for being willing to adopt important proposals put forward by the PPE-DE Group. Mr Perez Alvarez has already gone into this. I am not happy on every count. A certain amount of amendment will be necessary prior to the second reading, but the PPE-DE Group is prepared to accept the report overall. The report in its present form even takes account of objections raised by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and calls for experts to be involved, but, of course, only where the setting up of ladders and scaffolding equipment at the workplace is concerned. As is surely the case with all legal texts at national – and at regional level for that matter – some of the phraseology might raise a smile, if you can call any of it a laughing matter that is. The smile certainly drained from my face when I read the European-wide statistics on accidents in the workplace, and on hearing them just now. I do not intend to go further into the facts and figures, as we have already heard a great deal on that score. But there is one fundamental point I would like to make. Safety measures are not the only things that cost. Continued payment of wages, sick pay, invalidity, widows’ and orphans’ allowances are a drain on business and on the national economy. This is how productive a moderate social policy is. Preventive action is also better, cheaper and more humane than a social policy that deals with the consequences. It is no good shutting the stable door when the horse has bolted; you need to make sure it is shut to start with. ‘But what about subsidiarity?’, goes the common cry. This principle is not meant to render Europe completely inert! I like the definition provided in Quadragesimo anno
 the best: subsidiarity – gives right of way in cases of doubt to smaller living entities and to solutions reached by social partners, in the face of State, or – I might well add – EU rulings. But if the smaller entity is unable to perform its tasks in the interests of the public good, then the larger entity must step in. This explains why so many European minimum standards were laid down in the EU Treaties in the eighties, when Christian Democrats and Conservatives had the monopoly on power in Europe; in other words, it is a Christian Democrat affair. Incidentally, health and safety regulations have been organised at international level since the industrial revolution in the 19th century. The great Conservative British statesman Benjamin Disraeli was one of the pioneers of health and safety regulations. Continental Europe took its cue from England, adopted these laws and also enshrined them in international conventions, doing so from the very outset. In view of globalisation and Europeanisation, there is without doubt a need for the European social dimension in the 21st century. We want to Europeanise the economy. We have the single currency. It cannot be the answer to deal with social policy at a purely regional, or even provincial, level. Minimum standards mean subsidiarity. Each country can frame its own health and safety regulations provided that European minimum standards are observed. We PPE-DE Group Members are opposed to European maximum standards. In Germany the picture is completed by legal acts introduced by the social partners. There are German standards and health and safety regulations for the workplace. We also have statutes such as legal acts governing professional trade associations, not to mention the accident prevention law. Incidentally, it is all very well for people to be critical – for stylistic reasons among others – of the fact that we have a whole host of detailed regulations. I tell you this though; a fraction of these practical regulations would do the citizens and workers of the Member States a greater service than reams and reams of fancy talk and great ideologies.

Mr President, the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs makes it clear that the pay-as-you-go based, statutory pensions schemes in the Member States need to be supplemented by capital-backed company or other supplementary pensions schemes. Mr Kuckelkorn has provided an excellent analysis of the situation and is to be congratulated.   There are differences of opinion between and within the groups. It is both possible and necessary for there to be compromises. Why should we not include schemes with and without biometric risk coverage in one directive, but treat them differently? It would be possible to favour cross-border pension funds or similar schemes, which cover many of the aforementioned risks, for example by having minimum regulations governing tax law.   Quite often, a reduction in contributions is taken account of with statutory pensions schemes in the Member States, as in Germany, with any shortfall to be made up by supplementary company schemes. Naturally the statutory system makes provision for widows and invalidity pensions, for example. We therefore need appropriate regulations for supplementary schemes, otherwise the collective agreement we need will simply not be feasible.  A second moot point is that of codetermination. I am in favour of compromising with “cooperation” rather than introducing the frequently obstructive concept of “codetermination”. Minimum codetermination rights for the beneficiaries are what we need to aim for, at least in the case of closed systems such as company pension funds, for example through an investment committee which establishes the principles of investment policy. We need, as a matter of urgency, to set the course for the future. It is becoming increasingly important for people to make their own supplementary provisions for old age, in order to safeguard their standard of living. People need time to make these provisions. That is the alternative to manipulating and fiddling statutory pension schemes.   (Applause)

 Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, the Portuguese Presidency has presented an ambitious programme for the Special Summit. Congratulations! I also welcome the support which Portugal is receiving from the Commission, not least through the communication which seeks to develop the Community into an information society for everyone. The comment made by the Christian Democrat Prime Minister, Jean Claude Juncker, at the employment summit in Luxembourg in 1997 also applies to the Lisbon Summit. He said that it must not be a literary convention, referring to the numerous non-binding declarations made at many summits. In adopting the Luxembourg Process the Heads of State and Government achieved tangible successes. Since 1997, however, the really significant results have failed to materialise. So far, the Cologne Employment Pact has not been able to be invested with sufficient content. In addition, the macroeconomic dialogue lacks the participation of the European Parliament as an equal partner. Yes, some aspects of the Luxembourg employment policy guidelines have not been applied rigorously enough by the Member States, in particular, for example, in the field of lifelong learning, as the 1999 Joint Employment Report noted. In information technology, in particular, some European countries lack qualified workers, as Mr Suominen emphasised. Rather than ‘importing’ them from third countries, it is better to invest accordingly in vocational training and further education, to invest in human capital. This is the most effective way of reducing unemployment. The most important objective of the Summit must be achieved as quickly as possible, and that is to improve the competitiveness of the European economy. In this context the Ciampi Group also mentions the European company statute. It puts the loss to the economy of not having a statute of this kind at EUR 30 billion a year. We do not want the basic unrefined European company model. We need this European company to come supplied with minimum standards of worker participation. Our social policy goal is not of course the basic unrefined model of the market economy either, but a social market economy built on the European model. We should also judge the success of the Lisbon Summit on the contribution it makes to achieving this goal.
Menrad (PPE-DE

Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have indeed developed an ambitious programme of work. We in the PPE have great hopes for the planned summit on employment. What the Christian Democrat Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Juncker called for in the run-up to the employment summit in 1997 also applies to the planned special summit in Lisbon. It must not be a literature summit, whereby Juncker was referring to the endless non-binding declarations made by numerous summits. On the contrary, the heads of government achieved a quite specific result under the Luxembourg process, i.e. coordination between employment policy guidelines and national action plans. However, really important successes have failed to materialise since 1997. Above all, there are shortcomings in the practical implementation of the guidelines. The 1999 joint employment report cites a lack of activity by Member States in reforming the tax and social benefit systems and in participation in lifelong learning, together with shortcomings in promoting social partnership to modernise the way in which work is organised. Employment policy has been extremely important to Parliament for many years. Unfortunately, again in 1999, the Council and the heads of government adopted hardly any of our proposals, for example on the so-called European employment package from Cologne or on the Guidelines 2000. I would ask the Portuguese Presidency, as it has announced in its discussion paper: please do better, please take greater account of our positions. New economic impetus, competition and flexibility need to be brought into line with vital demands for social security. The success principle behind the social market economy is the model of the future for Europe.

Mr President, hardworking Finnish diplomacy has also endeavoured over the last six months to make progress on the employment and social side of the Community. The creation of an Employment Committee increases the potential for Member States to improve coordination between their policies in this area. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the fact that the presidency has prepared proper employment guidelines for 2000 at various councils of ministers and ministerial conferences. Nonetheless, several national governments and the Council have not come fully on board. As a result, only a small proportion of Parliament’s proposals on the guidelines was adopted in Helsinki. Parliament wanted to achieve more in the fight against unemployment among the young and long-term unemployment than the Council was proposing; above all, we wanted to achieve permanent integration into the job market by reinforcing the ratio of active to passive measures, in other words, by increasing the proportion of the unemployed in training, further training or retraining, because a lack of jobs is only one side of the coin. The other reason for unemployment in the European Union is the lack of professional qualifications. I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency for helping to improve the coordination of European employment policy. But the Community still has no long-term employment strategy to develop Community potential in terms of creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, the willingness to invest and the work ethic. Reforms to bolster dynamic competitiveness and flexibility need to be reconciled with the need both to maintain and to modernise the social security system. We see the European model as a social order for the social market economy.

 Mr President, Commissioner, in April the PPE Group voted for the legislative resolution on the directive on a European framework for informing and consulting workers in the Member States. Partnership and subsidiarity are the hallmark of the Parliament and Commission proposals. Companies should be provided with a tailor-made solution for informing and consulting workers, based on agreement between the two sides of industry. One of Parliament’s proposals is that existing national workers’ organisations must be involved in drawing up this agreement. It would be unthinkable to have an agreement that local works councils had not been involved in shaping! Although the Commission’s initial reaction to the various amendments was positive, they have not yet put forward an amended proposal, as you yourself have said. You cannot just put everything that was so carefully worked out in Parliament on ice! It is high time that the right conditions for a Council common position were created. There is obviously a lack of political will in the Council. How does the Commission view the situation, Commissioner? I did not entirely follow you. Does the Commission believe that the Finnish Presidency and possibly also the forthcoming Portuguese Presidency should be concerned that the United Kingdom, for example, might switch back to the opposition camp in the dispute over workers’ participation rights in the European Company, which has not yet been created? After all, it is an open secret that the British Government was only persuaded to support a European Company with minimum participation rights because of a promise to hold back on the directive on information and consultation for one year. When we have considered examples of company restructuring in this Chamber, we have often complained about management’s failure to provide information in good time, as with Hoover, Renault and Michelin. But we have some good news now. This relates to the success story of the directive on the European Works Council. For it to work well, national workers’ organisations at local level should be able to forward their information to the European Works Council, and they should have sufficient rights to react in good time. This directive will ensure that. I would like to state my question even more clearly, Commissioner: was I right in understanding you to say that the Commission does not intend to present an amended proposal before the end of this year? I would deeply regret that. Timely information for workers means transparency, which in turn creates confidence and avoids friction in European companies. Employers and employees stand to gain from this in equal measure.

 Mr President, Parliament originally gave me the job of preparing a report on the proposed Guidelines for Member States’ Employment Policies 2000. The wide-ranging debate and the many suggestions raised in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on employment policy in general encouraged me to divide my draft report in two, with conclusions and a legislative part concentrating on the proposals for guidelines for the year 2000, which the Council of Ministers must adopt in December 1999. Here in Parliament we should try to focus on the essentials, so that the Council’s response is not “less would be more”. On the day after the vote was taken in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Council also formally asked Parliament for an opinion. A simple consultation was therefore necessary. This means that legislative amendments may only be adopted without general conclusions. So for procedural reasons it became necessary to present two reports today, one on the Guidelines for Member States’ Employment Policies 2000 and on establishing an Employment Committee, and the other on the 1999 Joint Employment Report, which contains the conclusions adopted in committee. This second report begins with a positive message. The Community created 1.8 million additional jobs in 1998 by means of its employment-policy initiatives. However, youth and long-term unemployment are still at an unacceptably high level in most Member States, and, in any case, every single unemployed person is one too many. I do not want to look at the conclusions in detail now, but bearing in mind the debate at yesterday’s sitting on the macroeconomic dialogue, I would like to make one point: the European Parliament needs to be more closely involved in preparing and implementing the European Employment Pact. We regret that at the Cologne Summit the word “Parliament” was not mentioned in the paper on employment. That is really not on! We represent the public and are therefore the most important institution of the European Union. The opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities are attached to this second report on today’s agenda. Both opinions significantly enhanced the work of the Employment Committee. I would like to thank the draftspersons of the opinions, Mrs Theorin and Mr Grosch, for their excellent work. Many of their suggestions have found their way into both Employment Committee reports, 

but in order to keep things tight, we have had to make a selection. This means that the chances of their being accepted by the Council of Ministers are greater. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities worked very hard on the employment-policy guidelines, and we are now looking at the legislative section, that is at the first report on today’s agenda. It in turn consists of two parts, the first on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Employment Committee, and the second on the Commission’s proposal for Guidelines for Member States’ Employment Policies 2000. The Employment Committee is intended to play a consultative role in assisting the Member States’ coordination of employment and labour market policy. I have already mentioned the thrust of my report on the employment-policy guidelines: to concentrate on the essentials. It would be wrong to increase the number of guidelines any further. Instead, I would like to see practical implementation and verifiability of the guidelines and of the national action plans, based on concrete criteria. Simply increasing the number of guidelines will not create one single job. Quality not quantity should be the motto of modern employment policy. With regard to combating long-term and youth unemployment, effective and continued participation in the labour market can be achieved by switching from passive to active measures. Specifically, the percentage of the unemployed offered initial and further training or retraining is to be increased. We are seeking a target of 25% instead of the 20% in the Commission’s proposal. We need the most modern vocational training available. In this case, the existing guidelines need to be adjusted to the changing requirements of the labour market, especially as regards equipping schools with computers and Internet access. We need to pay special attention to female pupils and students here. A second requirement is access to the capital market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which create the bulk of new jobs through innovation. Promoting voluntary share ownership models for employees in conjunction with a clear reduction in administrative effort and a determined attack on the black economy could give a boost to job creation. Non-wage labour costs need to be lowered, because they have a direct impact on the competitiveness of medium-sized companies. Existing or new models for taxes on energy consumption should, however, be checked to see whether they are appropriate for maintaining balanced social security systems in the long run. Another means of combating unemployment named in the report is greater flexibility on the part of companies, which involves ensuring that they are provided with information and consulted at the appropriate time, thus enabling them to adapt to change. One way of achieving this is through minimum standards. Flexibility is also needed in working hours. We need intelligent labour models, such as the “breathing factory” concept, in which working time is adjusted in line with the level of activity. Working time is generally – but not always – reduced, instead of introducing a unilateral reduction in working hours without cuts in payment. That is no way to create new jobs, it just puts existing ones at risk. In the Commission’s draft, the four pillars of the guidelines are kept intact. The fourth pillar becomes the most important. It involves strengthening measures to promote equal opportunities for men and women. Coordination of European employment policy, especially by means of the employment-policy guidelines, should lead to a longer-term strategy of tapping the potential in society for creativity, innovation, entrepreneurialism, willingness to invest and a “can-do” attitude. Reforms aimed at promoting dynamic competition and flexibility need to be coordinated with the need to maintain but also modernise the social security system. That is how I see the European model. On that note, I ask you to vote for these two reports. (Applause)

 Madam President, I would like to make three preliminary remarks. Firstly, I would like to make it clear that the opinion I am presenting represents the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, even if my own views are somewhat different. That sometimes happens. Secondly, in some cases I am rejecting new amendments, where I think that they add nothing new in terms of content. I am in favour of presenting focused proposals to the Council of Ministers. Thirdly, there are, of course, other amendments that I am rejecting because of their content, such as Amendment No 46, which suggests reductions in working hours without cuts in payments are the only effective approach. I am in favour of flexible working.

 Madam President, with regard to Amendment No 13, I have nothing against the proposal to take a joint vote on this, but I wish to point out that the German version is incorrect. This amendment was also proposed as an oral amendment in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. That oral amendment from Mr Skinner is not included here, nor is Mrs Sbabarti’s statement on the policy with regard to disabled persons. This applies to the German version.

 Mr President, with regard to the restructuring of companies we have been referring to, I would emphasise the statement made in the four Groups’ joint motion for a resolution which has been mentioned. Global players 
in Europe have no choice other than to lay themselves open to competition in world markets. In the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party, instances of rejection on social grounds are simply to be avoided. None of this is a completely new phenomenon. When I first entered Parliament ten years ago, I was approached by works committees from a cable fibre factory in my constituency. Their company had just been taken over by a large group in France. The employees were hoping first of all to have more secure jobs now. More by chance than by anything else, they learned that the distant head office of the French concern wanted to close the factory it had taken over within three months. It is when sore points like this come up that the Directive on European Works Councils comes in. This has been predominantly successful. We should also let it be known here, as a success story and positive message, that 600 new European Works Councils have been created in the last couple of years. It is still often the case, though, that not enough information is provided soon enough. An amendment to the Directive would definitely be appropriate here, Commissioner.  Finally, we must also insist that all companies and groups fulfil their now legally accepted duties to offer information and consultation and that there must be consequences if they do not do so.  I close with the observation by the Christian Democrat Minister of Labour under whose chairmanship the Directive on European Works Councils was adopted. Lack of information results in uncertainty, mistrust and, in the end, only anxiety. Information and consultation mean transparency, which creates trust and does away with losses due to friction in European companies. Employers and employees are then winners in equal parts.
